"It is not an outbreak because the total number that we've seen are few in the districts. There are many districts that did not even report any. Out of that, only three of them belong to the group that caused the outbreak in the Brong Ahafo Region. The rest belong to another group...," Beifugbah was quoted as saying. Reports, however, indicate that at least 32 people have died in the west African country since the outbreak of the disease four weeks ago.According to Ghana web,&nbsp; more than 100 cases of Pneumococcal Meningitis had been reported in the country's southern region of Brong-Ahafo region.
