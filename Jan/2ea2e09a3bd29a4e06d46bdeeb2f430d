The billboard must not be lifted down, but, burnt down."One person commented: "We can't burn it down as it is pasted against an apartment block, people inside the apartment will burn to death. We can remove it though."Mkongi responded with: "They must burn to death as it is life for them to keep it that way."Bloem said the MP should be arrested."His call for the innocent residents of the building to be burnt along with the building is a new low in South African politics. Where is the ruling party recruiting its MPs from and what sort of sifting is it doing? Is this the best it can offer South Africa?," he asked.DA chief whip John Steenhuisen said they would also explore other venues of recourse against Mkongi."Mkongi's remarks are tantamount to hate speech and incitement to violence, and the Joint Committee on Ethics and Members' Interests needs to investigate this potential breach of the Code of Ethical Conduct and Disclosure of Members Interests as well as the Powers, Privileges And Immunities Of Parliament And Provincial Legislatures Act," Steenhuisen said.Bloem said Mkongi&rsquo;s statements had caused irreparable and immeasurable damage to South Africa.Mkongi apologised for his comments on Saturday, after the banner had been removed. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
