"There must be improved signage on dangerous beaches and we need to educate beach goers, making sure that they know that a rip current is the single biggest danger that they face on beaches," Robertson said. The busiest days for the NSRI were December 27, with 11 rescues, and January 1, with 10 rescues.Between December 1 and January 13 2016, the NSRI responded to 21 fatal drowning incidents and 17 non-fatal drowning incidents.Fourteen of these incidents involved children, eight of whom had drowned, he said."Sixty percent of children who got into difficulty drowned.
