Cleveland - A California attorney who unsuccessfully sued the government at least twice challenging the use of the phrase "under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance has filed a federal lawsuit in Ohio challenging a similar phrase on US currency and coins. Sacramento attorney Michael Newdow filed the lawsuit on Monday in Akron. The lawsuit argues the phrase "In God We Trust" on US money is unconstitutional and violates separation of church and state. The lawsuit wants the phrase prohibited from use on money. The lawsuit represents 41 plaintiffs from Ohio and Michigan, including many unnamed parents and children who are atheists or are being raised as atheists. Defendants include Congress and various federal agencies. A message seeking comment was left on Wednesday at the office of U. attorney for Ohio's northern district.
