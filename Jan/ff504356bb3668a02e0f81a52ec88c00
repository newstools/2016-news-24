livestock-farming zone, knew little about climate change, until recently when
the river they depend on for their livelihood ran dry. Residents of Bokwidi village, north-west of Polokwane, have
been forced to dig into the Mogalakwena River’s bed to find water for washing
and for their livestock, which they have depended on for decades. Over the past three months, the Mogalakwena - a combination
of the Tswana words mogala "fierce", and kwena "crocodile"
- has run dry. Now herdsmen are travelling long distances into the bush as
their herds go in search of greener pastures and water. Some cattle die along
the way. Keeping their animals alive is vital if they want to
maintain their way of life, but this is looking increasingly difficult. "We decided to dig in the river where we can see fresh
mud. That is the only way to keep our livestock alive," said Frans
Sebetha, secretary of local farmers’ association. Livestock farmer William Mokoka, 73, said he had never seen
Mogalakwena River without water. "This river never dried up since I was born, but now is
there is no river here. If you look it’s a bush," said Mokoka. Once they have dug into the river bed, they construct a
makeshift dam for their cattle. They have to stay and keep watch, in case the
animals get stuck in the mud. The farmers intend petitioning the local Mogalakwena
municipality for the provision of water. The provincial agriculture department
said recent rain had not helped improve the water levels in rivers and dams. However, the distribution of drought aid was underway. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
