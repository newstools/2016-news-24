"It has also been noted that the cases of maternal and neo-natal mortality have also been on the increase since the first of January," the report quoted the statement as saying. Meanwhile, a report by the state owned Herald newspaper on Friday claimed that state workers had agreed with government to postpone the strike after meeting with the reserve bank governor Dr John Mangudya, who pledged an immediate payment of government workers' salaries and bonuses. The report also revealed that government was planning to invoke section 65 of the country’s constitution that prohibits essential services workers which include doctors, and nurses from striking. The health workers have, however, vowed to intensify the strike as they would not be working for free. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
