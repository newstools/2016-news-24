Jenna Etheridge, News24 Cape Town – Egyptian Geese can be spirited and vocal at the best of times. But it was thanks to this wild flapping and screeching that a Cape Town resident was alerted to a gosling that had fallen down a drain. A pair of geese refused to budge from the road on Sunday until their offspring was safe and sound. Oranjezicht resident Allison Foat was driving to Signal Hill for a run when she spotted the parents with their 10 goslings in Hof Road. She stopped her car because they were "making such a racket" next to a stormwater drain opening.  (Photo: Paul van der Spuy) "They were flapping their wings and fussing and screeching. I got close to the drain and realised one of their babies had fallen through the grid," she told News24 on Tuesday. "I could tell they weren’t going to attack me, but they weren’t going to move." A resident in a nearby building, Devin Toselli, popped down to help. "A Blue Ribbon [bakery] truck driver also stopped his truck, jumped out and proceeded to help Devin prise the grid." Toselli wiggled his body into the drain, reached down and plucked the gosling out. It was reunited with its parents.  (Photo: Allison Foat) Foat said Toselli and his girlfriend later told her they herded the family to the gardens of Leeuwenhof Estate. Stressed at the time, she had not thought to ask for the truck driver’s name. Foat said he "saved the day" by lifting the heavy grid and went out of his way to help. She was trying to track him down. Foat credited the city’s emergency services and SPCA for offering to help. "It’s amazing how many people are out there who will really assist." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
