Syria is one and Ethiopia is the second. And so we've said we need to raise $100m for this response," Carolyn Miles, a representative of Save the Children,&nbsp;said.Al Jazeera's Charles Stratford, reporting from Afar region in eastern Ethiopia, says the government and international donors have already put in hundreds of millions of dollars to try and help, but aid agencies say it just is not enough.Mohammed Dubahala, a father of ten, used to have 53 cows; he has only five now.He received two government food handouts over recent months, but says it is not enough because of the scale of the drought."I am afraid for the people now and I am afraid for the children because there is no rain, and if there is no rain, people die. There is no food, there is no milk," Dubahala said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
