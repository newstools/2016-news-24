It was carried out yesterday [Monday], less than three days prescribed by law," defence lawyer Lateef Fagbemi told the court.The case follows a coroner's ruling in July last year that blamed the SCOAN and two engineers for the September 12, 2014 collapse that killed 116 people, most of them South African.The inquest verdict attributed the collapse of the six-storey guesthouse to structural failures and said it did not have planning permission.Joshua, dubbed "The Prophet" and "Man of God" by his followers, maintains a mysterious "hovering" aircraft that was seen over the building before the tragedy, or a controlled explosion, was to blame.He repeatedly failed to appear to give evidence at the inquest and was not present in court on Tuesday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
