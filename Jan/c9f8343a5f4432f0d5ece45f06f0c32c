	     Speaking at the first day of school at the Intshinga Primary School in Gugulethu, the Western Cape MEC for education said the province was ready for the school year.WATCH Cape Town – The Western Cape is as prepared
as it can be for the new school year, even as it dealt with late registration
and migration of pupils, the province's education MEC said on Wednesday. Visiting the Intshinga Primary School in
Gugulethu, Debbie Schäfer said a few areas were notorious for late
registration. These included the Metro North Regions, Strand, Paarl, and
Mfuleni. “And we are addressing these as best we
can.” She said there were no indications as yet
of how many pupils needed to be placed. She urged parents to approach their
local district office as soon as possible to get help finding a school for
their children. She said the province had a smooth start to
the school year. Publishers had delivered all the textbooks schools had ordered
via the department’s online system at the end of last year. Schools could place
top-up orders should they get more pupils. Suppliers had delivered additional desks
and chairs on time. The department had ordered extra mobile classrooms, which
would be relocated as needed. She said it was heartwarming to see so many
parents accompanying their children to school on their first day. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
