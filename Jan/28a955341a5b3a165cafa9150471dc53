	     Mombasa - A court in Kenya has found a teacher at an Islamic school guilty of radicalising his students by teaching them extreme jihad and sentenced him to 20 years in prison. Magistrate Diana Mochache said Thursday Samwel Wanjala Wabwile, also known as Salim Mohammed, was found guilty of radicalizing the Gotani primary school pupils. Mochache says Wabwile, who also taught at a mosque in Gotani village in Kilifi county, had been hiding behind religion to promote extremism. Kenya is battling recruitment of the country's youth by al-Qaeda's East African affiliate, Somalia-based al-Shabaab, and lately the Islamic State. Kenyan youth make up the largest contingent of foreign fighters in al-Shabaab. Al-Shabaab has carried out a wave of attacks in Kenya since it sent its troops to Somalia to fight the militants. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
