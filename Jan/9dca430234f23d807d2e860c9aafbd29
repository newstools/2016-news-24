Durban - A man alleged to have killed four people during an
argument over cattle in Mahlabathini has been arrested, KwaZulu-Natal police
said on Sunday. The 32-year-old was arrested on Saturday and a firearm with
one live round was confiscated, said Major Thulani Zwane. On the evening of January 1, he was at home in Dlebe meeting
with his father to iron out a dispute over cattle. His father decided to ask
neighbours to come over to listen and mediate because they had a
misunderstanding. The man allegedly pulled out his gun and shot everyone in
the house, killing four people including his father. Four other people were
seriously wounded. He ran away and police had been looking for him. The man will appear in court next week to face four charges
of murder and four charges of attempted murder.
