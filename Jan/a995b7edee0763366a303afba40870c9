	     Cape Town – Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa was unable
to attend the ANC’s gala dinner in Sun City on Friday because he was caught up
in South Sudan with plane problems, the Presidency said on Saturday. Spokesperson Bongani Majola said it was a “shocking
fabrication” on Mail & Guardian’s part to allege there was any tension
between Ramaphosa and President Jacob Zuma because he did not attend the dinner. “The newspaper goes on to claim that the absence of the deputy
president took other leaders by surprise and also mentions a lot of other
gossip and innuendo. This is preposterous,” he said. Ramaphosa was in Juba in his capacity as a special envoy
of Zuma. He was supposed to arrive back in the country in time for
the dinner. “However, his South African Air Force plane developed
technical difficulties and he had to return back home commercially. He landed
back around 01:30 in South Africa during which time the gala dinner had ended.” Majola said the defence department was exploring
solutions to the problems of the current planes that broke down and caused
inconvenience. The newspaper stated that Zuma appeared to be in the dark
about his deputy’s whereabouts. It stated Zuma had to do “damage control” after ANC
Women’s League treasurer and International Relations Minister Maite
Nkoana-Mashabane told guests at the dinner that Ramaphosa was expected to be at
the event. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
