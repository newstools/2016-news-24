Given the importance you ascribe to this matter, I can only accept," he said in a televised New Year address."You clearly expressed your choices for the future of our country. The process allowed us the time to make certain that the proposed changes had merit and wisdom," said Kagame, who described national unity as "unshakably strong".The referendum followed more than 60% of voters signing a petition calling for the drafting of constitutional changes that would allow Kagame to stand again.Both houses of parliament are dominated by his Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF).His supporters maintain that Kagame, an English speaker from the Tutsi ethnic group targeted in the genocide by Hutu majority extremists, is not an autocratic figure but a beacon of stability who has overseen economic growth.Several African states have recently lifted or tried to lift constitutional bars to multiple presidential mandates.Such was the case in neighbouring Burundi, which descended into bloodshed in April when President Pierre Nkurunziza announced his intention to run for a controversial third term in a July election that he went on to win.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
