There is a financial incentive to the grim lie," he added.The Herald said that Mugabe was in the "Far East" but did not specify which country.The president, who is the world's oldest national leader, has ruled Zimbabwe since independence in 1980.Despite his age, he continues to give long speeches in public, but speculation over his health mounted last year when he tripped and fell down some steps at a televised ceremony.He also read a speech to parliament in September apparently unaware that he had delivered the same address a month earlier.WikiLeaks in 2011 released a 2008 US diplomatic cable saying that Mugabe was reported to have prostate cancer and had less than five years to live.His regime is accused of systematic human rights abuses and overseeing Zimbabwe's dire economic decline.The ruling ZANU-PF party has been riven by factionalism for years with Mugabe avoiding naming a successor.Senior Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa is seen as one front-runner to be the next president.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
