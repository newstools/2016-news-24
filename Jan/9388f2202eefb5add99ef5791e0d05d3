On Thursday, one of the council's leaders, Shanky Mokoena, said they were shocked to learn about the discovery of the body, which was found on Wednesday morning. "As traditional leaders, we want to condemn this act. People must stop killing others, as this is an indication it was done for muthi purposes. This has happened in our own backyard and it is shocking," said Mokoena. Mokoena said it was possible that the people who killed the man knew him. "It could be an act of people who live around the area and knew the deceased was vulnerable. Even if they came from far away, it was not supposed to have happened. We call upon those with information to come forward and assist the police in this matter," said Mokoena. Provincial police spokesperson Sergeant Gerald Sedibe said some community members had found the body at around 6:00 on Wednesday. "The body was dumped on the street at Tsakani Trust in Marite near Hazyview. When police arrived at the scene, which is not far from the murdered man’s house, they inspected the body and found that his genital organs, lips and nose had been removed," said Sedibe on Thursday. Sedibe said preliminary investigations revealed that the man was killed inside his house before his body was dragged and dumped in the streets. He said no suspects had yet been arrested. "Police are investigating a case of murder," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
