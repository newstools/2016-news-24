Here's a look at the beach on New Year's Day. WATCHDurban - An unfortunate Pretoria IT technician found himself on the receiving end of a social media backlash, after his phone number was confused with that of a central figure in the Penny Sparrow racism debacle. Sparrow had taken to Facebook and described black beachgoers as "monkeys", in an apparent reaction to litter left after New Year&rsquo;s celebrations. Clayton Ackerman told News24 on Monday that he has a cellphone number very similar to that of Jawitz Property CEO Herschel Jawitz - only a one digit difference - and from early on Monday morning had been catching flak. "A man phoned me at 7:00 already asking me what I was going to do with my racist employee. I told him he had the wrong number and he seemed to understand, but the others didn&rsquo;t," he said.Jawitz earlier said Sparrow left the company two months ago."So many people have been WhatsApping directly, sending me pictures of monkeys and I had no idea what was going on," Ackerman added. Eventually, realising his trolls were looking for Jawitz, he called the property company, who explained the furore. "I don&rsquo;t read the newspapers so when I phoned Jawitz to see what was going on, they told me and I saw the story was so massive. I just want people to dial the right number," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
