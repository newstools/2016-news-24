	     Harare – Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has criticised journalists over what he described as "negative reporting" on African issues, a report has said.  According to the Sunday Mail, Mugabe, 91, accused journalists of ignoring positive things happening on the continent. He said journalists, including those from Africa, focused their attention on negative stories.  "… Of course we also feel that our journalists should report us better than they have been doing all along, including yourselves. Report the good things that Africa is doing. There are many [positive stories], including football," Mugabe was quoted saying.  Mugabe said this while addressing journalists after a meeting with his Equatorial Guinea counterpart President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who was in the southern African nation on a three-day state visit.  Mugabe has been at odds with the media lately, with recent reports saying that he suffered a heart attack while on his annual holiday in the Far East. The nonagenarian arrived back home on Friday in good health, according to a News24 report. This time last year, Mugabe slipped on a carpet when he returned from an African Union summit in Addis Ababa, provoking a storm of comment and much online humour.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
