In a statement, NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon said the NSRI Witbank team attended the scene where they found the Langa Ambulance Service treating two local 17-year-old males, one of whom suffered a suspected fractured pelvis while the other suffered a fractured leg. Lambinon said an 18-year-old female was treated for shock."The two males were transported to hospital in stable but serious conditions and the female was transported to hospital in a stable condition. It appears that the two teenage males were being towed on a floating tractor tyre tube by a ski-boat when the tyre tractor tube is believed to have hit rocks reportedly causing them to be flung off the tyre tube and sustaining injuries."It is believed that the female assisted them in the water before paramedics arrived."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
