Rwanda has denied all the claims."I can guarantee that there will not be a genocide in Burundi," Nkurunziza said, adding that Burundi is "99 percent secure".Nkurunziza's refusal to compromise has raised the prospect of tougher measures ahead to stop almost nightly outbreaks of violence.Clashes in Bujumbura on Thursday evening left three people dead, police said, including one youth who was shot dead by police after a grenade went off. Explosions and gunfire were heard in several places across the capital.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
