Ahmed Areff and Mpho Raborife, News24Johannesburg -&nbsp;Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant General Lesetja Mothiba has been redeployed to a new management intervention unit in the SA Police Service's head office, the Hawks confirmed on Saturday.&nbsp;"He has been redeployed, and will be at the intervention unit. He will be responsible for the assessment of the SAPS," Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said.&nbsp;"[Soweto cluster commander] Major-General Eric Nkuna will be acting in that position [of Gauteng police commissioner]." The Democratic Alliance expressed concern over the "sudden decision" regarding Mothiba. &nbsp; "While the move may be regarded as a step up for Mothiba, the fact that the appointment of his replacement, Major General Eric Nkuna, is on an acting basis, creates the impression that the shift was politically motivated," DA MPL Kate Lorimer said in a statement.She said Mothiba was a career policeman who had dedicated more than 30 years of his life to the police force, and&nbsp; his absence would be felt by every policing structure in the province.&nbsp;Gauteng polisiekommisaris Lesetja Mothiba eis ondersoek na Edenvale polisiestasie. http://t.co/Aolm3lcSWT pic.twitter.com/5sorMOcxzA 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
