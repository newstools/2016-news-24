A pastoral letter by the church also urged the Malawian government not to legalise what it termed "a sin", urging its members to speak out against homosexuality and abortion, according to Nyasa Times. The letter, was read to its congregates on Sunday, the report said. The CCAP advised its members to pray against the legalisation of laws that would allow "sin" such as same-sex marriage and abortion, saying:&nbsp;"God's wrath comes because of such ills in society". This comes a few weeks after a group of Catholic bishops from the Archdiocese of Blantyre laid out their position on homosexuality during a discussion with President Peter Mutharika. The bishops urged Mutharika not to be swayed on gay rights, saying gay rights were foreign to Malawians. "As the Catholic Church, we say no to supporting these gay activities and we will follow strictly our church doctrines," the bishop were quoted as saying. Under the current law, those found guilty of homosexuality in Malawi, can be sentenced to up to 14 years in prison, with hard labour. However, Justice Minister Samuel Tembenu recently indicated that the laws against homosexuality would be reviewed. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
