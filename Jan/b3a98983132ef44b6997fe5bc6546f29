Cape Town – Firefighters have extinguished a blaze that tore through the Elgin Valley in the Western Cape, Overberg fire chief Reinhard Geldenhuys said on Tuesday. However, they remained on high alert because hot and windy conditions threatened to cause flare-ups. Geldenhuys said that noon to 16:00 was "trouble time" and they had extra teams on standby. "If we leave the area unattended, we will be in trouble." He said the vegetation fire, which started on Saturday afternoon, had spanned 3 500-4 000 hectares. Flames came within metres of the Old Mac Daddy luxury trailer park. A couple had just made their wedding vows when they had to be evacuated. The fire also ripped through the nearby Ross Gower Wines plot, damaging a vineyard, buildings, a caravan, trailers, a diesel tank, and wooden pallets. On Tuesday afternoon, firefighters attended to a large vegetation near Blue Rock Resort, near Sir Lowry’s Pass. The fire posed no danger to property, said Cape Town fire and rescue spokesperson Liezl Moodie. Around 10 firefighting vehicles and almost 50 firefighters attended to the scene. She said the affected portion of the N2 highway remained opened. Metro police officers were on scene to ensure motorists’ safety.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
