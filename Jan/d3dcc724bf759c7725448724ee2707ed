When will there be change in Zimbabwe?," they asked.According to a&nbsp;Newsday&nbsp;report, Mugabe was also excluded from an AU meeting in July 2015 after he was snubbed by US President Barack Obama.Mugabe will attend his last meeting as chairperson of the AU on January 30 and 31 in Ethiopia. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
