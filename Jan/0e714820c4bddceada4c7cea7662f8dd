Local council official Matthew Muleya told the&nbsp;Sunday&nbsp;News, "What happened is that a pride of lions killed a cow and villagers, as [is] the norm here, teamed up to scare the lions away so that they recover the meat."He said the villagers were guarding the carcass and intended to take it away to share the next day. Muleya told the paper, "Unbeknown to them... the oldest female lion of the pride was sneaking [up] on them."Tshuma was reportedly unable to get away fast enough.
