But in a brief address to the court, he insisted that reading out the charges was "a waste of time".Gumpert showed a video of bodies in a grave, saying the court would also see other evidence of the "ferocity" of the attacks by the LRA.Ongwen, who is about 40 years old, ordered attacks and killings of civilians and the abduction and enslavement of children to be rebel soldiers, Gumpert said.Witnesses said Ongwen told his troops "at least on one occasion to kill, cook and eat civilians," Gumpert added.A former child-soldier-turned-warlord, Ongwen was Kony's one-time deputy.The LRA is accused of slaughtering more than 100 000 people and abducting 60 000 children in its bloody rebellion against Kampala that began in 1986.The prosecution is focusing in particular on four attacks on camps housing people forced to flee the LRA's violence.More than 130 people - many of them children and babies - died in these attacks and dozens of others were abducted, prosecutors said in the court document containing the charges.The LRA first emerged in northern Uganda in 1986, where it claimed to fight in the name of the Acholi ethnic group against the government of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.But over the years the LRA has moved across porous regional borders: it shifted from Uganda to sow terror in southern Sudan before moving into northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, and finally crossing into southeastern Central African Republic in March 2008.Combining religious mysticism with a bent for astute guerrilla tactics and bloodthirsty ruthlessness, Kony has turned scores of young girls into his personal sex slaves while claiming to be fighting to impose the Bible's Ten Commandments.Born in 1975, Ongwen was transferred to The Hague a year ago shortly after he unexpectedly surrendered to US special forces operating in the Central African Republic.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
