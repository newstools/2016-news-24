They were involved in leasing office space to the Northern Cape Social Development Department at inflated prices.Scholtz was a director in Trifecta Holdings, which secured the tenders for the leases.&nbsp; The department rented Trifecta&rsquo;s buildings in Kimberley, Upington and Springbok.Block used his political influence to secure tenders for Trifecta and received kickbacks for his efforts. He had claimed that he was not in the state&rsquo;s employ when the crimes were committed and that the money Trifecta paid him was for consulting services.Once regarded as the most powerful man in the Northern Cape, Block - former provincial ANC chairperson and MEC - arrived at court on Monday alone, having driven himself.Block resigned from his position as ANC provincial chair, ANC Northern Cape MPL, and economic development MEC, two days after the guilty verdict.Another accused, former ANC MP Yolanda Botha, who served on Parliament&rsquo;s social development portfolio committee when the crimes took place, died in December 2014.
