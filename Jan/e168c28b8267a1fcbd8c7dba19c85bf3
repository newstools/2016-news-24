It is understood that a man in his seventies was confronted by a burglar in his kitchen after he woke up and went to get a drink of water. According to a Facebook post by SA Community Crime Watch, a lone suspect had forced his way into a home in a gated estate in Waterfall, Durban. "[A] resident woke up to get water and was confronted by [the] suspect in kitchen. A scuffle ensued and the resident’s wife came through and helped her husband." "The elderly visitors, who are on holiday from the UK and in their 70's, fought hard and the suspect will now sport a few scratch marks on his face. The couple sustained bruises and some scuff marks, but are in good spirit," the post read. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Nqobile Gwala said police were investigating the robbery. She said that several items of value had been stolen by the man who fled after the scuffle. "The suspect managed to get out of the house through the window. Two cellphones, two tablets and a laptop were taken. No arrests have been made and investigations are continuing," she added. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
