She posed for a picture with a cardboard cut-out of Kruger with a hand-held placard with the words "Lekker verjaar Oom Paul [Happy birthday Uncle Paul]"."The DA MP's unashamed glorification and admiration of such a reprehensible figure is a tacit endorsement of the heinous crimes against humanity he perpetrated against black South Africans," Mothapo said. The DA said this showed the ruling party's growing desperation to divide the country along racial lines. National spokesperson and MP Phumzile Van Damme said the country had a rich and complex history, which could not be wished away. Past injustices had to be recognised and learnt from, she said."The ANC has clearly given up on this important project, determined to dictate how history should be remembered."This is because they continue to lose electoral support rapidly and are clutching at every straw to once again gain relevance in the lives of the millions of South Africans they have let down," Van Damme said.Van Damme advised Mothapo to stop his "gimmicks" and help ANC chief whip Stone Sizani to run Parliament in a way that ensured the voices and interests of all South Africans were heard.Mothapo said the ANC was considering what steps to take against Dreyer.The ANC on Wednesday accused DA leader Mmusi Maimane of paying lip-service to non-racialism by allowing MP Dianne Kohler Barnard to continue serving in Parliament.The ANC has approached Parliament's ethics committee to take steps against Kohler Barnard.The DA, in turn, wants the committee to take action against ANC MP Bongani Mkongi,&nbsp;who called on people to burn down the Cape Town building from which the "Zuma Must Fall" banner was hung. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
