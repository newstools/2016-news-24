	     Bloemfontein – A Free State woman watched in despair as a wall fell on her daughter during strong winds on Wednesday afternoon. Another woman was killed in the accident on a horse farm in Douglas Valley, Bloemfontein.  "There was a major wind blowing and everyone moved to the wall to avoid the wind, but I decided to hide under the tree," Linda Geldenhuys said. "While I was sitting under a tree, I saw the wall falling and I screamed at the top of my lungs for my daughter and the deceased to move away from there, but it was too late," she said.  Her daughter Liané, 19, survived with serious head injuries. Netcare 911 paramedics said Maurece van Niekerk, 43, died due to extensive injuries she sustained. "When I called out to my daughter, she was just lying there and she did not respond, and then my younger daughter called her. She managed to answer. It was a sigh of relief to actually hear her respond, I really thought she was gone," said Geldenhuys. She said she had met Van Niekerk to buy a horse for her younger daughter. The daughter was riding the horse when the accident happened. "I really feel so guilty right now that my daughter is alive and I couldn’t do anything to help Maurece," said Geldenhuys. Liané, a second-year student at the Central University of Technology, was recovering in the Bloemfontein Mediclinic. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
