They wanted existing laws which either did not set a minimum age for marriage or allowed it from the age of 16 to be declared unconstitutional in the light of Zimbabwe's new charter, which was adopted at a referendum in 2013. The Constitutional Court did just that.Child marriage is a significant problem in Zimbabwe, fuelled, say activists, by some popular Apostolic Christian sects which allow marriage of a much younger girl to an older man. Rights groups say about 21 percent of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s children, mostly girls, are married before the age of 18.Said Veritas in a statement, "This progressive decision is a mark that the Zimbabwe Constitutional Court is building up a body of constitutional jurisprudence which will also be quoted in other jurisdictions and should assist the Africa-wide campaign against child marriage."The Harare-based Research and Advocacy Unit tweeted: "@veritaszim congrats on the ground breaking judgement we are excited to see the law implemented! #ChildMarriages".However, marriages contracted by under-age persons before this ruling will not be declared invalid."The court is cognisant of the immense disruption that a retrospective declaration of invalidity may cause on the persons who conducted themselves on the basis that the legislation was valid," the ruling reads.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
