	     Cape Town - Loud wails could be heard as the tiny white casket of Inganathi Mnyeni was carried into her family's Philippi home for her funeral on Thursday morning.  Mourners crowded the street and wiped away tears as they sang and prayed silently. The mother of seven-month-old Inganathi, who was allegedly murdered by her ex-boyfriend, was beginning to cope with the untimely death of her little girl, her family said.  The infant's murder has been difficult for the family, an uncle Bongani Nunu said. "Even at her young age, she wasn't naughty. Inganathi was a quiet baby." "She was a child who listened," he said. Suspect arrested Zukile Nakupi was arrested on Thursday. He allegedly flung Inganathi against the ceiling, walls and prepaid electricity meter of her mother's Philippi home last Monday.  The couple allegedly started arguing after she woke up to feed the baby in the early hours of the morning. He reportedly jumped on Inganathi's body, despite attempts from her 7-year-old sister to protect her.  The infant died at the scene. Nakupi was on the run for four days before his arrest. He remains in custody after he appeared in the Athlone Magistrate's Court on Monday.  The matter was postponed until March 2 for consultation with his legal aid lawyer and a bail application.
