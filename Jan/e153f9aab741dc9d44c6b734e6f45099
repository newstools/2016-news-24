This includes supporting efforts to increase the volume of water in the Brandvlei Dam," he said."In this regard, we have established an inter-governmental and industry task team. The expansion of the Brandvlei Dam also seeks to mitigate the impact of future water shortages for the wine industry."Diemersfontein viticulturist Waldo Kellerman said normal production has been affected by the drought, meaning they would have to buy in grapes from other producers, who were also running short.Alternatively, they buy in wine from other cellars.The last "decent" rainfall was recorded in June last year, Kellerman explained."Harvest season will also probably be shortened from six weeks to four," he said.Grape picker Gerrit Smith demonstrated an example of the effect the drought had had on the harvest."It becomes shrivelled up and starts to look like a raisin," he said, holding up a bunch.&nbsp;"While some of it can still be used, the more badly affected grapes won't make the cut."Despite the loss in harvest, upping the price of their product is a last resort, Kellerman said."The wine market is very sensitive. It's extremely competitive. If you should increase your price by R10, you may lose the customer who would rather switch brands than pay more."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
