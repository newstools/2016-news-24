It has reduced the number significantly. It is now hovering at less than 7 000, from the 16 000/17 000 that we had," Lesufi told reporters.When public schools reopened last week, Lesufi assured parents that no pupil would miss school this year because they had not been placed.Lesufi admitted that increasing the size of classes would create obstacles in the near future."The schools are coming on board, but it's going to create problems. I want to be upfront with parents, there will be learners that will have to share desks. There will be learners that have to share textbooks. There will be a teacher [who] will be overwhelmed with the number of [pupils in] the classroom," he said.The department was looking at building extra classrooms and using mobile rooms.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
