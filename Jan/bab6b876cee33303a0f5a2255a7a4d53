Cape Town – Family and friends gathered in Soweto on
Saturday morning to mourn the loss of UJ student Palesa Madiba, whose bones
were found three years after she went missing. Her relatives described her as a “bright, spirited and
intellectual young woman but equally respectful”, in a booklet handed out at
the memorial service. It started at 09:00 at the Soweto campus of the University
of Johannesburg (UJ). A private burial would take place afterwards. “She genuinely loved people – her heart-melting smile was
testimony to this. She loved her studies and she was a massive Orlando Pirates
FC and Barcelona FC supporter,” her obituary read. Madiba was born in Diepkloof, Soweto, on November 7, 1992.
She enrolled for a Bachelor of Commerce degree in Accounting at UJ in 2011. She went missing on August 9, 2013. ‎She had spent the
weekend at a friend's house in Phiri and was expected home in Diepkloof on the
Monday evening. Her remains were found on December 16 when police received
an anonymous tip-off. Her body was buried in the backyard of her friend’s home
in Phiri, where she was last seen. Her obituary stated that she loved ballroom dancing and
played volleyball, netball and tennis. She is survived by her mother, six sisters and two brothers.
Her family thanked everyone for their support.
