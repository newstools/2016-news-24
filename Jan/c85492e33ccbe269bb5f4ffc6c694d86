He wants this trial to unveil the truth," Altit added.Gbagbo and his supporters - some 1 500 of whom plan to protest outside the modern glass-fronted ICC building - in turn accuse Paris of plotting to oust him and charge Ouattara's camp with retributions dubbed "victor's justice".Lawyers for Ble Goude told AFP he would plead "not guilty" as he was "determined to establish the truth about all the charges levelled against him." "Quite simply the facts show that Charles Ble Goude is not a criminal as they would have us believe," said his lawyer Claver N'Dry.After years of delays partly due to Gbagbo's claims of ill-health, human rights lawyers say the trial will provide "redress that is long overdue, and shed light on the power structure that led to mass abuses during the post-election crisis.""Pro-Gbagbo forces wreaked havoc in Cote d'Ivoire, committing unspeakable abuses including gang rapes, torture, and murder," added Param-Preet Singh, senior counsel at Human Rights Watch.During a trial likely to last three to four years, prosecutors intend to present 5 300 elements of proof including videos, as well as 138 potential witnesses.The charges focus on four events, including a December 2010 attack on Ouattara supporters when 33 people were killed during a march to an Ivorian television station.Another incident was the shelling of the Abobo market quarter in March 2011 in northern Abidjan in which 40 people died.The hearing will start at 09:30 (08:30 GMT), and after the pleas ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda will lay out the case, followed by representatives of 726 victims, and then the defence lawyers.Gbagbo's wife Simone is also wanted for crimes against humanity by the ICC, but the government refuses to hand her over.Another 78 people have also been brought before Ivorian courts.In October, Ouattara was re-elected in a landslide victory with almost 84% of the vote in the nation's first peaceful vote in more than a decade.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
