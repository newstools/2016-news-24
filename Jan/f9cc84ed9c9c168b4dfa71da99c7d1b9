Cape Town - An 8-year-old girl was injured when her leg got caught under a merry-go-round in Keurboom Park near Kenilworth in the Western Cape on Thursday, paramedics said. "Paramedics found the young patient lying next to the merry-go-round with her right leg trapped beneath it," ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said. "Rescue services had to use the Jaws-of-Life equipment to lift the merry-go-round off the childâ€™s leg." Once freed, the girl was taken to Vincent Palloti Hospital.
