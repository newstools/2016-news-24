They operate a surgical clinic with 120 beds, where Ken Elliott is the sole surgeon and is supported by local staff."They have dedicated their lives to providing medical relief to people in the remote northern area of Burkina Faso," the statement said. It added that their commitment to the local people is reflected in the fact that they have continued there with only a few holidays since 1972. "They are held in high esteem by the local people."Richard Lugg, who studied medicine with Ken Elliott at the University of Western Australia in the couple's hometown of Perth, described him as a friendly and dedicated man who had given a lifetime of service to the people of Burkina Faso."It is tragic that at the end of his career, this should happen to him," Lugg told Australian Broadcasting Corp.Ken Elliott said in an undated Global Business Solutions Inc. video recorded in Djibo that the couple were motivated to build their medical center at Djibo because of the local need."Our great thrust is surgery because that is in our opinion lacking throughout the country and throughout the region of West Africa," Elliott said."The commonest things we would do I suppose are hernias, bladder stones, we do all sorts of tumors &mdash; you name it, we do it because there's nowhere else to do it," he said.The couple had two sons, a daughter and three grandchildren, Lugg said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
