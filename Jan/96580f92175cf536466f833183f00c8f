Durban â€“ A man who claimed to be a police major general was
arrested when he went to report a crime at a KwaZulu-Natal police station. The 43-year-old, from Ndaya Reserve, was arrested when he
went to the Esikhaleni police station on Friday to report a robbery at his
home, police spokesperson Major Thulani Zwane said on Monday. "He introduced himself as the major general, the
cluster commander in Mpumalanga province. He failed to produce proof of being a
police officer." Police discovered that had been released on parole in 2013.
Police confiscated a police T-shirt and a reflector jacket found in his home.
His identity document had been tampered with. He was arrested and charged with impersonating a police officer,
perjury, and possession of stolen property. He would appear in the Esikhaleni
Magistrate's Court on Monday. KwaZulu-Natal police commissioner, Lieutenant General
Mmamonnye Ngobeni, commended Esikhaleni police for their vigilance. Officers
would determine if he could be linked to other crimes.
