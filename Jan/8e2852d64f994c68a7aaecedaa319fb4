It will, however, take some time for reservoirs to fill up enough water for normal supply to resume in all affected areas."Chuene advised residents to limit their water usage for immediate household needs to avoid a further decline in its availability.&nbsp;The affected areas included Flora Park, Serala View, Ster Park, Bendor and parts of Seshego, Chuene said.&nbsp;Water tankers were being deployed to the affected areas.Those who had access to transport could also make use of the water treatment plants at Dalmada, along the R71 to Mankweng and Seshego &nbsp;Zone 4, between 06:00 and 22:00 daily, Chuene said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
