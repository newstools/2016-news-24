He put a post on Facebook expressing his hatred for white people.&nbsp;&ldquo;Reasons I hate white people: white privilege, white dominance, white arrogance, white monopoly capital and white superiority. Fuck white people, just get me a bazooka or AK47 so I can do the right thing and kill these demon possed [sic] humans.&rdquo;&nbsp;University spokesperson Anna-Retha Bouwer said they had taken note of his statements and were investigating in terms of their disciplinary code for students and the SRC&rsquo;s code of conduct. &ldquo;We strongly condemn hate speech and threats of violence,&rdquo; she said.Menziwa ended his post by quoting Steve Biko: &ldquo;The basic tenet of black consciousness is that the black man must reject all value systems that seek to make him a foreigner in the country of his birth and reduce his basic human dignity.&rdquo;Trade union Solidarity said Menziwa should be dismissed from his position. The university should suspend him and he should face criminal charges.&nbsp;Solidarity&rsquo;s organiser at the university, Jahni Cowley, said it was tragic that one student was threatening the racial harmony many were trying to promote.&ldquo;Our members cannot be expected to turn up for work while a self-confessed murderous student is roaming free on campus,&rdquo; she said.Menziwa's statement followed protests by black pupils at the Pretoria High School for Girls, against racism and how they had to wear their hair.Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi spent Monday at the school, addressing the issue.&nbsp;It was agreed that the section of the school&rsquo;s code of conduct dealing with hairstyles would be suspended. He ordered an investigation into the alleged racism.The Freedom Front Plus called on Lesufi to also intervene in the Menziwa matter. The party&rsquo;s Philip van Staden said they were interested to know what Lesufi&rsquo;s reaction would be.&ldquo;Lesufi plays a dangerous game. In a way he promotes black on white racism if he only reacts when black children complain. &nbsp;On the other hand he said nothing about the Tuks incident,&rdquo; Van Staden said. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
