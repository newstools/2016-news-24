It should insist that we honour the agreement that we reached during the constitutional negotiations. It should resolutely oppose unfair discrimination against any South African citizen and reject racial ideologies that result in new forms of racial discrimination and domination.&rdquo;De Klerk said the centre should call on government to implement the Constitution&rsquo;s language and culture provisions.&nbsp;It should encourage dialogue between South Africans, to promote positive relations.&ldquo;If we do this, we will achieve the vision of unity in diversity.&rdquo;&nbsp;De Klerk said the current ANC government had adopted policies that were consciously harming the &ldquo;core interest of a section of the South African population&rdquo;.&nbsp;&ldquo;I think the centre can become a player in changing the present climate in South Africa on the issue of race.&rdquo;It needed to do so in conjunction with other organisations in society. &ldquo;We need to stop this deteriorating race issue in South Africa,&rdquo; he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
