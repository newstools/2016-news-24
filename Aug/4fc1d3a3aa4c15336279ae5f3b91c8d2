	     Cape Town - Durbanville High School is waiting to hear if a Stellenberg High rugby player will be disciplined for punching a Durbanville player in the face on Saturday. Durbanville principal George Germishuys told Netwerk24 the incident occurred after the game, when the two teams shook hands. When the Stellenberg forward walked past one of the Durbanville backs, he punched him in the face instead of shaking his hand. “I was standing close to them and saw it happen,” Germishuys said. “I couldn’t hear if anything was said before the incident, so I have no idea why he did it.” The boy’s teammates pulled him off the Durbanville boy, whose nose was bleeding. Durbanville’s first team coach Shaun Huygen said he spoke to Stellenberg’s coaches. They told him they would handle it internally. Stellenberg principal Theo Boonzaaier told Netwerk24 a committee of senior staff would investigate and decide on the necessary steps. “Our player was extremely upset. He didn’t come to school on Monday, so I haven’t spoken to him yet,” Germishuys said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
