"Nobody must be victimised. Nobody must think they are above the law. Everybody has to act within the mandates that have been put in place," she said. Ndabeni-Abrahams said the communications ministry was waiting for a report from the board on the situation at the SABC. "We are waiting for the report from the board. We are clear that all process has to be followed. It doesn't matter who you are. If as government we said these are the [processes] everybody must adhere to... everybody has to act within the mandate we have put in place." Ndabeni-Abrahams promised the ministry would act accordingly against any transgressors at the SABC. The SABC has been criticised after its chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng decided to stop airing footage of violent protests. The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) ordered that the SABC must reverse its decision following a court application by the Helen Suzman Foundation. Icasa has since said that the SABC had agreed to abide by Icasa's order. Eight journalists were fired for speaking out against the revised policy. The journalists were later reinstated after taking the public broadcaster to the Labour Court.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
