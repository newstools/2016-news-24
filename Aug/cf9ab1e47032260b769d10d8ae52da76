Athlone was shot and robbed of his service pistol early on Thursday morning,
Western Cape police said. Four armed suspects attacked the sergeant at the voting
station around 02:00, on the corner of Lawrence Road and Pliny Street,
according to Lieutenant Colonel André Traut. "The member sustained a gunshot wound and was admitted
to hospital in a stable condition," he said. "The suspects fled the scene in a silver Toyota Avanza
and are yet to be arrested. The second member stationed at the voting station
at the time of the attack was not harmed in the incident." All voting-related proceedings had already been concluded at
the station at the time and the attackers did not enter the
building, Traut said. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General
Khombinkosi Jula warned that attacks on police were an attack on the State and
would not be taken lightly. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
