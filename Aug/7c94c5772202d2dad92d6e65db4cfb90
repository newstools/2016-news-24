One line from this bundle anchored it to the seabed.When night fell, the team decided to return on Friday morning.A larger humpback whale was circling&nbsp;while the operation was in progress.SAWDN volunteers managed to attach a buoy to one of the lines, which brought the whale to the surface and seemed to calm it down.
