Between R15 000 to R150 000 per site, per month. Replying to a parliamentary question from the DA's Chris Hunsinger on the cost of advertising at the Cape Town International Airport and whether political parties got any discounts, Airports Company South Africa (Acsa) said they did not deal directly with political parties.They said airport advertising sites were concessions to out-of-home media owners from one month up to 5 years, and these entities paid ACSA monthly rentals irrespective of securing an advertiser.&nbsp; The advertising concessionaire in-turn secured advertisers, they said in the reply. "Airports Company South Africa is, however, aware of one political party advertising at the three national airports (OR Tambo, King Shaka and Cape Town International Airport) for the period June 2016 to end August 2016 through advertising concessionaire called Provantage Pty Ltd ("Provantage"). The amount invoiced by Airports Company South Africa to Provantage for the sites is R346, 619.00 per month excluding VAT," they said. There were no discounts given to the political party, they told Hunsinger.&nbsp; Acsa also clarified that it had not acted on behalf of any political parties to advertise in the specified airport in the specified period. &nbsp; The reply was sent through by transport Minister Dipuo Peters.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
