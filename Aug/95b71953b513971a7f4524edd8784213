Western Cape police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk said the 26-year-old from Wanderers was nabbed with the foil-wrapped packages in her luggage after landing on a flight from East London on Wednesday night. "After the passengers had collected their luggage from the carousel, the border police members conducted random stop and search operations," he said. "When searching the suitcase of the woman, they found numerous parcels wrapped in tin foil and further examination led to the discovery of tik with an estimated street value of R5.4m, which was promptly seized." The suspect faces a charge of dealing in drugs.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
