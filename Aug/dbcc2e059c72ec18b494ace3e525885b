Both parties formed a coalition with the DA to create a multi-party government after the August 3 local government elections.ANC regional spokesperson Gift Ngqondi said having only two women in the mayoral committee was an indictment to the Constitution and to the rights of women. It was a male-dominated, white mayoral committee, he said.There are in fact three women on the committee: Lovemore, Sijadu, and Sauls.Trollip said he would apply to Eastern Cape co-operative governance and traditional affairs MEC Fikile Xasa, to establish committees with appointed chairpersons, to facilitate effective oversight of the executive.&ldquo;In the past there has been a blurring of lines of responsibility and authority between the executive, the council and the administration. This allowed for a breakdown in accountability, which in turn led to an overbearing dominance of the executive,&rdquo; he said.Trollip said the new administration planned to secure considerable savings through the trimming of a &ldquo;bloated bureaucracy of political appointments&rdquo;. Some of the savings would be used to fund the committees, to ensure better service delivery and accountability.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
