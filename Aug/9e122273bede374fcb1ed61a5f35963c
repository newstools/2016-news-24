Not a day goes by that we have not continued to pray for him," Victory Christian Children's Home co-founder, Charles Trombley, previously said.Malawian President Peter Mutharika recently expressed his hopes in ending sex crimes against children in the southern African nation through the introduction of tougher legislation against sex offenders.Speaking during an interview with the BBC, Mutharika claimed that his government would be taking strong action against so-called "hyenas" - sexual predators who are paid to&nbsp;have sex with&nbsp;young girls as part of a "cleansing" practice."I have instructed the Minister of Justice to start preparing a draft paper which will form a base of legistaion which will be presented before the cabinet, and then we will have new legislation governing&nbsp;some of these [cultural] practices," said Mutharika.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
