Tshidi Madia, News24Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina on Wednesday announced the members of the mayoral committee.WATCHJohannesburg &ndash; The call for a university in Ekurhuleni is no longer negotiable, the metro&rsquo;s newly elected Mayor Mzwandile Masina said on Wednesday.The city would find land for the project once an investor had been secured, he said at a council sitting in Germiston."It cannot be correct that a city which has a population bigger than that of Mpumalanga, Free State, Northern Cape, and North West provinces, historically does not have a university," he said.Masina named his mayoral committee members.Blame gameDA caucus leader Galeb Cachalia criticised Masina for blaming ANC supporters and the media for the it&rsquo;s poor showing in the August 3 local government elections."Everyone else voted for corruption in this municipality at the behest of president Zuma and his personal deployee, the honourable Masina, who now blames his fellow ANC members for not doing enough, and blames the voters for voting in what he now calls the oppressors, and blames the media for conspiring against the poor ANC."After he was sworn in last Tuesday, Masina said: "They reduced our glorious movement, the African National Congress, to a shadow of its former self." He beat Cachalia by 10 votes. EFF councillor Mampuru Mampuru asked Masina to pay close attention to housing in informal settlements. He said the ANC government had promised to get rid of shacks in areas like the Winnie Mandela informal settlement by 2014, but that nothing had happened.Committed to working with the oppositionMasina vowed to work with members of the opposition to fulfil the promises he had made to Ekurhuleni residents.He criticizsd the DA, claiming its strength was based on its ability to make threats."The 34% that voted for the DA must see for themselves what they nearly did to our city. Leave comedy aside. We want content now."Masina undertook to listen to opposing views.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
