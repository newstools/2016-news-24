"Either this week or next week, we will initiate an exchange with representatives of the armed groups, in order to clarify some points," President Faustin-Archange Touadera told local radio station Ndeke Luka."There are many weapons in the country, a lot of banditry," said Touadera, adding that in parts of the impoverished nation "people cannot go to the fields".Referring to a campaign dubbed the "DDR" (disarmament, demobilisation and social reintegration), Touadera said "the process must begin very soon".A total of 3 152 former fighters have registered in the DDR programme in the past year, a spokesperson for the UN peacekeeping mission in Central Africa said in late July.The Central African Republic descended into bloodshed between Christian and Muslim militias following a coup in March 2013 that ousted long-time leader Francois Bozize.Thousands died in the violence and more than 418 000 people remain displaced within the country. More than 480 000 refugees, a large number of whom are Muslim, have fled to neighbouring countries.Touadera was elected in a peaceful vote in February, helped by a 12 000-strong UN force. But the country has seen a resurgence of violence since mid-June.The UN Security Council on July 26 voted to task peacekeepers with supporting Touadera's government just as France prepares to end its military mission in the country, which involved nearly 2 500 French troops at its peak.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
