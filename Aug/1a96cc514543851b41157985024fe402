The 94-year-old grandmother woke up to strange sounds in the house on Friday night, police spokesperson Captain Livhuhani Hani said. The 28-year-old man grabbed her, undressed her, and told her to stop screaming before allegedly raping her. Neighbours came to her rescue after hearing her screams. The woman’s grandson told police he had met a man matching the description of the alleged rapist in the yard earlier in the evening. After an intensive search, the suspect was found allegedly wearing the same clothes he had worn during the crime. He will appear in the Frankfort Magistrate court on Monday for bail application, Hani said in a statement. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
