The private sector, on the other hand, has seen an increase in the employment figures for people with disabilities,"&nbsp;Baloyi said.He&nbsp;said the objective of the visit would also be to monitor the compliance of various institutions to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, as well as the Older Persons Act. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
