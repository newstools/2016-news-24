He was killed in a slave hunt in Madagascar and when Krotoa returned to the Dutch Colony to reclaim her status, she was declined.She was later banished to Robben Island and her children sent to Mauritius.&ldquo;Her life depicts pretty much the example of millions of women in our country, but Krotoa didn&rsquo;t wallow in self-doubt and rose to distinguish herself as a pioneer,&rdquo; said Mapisa-Nqakula.&ldquo;It is my wish that all of us, and young women in particular, make it a point to learn from this incredible resilient woman whose true account of her life was never told.&rdquo;Some protesters dressed in traditional garb stood outside the castle.They questioned why not all Krotoa&rsquo;s descendents were allowed inside, why she was being returned to the castle, and why the defence and military forces were there.Mapisa-Nqakula said there was nothing wrong with the demonstration as it was people asserting their identity and history.&ldquo;If anything, it further buttresses that which we are talking about, that we must tell the true South African story.&rdquo;What was important for her was that Krotoa&rsquo;s spirit was repatriated to a place, now a sacred ground, where she suffered pain.A process was underway to have the castle listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.President Jacob Zuma would commemorate the castle&rsquo;s anniversary on September 30.
