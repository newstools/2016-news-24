He said that in the past members of his community did not appreciate the hard work local leaders put in to develop the area."There is a time when a local leader bought a car and you gossiped that he had used your money for land claim," said Dzumeri.He said the same people who alleged that the compensation money had been misused by their leaders are now clapping hands after the land commission released the compensation.Greater Giyani Mayor Sassie Mathebula commended the community for its decision."Give your leaders time to plan, and peddling gossips will not help anyone," she said.The mayor said the community did the right thing by not sharing the R10m."You would finish the money and forget that you received it. But now with proper planning you will be able to do something that will remind the generations to come that there was a time when people were forcibly removed by the government and there came the democratic government that came to give people money as compensation," she said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
