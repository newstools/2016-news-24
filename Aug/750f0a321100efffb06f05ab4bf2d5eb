In Europe the same number of new arrivals per day could bring governments down," said the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi during a visit to camps in northern Uganda on Monday.Humanitarian emergency&nbsp;The UNHCR has received less than a third of the funding needed to cope with the humanitarian emergency compared to over two-thirds for the refugee crisis in Europe, Grandi said. "This is not right, we need to put this right," he said."Last year Europe received one million refugees. Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda each host 600 000-700 000 refugees, that's a lot of people. They deserve support," he said."This is where the refugee crisis is and this is where the international community should focus."Grandi was speaking at Pagarinya Settlement Camp in northern Uganda where more than 22 000 refugees arrived within two weeks of fighting breaking out in the South Sudanese capital, Juba.The UNHCR registers all of the South Sudanese migrants entering Uganda.The government of Uganda gives each refugee household a plot of land to cultivate and materials to build a basic shelter.Violence and hardship&nbsp;"Where else in the world could 22 000 refugees be resettled and given a plot of land so quickly after arriving?" asked Grandi. He said South Sudanese people "who have fled from the most appalling violence and hardship" were being let down by an international community that "has not upheld their responsibilities in the manner that it should".Grandi also appealed to the leaders of South Sudan to "behave responsibly"."There's fighting, tribal divisions, power struggles between individuals and leaders: this has to stop," he said, adding that during his visit he had heard multiple testimonies from survivors of violent attacks, rape, killings and abductions.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
