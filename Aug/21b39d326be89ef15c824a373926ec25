She had no right to take that child.&rdquo;Riaz Khan, for the defence, said he understood that the public wanted vengeance and retribution for his client&rsquo;s crimes, especially since she lacked remorse and had pleaded not guilty.Biological reunion&ldquo;The court shouldn&rsquo;t approach punishment in spirit of anger. The accused&rsquo;s personal circumstances have to be acknowledged,&rdquo; Khan said, referring to the accused&rsquo;s miscarriages, past abusive relationships and her and her siblings being deserted by her mother as a child.The 52-year-old kidnapper had a number of health issues and was a first time offender.Biological father Morne Nurse during sentencing proceedings told the court the accused had &ldquo;indoctrinated&rdquo; his daughter and that they did not have a relationship because of the woman&rsquo;s interference.Khan dismissed this as speculation, as well as the State&rsquo;s arguments that the woman be removed from society to allow the now 19-year-old to reconcile with her biological family.&ldquo;Removing her won&rsquo;t necessarily cause reunification,&rdquo; he argued, pointing out that the woman had been behind bars since her conviction in March.The kidnapper, who may not be named as it may lead to the victim being identified, was convicted of kidnapping, fraud and contravening the Children's Act.She maintained in her testimony that she had not been at Groote Schuur Hospital on the day Nurse was kidnapped in 1997.The woman was arrested in February 2015 after the teen's true identity came to light when the girl's biological sister Cassidy, who is four years younger, told her parents that a girl in matric at her school bore a striking resemblance to her and her parents.DNA tests later confirmed the teenager was Zephany.The kidnapper, however, said she got the baby from a woman called Sylvia, who had been giving her fertility treatment in 1997 after she had miscarried.Sylvia apparently arranged for the baby to be handed to her at the Wynberg train station without her prior knowledge, she claimed.Hlophe was expected to hand down a sentence on Monday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
