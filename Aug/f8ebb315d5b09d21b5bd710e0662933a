We are looking at a holistic approach. We are not going to name any names," he told News24 on Sunday."The docket is with the prosecutor and we are awaiting the NPA (National Prosecuting Authority) to give us further guidance."According to the Sunday Times, the provincial government paid the Carol Bouwer events management company R39m to organise the services across Mpumalanga in December 2013.The company apparently sub-contracted politically connected businessman Mabheleni Ntuli to provide infrastructure at a cost of R18m.Ntuli reportedly splashed out millions on cars and jewellery.The newspaper reported that Ntuli made a payment of R55 000 to one of President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s wives, Nompumelelo Ntuli-Zuma.Her lawyer was quoted as saying that the money was a gift and that there were many others.&nbsp;Ntuli, who confirmed he was not related to Ma Ntuli, said he was entitled to spoil himself after rendering services. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
