"The good news is that we are going to get above average rainfall - which normally means good production from our farmers," said Hove."But above average rainfall is going to bring with it floods and water logging in some areas of the region," said Hove, speaking on the sidelines of a meeting on drought-resilient agriculture in Johannesburg.To ensure farmers benefit from the rains, the UN officials said they needed to plant early to avoid the floods.But most farmers have little or no capital to buy farming inputs having been hit by two successive droughts.Their governments will struggle to bail them out with cash for seeds and fertilisers.Many of the regional economies are heavily dependent on commodities, prices for which have slumped on the international markets."If you look at Zambia, they lost something like 47% of their income because of the drop in copper [prices]... so the capacity of government is weakened," Chris Nikoi, WFP southern African director told AFP. "You take Zimbabwe for example, if the government is struggling to pay its civil servants - its ability to ensure that seeds are in the hands of rural farmers on time, obviously is going to be challenged." "The international community needs to step in and help," said Nikoi.Humanitarian agencies including the UN's OCHA last month called for $1.2bn in aid for seven drought-stricken countries in southern Africa, with Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique among the hardest-hit.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
