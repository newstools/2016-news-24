According to a statement issued by the provincial education department, an investigation into his alleged conduct was underway. The graphic video clip, which had been brought to the attention of the department, prompted Education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwana to visit the school on Thursday. "The MEC met with stakeholders, including the school governing body and the members of the Representative Council of Learners (RCL)." "MEC Dlungwana was told that the teacher is accused of having slept with many other learners. He was accused of luring them into his cottage where he was doing all these unspeakable things," the statement read. Dlungwana said that other girls had reported that they too had had sex with the teacher. "This is very devastating. From when I saw this video, I have been very heartbroken. I can imagine that parents and other learners are feeling more pain. To this end, we will make sure that we send psychologists to offer their services to learners who might need this kind of service," he said. A team had been appointed by the department to investigate the matter.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
