The creature appeared to be caught in a rope anchored to rock lobster nets, he said.Lambinon said least five ropes were entangled around the flukes and tail of the whale.&ldquo;The rope was twisted and entangled&hellip; and although the whale had minimal movement [it] kept avoiding the efforts by SAWDN to cut at the rope by diving below.&rdquo;Strong and healthyLambinon said the operation on Saturday evening became hazardous as the whale continued diving. The operation was suspended at 19:00.On Sunday Lambinon said the animal was found where it was left the previous day.
