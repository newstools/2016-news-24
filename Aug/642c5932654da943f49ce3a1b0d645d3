Dzamara, a journalist, was abducted on March 9 2015 while at a barbershop in Harare. The abduction took place two days after he called for mass action at a rally against the deteriorating state of the Zimbabwean economy.Reports said that five men stormed the barbershop and accused him of stealing a cow before they bundled him into an unmarked white twin-cab bakkie.Opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader Morgan Tsvangirai slammed the abduction, saying that&nbsp;he held Mugabe and his government responsible."We hold Mugabe and his regime responsible for this morbid and senseless act," Tswangirai was quoted as saying at the time. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
