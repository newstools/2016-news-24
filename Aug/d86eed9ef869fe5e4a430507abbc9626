The people are waiting for service delivery," he said.Sijadu said it was very exciting times."We are making history and I am very happy to be a part of it. I am sure it is going to be very challenging, but I believe [we] are up for the challenge and will make the city run and be glorious once more."Positions to be filledTrollip said it would become clear what positions had been offered as part of the negotiations in Thursday's council meeting."We haven't formed a multi-party government yet, that will only be tomorrow."In any multi-party government, when you have negotiations, you do discuss positions, but long before we even discussed positions, we met with national leadership of all the political parties at a number of meetings in Johannesburg at various venues over the past 12 days."At those discussions not once were positions mentioned. We first had to find common ground in order to sign a memorandum of understanding, which all the participating parties have signed," he said."After that MOU was signed, we have discussed positions. Those positions will be filled tomorrow when we make nominations on behalf of the Democratic Alliance to fill the positions elected tomorrow," he said.- Find everything you need to know about the 2016 Local Government Elections at our News24 Elections site, including the latest news and detailed, interactive maps for how South Africa has voted over the past 3 elections, or download the app for iOS and Android.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
