NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon said that volunteers were alerted to the 2.5m dolphin by a community member who&nbsp;came across&nbsp;the animal near the Botha Street slipway. "NSRI Jeffreys Bay duty crew were activated at the Paradise Beach Slipway,&nbsp;where members of the community were taking care of the dolphin," he said. "The dolphin was secured into a carrying canvass and moved 100m down the beach by local community members to where our sea rescue craft could safely beach, and the dolphin was&nbsp;loaded onto the sea rescue craft," Lambinon added. The dolphin was then transported to approximately one nautical mile out to sea and released."The dolphin swam away strongly&nbsp;and we are cautiously optimistic that the dolphin has survived," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
