THE South African Police Service (SAPS) Northern Cape’s Men For Change, the Women’s Network and the Employee Health and Wellness unit held a prayer service on Wednesday (27/07), dedicated to safety during the local government elections. Members attached to the SAPS provincial components and police members from the Frances Baard Cluster were in attendance. They were addressed by the deputy provincial commissioner for operations, Maj.Gen. Phiwayinkosi Mnguni, who emphasised the utmost professionalism, patience and safety for all community members and the police as a priority. After the church service, approximately 200 police officers hit the streets in the Kimberley CBD, where they performed stop-and-search operations, business visits and foot patrols. Several spot fines were issued for drinking in public and many knives and dangerous weapons were confiscated.
