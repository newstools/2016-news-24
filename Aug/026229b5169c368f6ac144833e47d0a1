Amnesty International put the death toll at 97.Oromia, an area which surrounds the capital Addis Ababa, has seen several months of protests, sparked by plans to allocate farmland in the region for development.Authorities scrapped the land scheme in January, but protests have flared again over the continued detention of opposition demonstrators. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
