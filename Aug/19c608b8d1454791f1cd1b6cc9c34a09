They were taken under review and would be discussed at length with 2015 and 2016 public submissions in September.Anti-corruption commissionAnother issue involved the establishment of an anti-corruption commission as a Chapter 9 Institution.It was made by the Institute for Accountability in Southern Africa, which wanted it to have similar legal standing as the Public Protector. The institute also suggested a reform of the Judicial Service Commission.MPs agreed that such a big issue warranted deeper discussions - and a decision couldn't be made in one sitting - and in isolation from consideration of the rest of the Constitution. It would be discussed with other submissions to be heard in September.Other public submissions discussed included the rights of homeowners to kill intruders in self-defence, the transformation of the SABC into a Chapter 9 institution, and a disapproval of the rights of inmates.The committee dismissed most submissions for either not falling under a constitutional mandate, not being specific enough, or being clearly opposed to Constitutional principles, as was the case for inmates&rsquo; rights.Existing legislation covered other dismissed submissions, such as homeowners&rsquo; rights.African Christian Democratic Party MP Steve Swart pleaded with the committee and the public to ensure that submissions were relevant and had genuine amendment suggestions when presented to Parliament.&ldquo;It's a waste of time and money otherwise,&rdquo; he said.The joint committee will reconvene next Friday, and again on September 9, for the final two meetings of the third term of 2016.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
