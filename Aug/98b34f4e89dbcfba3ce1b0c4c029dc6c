According to information they gleaned at the scene, some pupils&nbsp;had gone&nbsp;to the house -&nbsp;which is next to the school in Bhamo Avenue -&nbsp;last week and found the shopkeeper&rsquo;s body."Out of fright, the children only managed to report their findings to their teacher on Monday morning who, in turn, alerted the local neighbourhood watch," Van Reenen said.The security company was contacted and went to the house."The heavily decomposed body of the man, believed to be approximately 58 years of age, was found in his kitchen. Local community members suggest that the man was last seen towards the end of July."&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
