Watch.WATCHJohannesburg - An urgent appeal for South Africans to assist Syrian civilians in Aleppo was issued by the Gift of the Givers on Tuesday."In the last 72 hours the siege on Aleppo has been broken by opposition forces in Syria," said the aid organisation's director, Imtiaz Sooliman."Given this window of opportunity, Gift of the Givers is preparing to rush aid into the area using its own network inside Syria."Sooliman said that approximately 300 000 civilians had been affected by the siege which had been in effect since July 12 and deprived them of access to food, medical supplies and water.He said circumstances in Syria changed rapidly and that the organisation had to act decisively, while some opportunity to provide aid existed."We have no illusions as to the risks involved as the corridor is under constant bombing."An order for &euro;50 000 would be placed by Gift of the Givers on Wednesday morning as a trial run."Items are purchased in Turkey then delivered across the border into Syria. My teams then take over and deliver at the &lsquo;safest' possible time through the 'safest' possible route," explained Sooliman.Most recently, on Monday, the Al Hilal Hospital - one of two set up by Gift of the Givers in the country &ndash; came under attack."The hospital got saved, but our refugee centre attached to the hospital was struck."There were no families inside, however, at the time.Both hospitals together treat approximately 20 000 people a month. Gift of the Givers also runs mobile clinics, refugee camps, food parcel distribution and assists with sending medical personnel to other hospitals in the case of heavy bombing.Details on how to contribute are available on the organisation's website, giftofthegivers.org.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
