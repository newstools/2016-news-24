No case was made against the men who allegedly robbed a Hanover Park clinic on Monday 15 August. According to news reports five people were robbed at gunpoint in the clinic after suspects ran into the clinic. However, Philippi police spokesperson Captain Lance Goliath says footage that was shown to the police shows only one lady was robbed and a case was not made by the victim. “We are aware of the incident that occurred at the clinic but the victim did not report it at the police station. The case was reported by the management staff of Hanover Park clinic,” Goliath says. Goliath says because the victim and suspect is unknown they cannot investigate the case as thoroughly. “We will try to locate the victim of the robbery but for now we have no other information to go on except video footage. We urge the public to report any and all criminal cases and we also urge them to remain vigilant at all times,” he says.
