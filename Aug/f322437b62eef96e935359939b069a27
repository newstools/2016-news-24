Eric Aniva arrives at court in Malawi.

He said each family paid him a fee of between $4 and $7.His two wives were both present at the court house."We want him back home. We are suffering because we have no food," his 25-year-old wife Fanny told AFP."When he is around, we don't suffer because he is a man and he finds means to bring food to the house."His second wife, Sophia, said he had long abandoned the "hyena" business."Thieves and murderers get released on bail, but what is wrong with our husband?" she said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
