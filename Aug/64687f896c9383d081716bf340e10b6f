The others are Siboniso Miya, Nkanyiso Mafunda&sbquo; Siphiwe Memela, and Lyubomir Borislavov Grigorov.Issa was shot dead in his car at an intersection outside the Bedford Centre mall, in Bedfordview, early on the morning of October 12 2013.The State alleges Issa was killed because he and Krejcir argued about a R500 000 cash loan Issa had made to Krejcir for a bail application in another case.New attorneysGrant also wanted Krejcir moved to either Zonderwater or Johannesburg prison to make it easier to consult with him. He was previously moved from Zonderwater to Kokstad due to security concerns.He suggested that Johannesburg would be easiest due to the significant reduction in travel time to the court.Grant said he had been on the case for less than two days and had not had the opportunity to study any documents on the matter.&ldquo;I managed to Google the case and that is the extent of my knowledge,&rdquo; he said.Mafunda applied for new Legal Aid attorney last week following a demand from Judge Mihloti Msimeki that he either get a lawyer or represent himself. His previous lawyer, Anneline van den Heever, said she had not been paid and could not continue representing him.JP Marais told the court he would represent Mafunda, although he said that Mafunda was not keen on hiring him.Marais told the court he was not ready to continue with the trial as he had received 400 pages of court records on Tuesday afternoon. There was a "substantial volume" of cellphone data on various discs that he did not have in his possession.About 20 heavily-armed security and safety personnel were in the courtroom on Wednesday.The matter was postponed to September 7 to allow the lawyers to familiarise themselves with the case. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
