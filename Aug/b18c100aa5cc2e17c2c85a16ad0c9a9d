Banks should give poor students bursaries. Foreigners who owned shops in townships should contribute to free education, he said.The money people were giving to beggars at robots should instead be donated to the National Student Financial Aid Scheme.If only South Africans were as concerned about free education as they were about the Constitutional Court ruling involving President Jacob Zuma and his Nkandla homestead, the country would make progress, he said.SA Students Congress secretary general Mluleki Dlelanga said the greatest investment any country could make was in its youth.Government and universities should challenge civil rights group AfriForum, which she said was refusing transformation at universities."All universities must teach in English and other recognised languages used for purposes of academic support. Language must not be used as means to exclude our people for participating in the academic sector," she said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
