Candyce.Krishna AN elderly couple, who planned was to visit family in Sezela on Saturday, died after their car burst into flames. A First Street, Park Rynie resident was at his home overlooking the beach parking area in Convent Road when he heard an explosion.  “The man and a friend raced to the parking lot and saw thick smoke coming from a Hyundai i10 that was on fire,” said police spokesperson Captain Vincent Pandarum. “It was difficult to see if there were occupants in the car and both men began pelting the windows with bricks, but the intense heat of the blaze forced them to retreat.”  Umdoni fire fighters arrived at the scene and extinguished the blaze, but by then the car was totally burnt out.  Two completely burnt bodies were found in the car, one in the driver’s seat and the other was seated at the right rear. The bodies were removed to the Park Rynie state mortuary and an inquest docket was registered by Sergeant Shirley Chetty and Constable Douglas Mongi Gumede of the Scottburgh SAPS to investigate the circumstances surrounding the deaths.  It was established that the vehicle belonged to Aroomugum “George” Moodley (68), of Crossmoor, Chatsworth. It is alleged that he and his wife Kistamah “Baby” Moodley (70) left home at about 8am to visit relatives in Sezela.  “It is believed that the wife may have occupied the back seat because fishing rods were put in through the window with the butts in the front passenger side,” said Pandarum. The car was impounded by police for investigation purposes. The cause of the fire is yet to be established. The case is being investigated by the Scottburgh SAPS Detective Service­. - Supplied.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
