Four of the eight – police officers Sergeant Samuel Jantjies, 45, and Constable Hendrik Daniels, 35, along with Jennifer Claasen, 46, and Jean Pierre Wolfaard, 26, were denied bail. The other four, Densel Deon Jantjies, 35, Conrad Christopher Buys, 25, Charles Buys ,61, and Andries Buys, 38, were released on R10 000 bail. They were arrested following an armed robbery at G4S Cash Solutions’ Kimberley premises on May 6. Nkwalase said three armed men gained access to the property and tied up a security guard. They stole a firearm and an undisclosed amount of cash. When another security guard returned from a nearby shop, he found his unharmed co-worker tied up, and reported the matter. An investigation led officers to a premises belonging to the two Jantjies brothers. Nkwalase said money was recovered from different premises linked to the brothers. More than R1.4m was recovered. The case was postponed to September 29.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
