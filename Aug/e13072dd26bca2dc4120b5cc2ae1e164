They were sentenced to three years in jail, suspended for five years.In 2013, he and other Ses'khona protesters emptied buckets of faeces inside Cape Town International Airport to show their disgust at the portable toilets. They also poured excrement on the steps of the Western Cape legislature.Lili said that the IEC had accepted his nomination for the ANC's candidate list. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
