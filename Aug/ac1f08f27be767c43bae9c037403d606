"Fast-lanes" for children, the elderly and people with disabilities would also be implemented at clinics around the province to decrease long waiting times for these patients. The department also said construction plans had been approved to refurbish Bambisana Hospital in Lusikisiki. An infrastructure plan was signed on Monday and a contractor would now be appointed. Committee chairperson Mary-Ann Dunjwa said the meeting was the first of many, and MPs would continue to consult the department on its progress going forward.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
