The 34-year-old suspect stands accused of a string of housebreakings in the area. His ordeal began after he was tackled inside a house, and continued after he was rescued by police when the irate mob pulled him from the back of a police van. The community of Matsulu was woken by the sound of an angry mob in the early hours of Sunday chanting "bring us all our things you stole from our homes". “You have to show us where you stole our belongings, you always break in…today is your last day, we have caught you red handed,” said angry community member, Zodwa Mandlazi, 43.  The suspect is also a local businessman in the area. Homeowner Solomon Mabunda is credited with capturing the naked thief. “I was sleeping inside my house when the suspect broke in, I then heard him and woke up; he was naked and had a knife, but I didn’t let go until the noise alerted my neighbours and then everyone was here,” he said. Police spokesperson Sergeant Gerald Sedibe said the suspect is currently in hospital under police guard. “I can confirm that the suspect was found inside a house with a knife when a fight broke out between him and the victim. He was then assaulted by community members and is currently under police guard in hospital,” he said. Sedibe added that a case of house robbery had been opened and the suspect will appear in court as soon as he is discharged.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
