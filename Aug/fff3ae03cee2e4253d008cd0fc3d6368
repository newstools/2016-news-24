A 9-year-old child and a 34-year-old man were hit when a gunman opened fire on a block of flats at Saturday evening, police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk confirmed. The shots were fired as locals braaied in Karen Court, and children played outside their homes. The boy was shot in the thigh, while the man, who was visiting in the area, was hit in the arm. Attempted murder investigations were underway, he said. Sporadic shootings have taken place in the gang-ridden community for the past month, police told News24. The conflict involved the Hard Livings, Clever Kids, Ghettos and the Dixie Boys. "So-called peace talks between the gangs took place on Monday morning," a police source confirmed. "It’s been quiet since then. But everyone knows these agreements between them never last." Increased police patrols have been implemented, the officer added.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
