Her naked body was found slumped over a toilet.Her clothes had been stuffed into the cistern. Water from the leaking toilet is believed to have washed DNA evidence away.Police claim the duo had been angry after she had, days before her murder, left a Khayelitsha tavern with another man. This while their cousin - who police are still investigating - was making plans to marry her.Menyiwe last month said the State had proven it had circumstantial and direct evidence of the two's alleged involvement, despite defence lawyer Thabo Nogemane arguing that the State's evidence against his clients was of such poor quality that no court could accept it.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
