sentenced to between three and 15 years in prison on Thursday, despite
criticism of the case against them by international rights groups. A court
in the capital Nouakchott found the 13 – members of a group fighting hereditary
slavery in the west African country – guilty of "use of violence",
but Amnesty International has said they were falsely accused because of their
advocacy work. The thirteen
all claim they were tortured in prison in the run-up to the court case and
lawyers for the group denounced on Thursday's verdict as "a travesty of
justice". They
were arrested between June 30 and July 9 after a protest by a Nouakchott slum
community that was being forcibly relocated as the city prepared for an Arab
League summit on July 25. The
slum was home to many so-called Haratin – a "slave caste" under a
hereditary system of servitude whose members are forced to work without pay as
cattle herders and domestic servants, despite an official ban. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
