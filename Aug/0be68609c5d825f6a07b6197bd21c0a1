Yvonne Silaule, News24 CorrespondentBushbuckridge&nbsp;-&nbsp;A 35-year-old Thulamahashe resident hopes to wake up in a new municipality on Thursday, as he is sick and tired of what he describes as nepotism in his municipality.Frank Mathebula was gravely concerned about the "nepotism-filled" administration&nbsp;currently running the municipality, he told a New24 correspondent on Wednesday.He claimed senior local government officials employed people they knew."Here things are done for certain people, contrary to what the Constitution requires. The government is for everyone, regardless of their political affiliation or ideology or what they stand for, but it seems that that vital principle of the Constitution is forgotten," Mathebula said.He claimed that his bid to tender for a road tarring project earlier this year&nbsp;had simply been ignored."I own a close corporation and when I found out about a tar paving opportunity, I approached the municipality about it. The official paid no attention to my request. All he did was to ask if I am a member of the ruling party. He did not bother to even evaluate the viability of my proposal. These people are greedy and want to benefit alone and that is degrading to the ruling party," Mathebula said.Although he was an ANC member, he said the actions of municipal leaders had changed his thinking about the party dramatically."I will vote, but I should not be blamed when I change my mind on my way to the polls. I love the ANC, but the attitudes must change," he said.The Bushbuckridge municipality denied the claims of nepotism and said this was not how any municipality should conduct itself.Spokesperson Aubrey Mnisi said they adhered to supply chain management policies and practiced sound financial management."We do not practice nepotism, but instead look for bidders with relevant documentation and expertise," Mnisi said.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
