Milan - The Italian coast guard has rescued and revived a drowning kitten at a Sicilian port, after children on shore drew attention to its plight. A sailor jumped in the sea to rescue the cat, which was floating apparently lifeless in the water, as the coast guard ship entered Marsala port from a patrol mission.A video released on Friday showed crew members administering mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and massaging the kitten to remove water from its lungs, encouraging it: "Breathe, breathe. Wake up." After a few minutes, the kitten emitted a few weak "meows."A veterinarian on shore says the kitten is now in good health. He has been given a home at the Marsala maritime district office and has been named Charlie.L'emozionante VIDEO dell gattino salvato dalla Guardia costiera https://t.co/6gxdBCuR8N24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
