When the attack happened, the worker fled, and left the boy behind."The child was retrieved and rushed to hospital. He died before they arrived."What happened it awful. Our rules [on accessing the cages] are very strict. It is terribly upsetting that something like this happened, especially to a child. He was a cute boy."Human said the little victim was an orphan and lived with his uncle who works at the park."They are taking it very badly."Police spokesperson Captain Livhuhani Hani confirmed that a case of culpable homicide was under investigation."We are still busy with the initial investigation, but arrests may soon follow," she said.
