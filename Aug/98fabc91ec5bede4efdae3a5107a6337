Jason Rohde is the CEO of Geffen International Realty Franchises.He said that the next morning, he could not get the bathroom door open, and sought help. She was found dead inside the bathroom.The defence team of the father of three commissioned a private report, and claimed that a bathroom window into their unit had been left open, which they believed could have led to the crime scene being contaminated.Rohde sat very still behind his four defence lawyers, speaking only to confirm that he understood proceedings.The court heard that the Department of Home Affairs had his passports, including a valid Australian passport and a valid US visa. He would not be allowed to apply for a new one and could not go near any exit ports. There had been no fishy financial transfers from his bank account either, according to a report from the SA Reserve Bank.Bail grantedHe was granted bail of R1.1m - R100 000 cash to be paid on Tuesday, and a guarantee for the other million in a few weeks' time.When bail was granted, he shook hands with a few people on the way out.Rohde is allowed to continue talking to his colleagues in the course of running the business, but is not allowed to discuss the merits of the case. The names of the witnesses may also not be revealed.He has to report to the police at Melkbosstrand on the West Coast every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.When he returns to court on September 23, the court could decide on whether he will be allowed to go to Gauteng to be with his daughter, who is preparing for matric. If that is granted, he will have to report to the Randburg police station.Until then, he has to stay in the Western Cape. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
