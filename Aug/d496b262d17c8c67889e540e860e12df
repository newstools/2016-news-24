Durban – The ANC’s William Lekgoa Mapena was on Tuesday elected eThekwini municipality speaker, a position previously occupied by Logie Naidoo. Mapena received 131 votes to DA nominee Warren Burn’s 80. There were five spoilt votes. “I am honoured today because there are so many capable ANC councillors that the ANC could have chosen to be speaker,” he said in a short speech during the eThekwini metro’s inaugural council sitting after the August 3 elections, at Durban City Hall. He hoped he would not disappoint his predecessors, including MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube, and the ANC. “I will not be consumed by the title of this office and forget why I was elected into office. Titles are just titles. What is important is how we discharge the political responsibilities that have been given to us.” Saying a prayer, Mapena asked God to help him avoid conflicts of interest, respect other councillors, and be ethical, impartial, diligent, and honest. He urged councillors to be guided by the rule of law, deliver services to the people more efficiently and effectively, and prepare Durban to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games. Voting for the mayor, deputy mayor, and chief whip then took place. The ANC nominated Zandile Gumede as mayor. The DA, in a surprise move, ditched its mayoral candidate Haniff Hoosen, and nominated Zwakele Mncwango instead.
