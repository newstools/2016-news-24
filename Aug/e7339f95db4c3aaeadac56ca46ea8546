The whole thing is with Besigye because of his lawlessness and indiscipline," he told reporters at a press briefing.Museveni claimed that&nbsp;"beating" was an acceptable method of crowd control during illegal demonstrations. Images were being circulated online showing some of the violence.He distanced himself from the use of long sticks to disperse crowds, insisting instead that "baton charge" would be a better course of action.Wandera Ogalo, a lawyer with the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC), condemned Museveni's criticism of Besigye. He said Museveni should remain aware of the fact that "people see Dr Besigye as their president"."The president is trying to blame the victim, yet the stick-wielding goons in police who beat Ugandans like cows are known," Ogalo was quoted as saying in the&nbsp;Daily Monitor.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
