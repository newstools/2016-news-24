Durban - A fourth suspect wanted in connection with the murder of a Morningside businessman has been arrested by a team of investigators on Tuesday, KwaZulu Natal police said. Members of Magma Security and Investigations and the Durban K9 unit were following up leads on the suspect in the Nodwengeni, Applebosch area, where the suspect was hiding, Captain Nqobile Gwala said. Hoosen Dhoda was killed last week when gunmen stormed into the travel agency with the intention of robbing it. "During the course of the robbery there was a shooting incident and an elderly man, Hoosen Dhoda, was killed," Magma's Shaheen Sulieman said. The three other suspects were arrested on Friday last week.
