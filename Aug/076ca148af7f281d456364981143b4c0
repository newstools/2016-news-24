Of those, at least 25 died on the night of the arrest, while a further 45 were transferred to an alternate facility the next day.In addition, operatives are said to have unlawfully killed approximately nine civilians during the operation, while destroying more than 70 homes.Amnesty confirmed that it suspected the victims to have gone missing through enforced disappearance, which was deemed a crime under international law.The organisation has since relayed a complete list of names to Cameroon's minister of justice, minister of defense and military head in the north of the country. The families of those missing, however, have yet to receive any correspondence on the matter."The authorities must conduct a thorough and impartial investigation into what happened in Magdeme and Doubl&eacute;, and ensure that those responsible are brought to justice. They must also provide full and effective reparation to the families of the victims,&rdquo; Tine stated. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
