Nothing could be further from the truth. The youth league believes in a generational mix to reflect both an appreciation for institutional memory and the reality that the future belongs to young people.&rdquo;No succession debateSabelo said the youth league was aware of the ANC's processes and would not be drawn into succession debates yet.&nbsp;&ldquo;When the time is right the youth league will support the decision of the NEC to lobby for a female president to lead a collective which shall feature prominently younger leaders of the ANC.&rdquo;At a press briefing on Thursday, Sabelo challenged people to prove claims that the league had called for Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to be elected ANC president.&ldquo;We called for a woman president and I said that the ANCYL nationally has called for a female president.&ldquo;The media must have assumed that just because we were campaigning with Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, that we implied that she must be the next president.&rdquo;The league however believed she had the capacity to do the job. There were other women who would also be suitable, like former ANCYL secretary general Vuyiswa Tulelo.He said a &ldquo;generational mix&rdquo; was needed in the ANC&rsquo;s top six leadership structure, which was currently not the case.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
