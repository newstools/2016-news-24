They will then be shipped to the US and transported to the ISS for launch in January next year.Herman Steyn, head of the project and founder of CubeSpace, said they were asked to supply 15 control units to other satellites."They're therefore helping out where other participants don't have enough experience in satellite control systems. It's a huge challenge to keep a satellite within 10&deg; of the orbiting direction."The funding for these control units helped sponsor ZA-Aerosat.Steyn said the satellite would also be used to demonstrate the aerodynamic stabilisation of a satellite in practical terms for the first time.WATCH this video:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
