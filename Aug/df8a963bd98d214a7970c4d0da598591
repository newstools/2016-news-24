Transport MEC Mxolisi Kaunda in a statement commended the Park Rynie's&nbsp; Department of Transport&rsquo;s Road Traffic Inspectorate team&nbsp; for arresting Ivan Botha, 28, on August 14, for speeding in a Golf 6 GTI at 220km/h on the N2 national road.&nbsp; Kaunda said in a statement that Botha&nbsp;had been&nbsp;held in custody at the Scottburgh police station.&nbsp; "The Scottburgh&rsquo;s magistrate today [Monday] handed down a fine of R18 000," said Kaunda. "[This] should be a great lesson to all who endanger our lives.&nbsp;Speedsters are like murderers, because at any moment their actions could lead to devastating consequences, including death and maiming of other road users.&nbsp; "More so, we commend the great work of the department&rsquo;s Road Traffic Inspectorate team in the Park Rynie station, who always catch speedsters travelling to the South Coast.&nbsp; It is high time all road users, especially motorists, started taking our call for road safety seriously, and realise that it&rsquo;s about life and death," said Kaunda. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
