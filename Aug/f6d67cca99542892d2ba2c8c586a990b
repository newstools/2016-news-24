According to New Zimbabwe, Mawarire believed that too many people who had been fighting against President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s regime had already died in the country. As a result, he did not want to become another "hero".&nbsp;The 39-year-old cleric apologised for his decision, but insisted that he made his decision after being warned by government officials on a number of occasions.&nbsp;"I'm sorry if what I have said or done has upset you..." @PastorEvanLive full video on https://t.co/KA8UtgwUgJ pic.twitter.com/yYWAVVfYWd&mdash; #ThisFlag (@ThisFlag1980) August 16, 2016"I'm sorry if what I have said or done has upset you..." @PastorEvanLive full video on https://t.co/KA8UtgwUgJ pic.twitter.com/yYWAVVfYWdMawarire further claimed that he feared for his life and that of his family. "Right now I am terrified for my life and lives of my family. We have lost enough people in Zimbabwe. I don&rsquo;t want to be another martyr. I want to help rebuild my country," Mawarire was quoted as saying.Recent reports indicated that Mawarire was travelling to the US to meet compatriots and consider his next move.But, his self imposed exile to the US has caused a social media uproar, with some labelling him a coward who abandoned his countrymen and sought refuge in foreign lands.Pastor Mawarire is off to the US?
