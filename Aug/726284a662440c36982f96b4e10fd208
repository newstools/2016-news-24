of 15-month-old twin girls found in a hot car in west Georgia. News
outlets report Asa North of Carrollton was arrested early on Friday. Online
jail records show North is charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter
and two counts of reckless conduct. Carrollton
police say someone discovered the twins unresponsive in the back seat of an SUV
parked in front of a duplex on Thursday night. Arriving
officers found people holding the girls in a nearby baby pool, trying to cool
the children off. Some had ice packs. The
twins were taken to a hospital, where they were pronounced dead. Police
said the mother was in Atlanta at the time. It isn't
immediately clear if North has an attorney. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
