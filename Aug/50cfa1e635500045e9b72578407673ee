They have been fantastic.&rdquo;Swales said Gous and Da Rosa were both passionate and dedicated. The dogs they work with, Chas and Bear &mdash; who was formerly Lieutenant Jack Haskins&rsquo;s dog &mdash; are brothers who were reunited on the search.&ldquo;If all police were like Karl and Romel, there would be no problems in this country. It is just staggering to see how much they have done. It has been unbelievable.&rdquo;Swales said despite the family&rsquo;s grief, they wanted to try and channel their energy into doing something positive.&ldquo;We want Brenda&rsquo;s legacy to continue, so we decided to create an non-profit organisation that would fund the K9 units in the police and in private security companies.&ldquo;Five years on, maybe we will look back on this and be sad, but also look fondly on the catalyst we started.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
