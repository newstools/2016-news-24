appointed the new SA Police Service Commissioner of Gauteng, the office of
Premier David Makhura has announced. Makhura welcomed her appointment, stating that she had over
30 years of police experience. “We wish to congratulate and welcome Major General De Lange
in her new and demanding role. We are confident that she brings a wealth of
experience with her to help us fight crime and build a safer Gauteng,” said
Makhura. De Lange, who joined the SA Police Service at the age of 22,
is the first female provincial commissioner to be appointed in Gauteng. According to the premier's office, she rose through the
ranks from a trainer at the police college to a station commander, a cluster
leader; and most recently the deputy provincial commissioner for human resource
management in the province. She has held the position of deputy provincial commissioner
since February 2015. Makhura said her appointment is welcomed as it addressed the
concerns he raised during the State of the Province Address about instability
in the leadership of the police brought about by the lack of a permanent
appointment in this position. De Lange takes over from Major General Eric Nkuna, who was
appointed acting commissioner last month. De Lange's appointment was announced late on Wednesday evening. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
