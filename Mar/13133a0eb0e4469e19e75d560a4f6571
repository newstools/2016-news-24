Lynn.HitchcockAHEARTBROKEN mother of four is struggling to raise her triplets and son. Veliswa Buma (38) of Mabulabula village, outside Matatiele, was happy when she received news from nurses that she was carrying three babies, however, things didn t turn out the way she thought they would when she gave birth in November 2013. "My boyfriend left me after I gave birth. He promised to marry me, but after I gave birth he went with other women and left me. I asked him for child support, but he threatened to kill me and my children just to get peace, Buma is asking for help to raise her triplets, including her seven-year-old son. "I depend on a child support grant for three children, however, the money is not enough to feed them. I have to hire a helper when I take them to the clinic." The unemployed Buma told Fever she used to do part-time work in Matatiele, but stopped to take care of her children. "I can't work because I do not have a helper. To leave my children with relatives doesn t help me because I have to pay for that as well. I even considered taking them to people who don't have children, but my neighbours advised me not to think about that because God has given them to me for a purpose." Matatiele Local Municipality mayor Momelezi Mbedla said: "I was not aware of the women's situation. Our ward councilors and municipality officials will do an assessment to see a way forward." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
