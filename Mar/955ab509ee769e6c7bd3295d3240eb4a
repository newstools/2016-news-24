Cape Town – A woman may have been convicted of snatching newborn Zephany Nurse many years ago, but nobody wins at the end of the day, her biological mother told Heart FM this week. “In a certain way I think justice has prevailed, but like I mentioned before, for me it hasn’t done anything because I have still lost the years with my daughter,” Celeste Nurse told host Aden Thomas in an emotional conversation broadcast on Tuesday morning. “There is no special bond between the two of us, so for me it’s like it’s all for nothing.” The Western Cape High Court last week convicted a 51-year-old woman of kidnapping, fraud, and contravening the Children’s Act. She was expected to be sentenced at the end of May. In a soft voice, the mother said there were no winners in a case like this. “Everybody loses. So nobody is happy at the end of this whole situation. Everybody is heartbroken. There is emotion. It is actually like the 18 years is starting now.” She felt things would have been different if the woman had come clean and revealed what happened all those years ago. “But I do feel sorry for her because what she is facing now... she doesn’t know what is awaiting her.” They had heard the woman had a history of miscarriages and abuse in previous relationships. “So for me to judge her, I have got no right to do that. I don’t know what this woman has been through, how her life has been.” She told Thomas it would be enough if the woman opened up to her. At the moment, she did not have closure and felt incomplete. She had waited 17 years, and would wait at least 10 years more, for a proper relationship with Zephany Nurse. “It could be the next 15 years or the day when she starts having a family, but I will wait as long as it takes. I am not going to push my daughter. I am going to wait up until she decides to come and say: 'Mommy, I am ready. How are we going to go from here?'" Listen to Celeste speak here:
