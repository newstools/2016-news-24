The students had been protesting over the shortage of lecturers when police were called in to restore calm. Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson Mthokozisi Ngobese said about 200 students at Plessislaer Campus, in Imbali, embarked on an illegal strike. He said when police came to the campus, students had chained the entrance gate with a lock that does not belong to the institution. “Police had to enter the campus by force after the students refused to open the gate. Police then pleaded with the students to stop what they were doing, but they continued to damage motor vehicles,” he said. Ngobese said police were forced to fire rubber bullets after the students had failed to disperse even after police had used tear gas and fired stun grenades. “No arrests were made. However, cases of public violence and malicious damage to property were opened,” he said. SRC member Sibusiso Ndlovu said 11 students had to go to hospital after they were injured. “We were just protesting peacefully, but police came in and started firing rubber bullets.” Ndlovu claimed the institution did not have enough lecturers.
