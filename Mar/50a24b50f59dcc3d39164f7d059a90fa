You're a cruel grandfather who actually took advantage of your wife's absence and raped your own granddaughter. Instead of protecting the victim, you turned into a beast and raped her," Malunga ruled.The development follows on from a report by The Zimbabwean,&nbsp;in which a man was found guilty of impregnating his 15-year-old daughter last year.According to the report, the man, a 44-year-old resident of Gokwe district, made his way into his daughter's bed at night, raped her and threatened to kill her if she revealed the details to anyone.The man's wife, however, came&nbsp;out in support of her husband's incest, saying she did not want action to be taken against him&nbsp;regarding the&nbsp;matter.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
