And then a PhD.Moonsamy said women often found themselves sidelined into the stereotype of carer, to the detriment of their careers. And she took umbrage to what she felt was the government's patriarchal approach to women in South Africa.She said the women's ministry was reduced to a desk in the presidency, and believed the Commission for Gender Equality is "almost defunct".So women have to start from scratch again. And to make the changes that need to be made, they need the skills. Moonsamy urged women to go out and get skills so that as more opportunities become available, they would be ready.And they also need to support each other while they are doing it. "We need unity among women. Sometimes we are so busy building ourselves that we tend to step on each other."The legal fraternity is dominated by men. Change is coming, and we must prepare ourselves as women to implement the change,'' she said.EFF supportiveIt was not clear yet whether she will return as an MP because of the workload of preparing her dissertation for her Master's degree.The party was very supportive of her when she asked to go and complete her articles. She said she has been through thick and thin with most of its senior members &ndash; from their end days at the African National Congress Youth League to starting the EFF from scratch while they were being ridiculed.Well known lawyer Dali Mpofu SC, the party's chairperson, was among the people who congratulated her in February.So the EFF would probably understand if she needed a bit more time to sharpen her skills and to decide whether she will be bringing that change in Parliament or the courtroom.Ward 40 funzo primary school mamelodi, Tswane pic.twitter.com/J4k22EAg4Y&mdash; Magdalene (@MaggieMoonsamy) March 6, 2016Ward 40 funzo primary school mamelodi, Tswane pic.twitter.com/J4k22EAg4Y24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
