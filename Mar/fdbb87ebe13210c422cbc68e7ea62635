Thulani Gqirana and Jenni Evans, News24Parliament &ndash; &nbsp;The bid to appoint a new inspector general of intelligence (IGI) has been revived in Parliament. Last year, after gruelling interviews, Parliament&rsquo;s intelligence committee recommended Cecil Burgess for the post. From the start of the shortlisting process, Burgess was seen as the front runner for the position. The National Assembly was expected to confirm Burgess&rsquo;s nomination in June. But the process lapsed when, at the last moment, the ANC asked for the matter to be postponed, reportedly because the party realised the nomination would fail when put to the vote.&nbsp; On Thursday, MPs in the National Assembly agreed to reopen the matter.DA Chief Whip John Steenhuisen's request to make a declaration was turned down. The previous IGI was Faith Radebe whose term ended at the end of March 2015. She stayed on until last May. Burgess was at the forefront of pushing through the Protection of State Information Bill when he chaired an ad hoc committee on what was also dubbed the "secrecy bill". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
