The author, a professor at UCLA in California, vowed he would use his year at the College de France to highlight African writing and give it its proper place in the pantheon of French letters."Some think still that Africans don't have literature like some think that Africa has not entered history," he said, referring to a controversial speech by former French president Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007."That is not true," he said, "We have no need to enter into history, we are history. The history of France was also stitched by its black sons... France is not really a white Judeo-Christian country," he said, taking up equally hotly disputed remarks by one of Sarkozy's former ministers.While English literature has embraced its global diversity, he argued, France has been slow to do so. "French is not just spoken along the Seine or in Cafe de Flore", the one-time Parisian watering hole of writers and philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, he said."The French language is also the crackle of Abidjan, of all that happens in Dakar.... It is that multicoloured, rainbow French that I look for," he said.The College de France is a uniquely French institution where any member of the public can attend lectures given by acknowledged experts in their fields on a variety of subjects including medicine, law and mathematics.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
