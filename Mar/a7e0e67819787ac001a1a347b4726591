Jeff Wicks, News24Durban - An Alberton man who was struck by lightning while on a romantic mountain getaway with his wife is expected to be moved to a regular ward soon. Eric McKechnie, 57, has been in a high care unit at the Netcare Sunninghill Hospital following the strike on Monday. His wife Gwen told News24 that they had been taking a scenic drive in Bergville in the foothills of the Drakensberg mountains in KwaZulu-Natal for their 24th wedding anniversary. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"We saw rays of sunlight coming through the clouds and he pulled off the road to take a picture. "[Eric] got out and I heard this huge bang and when I looked he was laying in the middle of the road," Gwen McKechnie said. &nbsp;She said that the lightning had been conducted by a gold chain her husband had worn around his neck. "The chain was blown to pieces and I only have two links which were all that was left. For some reason he had taken his watch off before getting out of the car and if he hadn't his injuries could have been way worse," she said."I just started praying and asked God for help and I started doing CPR. A car came by and a nurse stopped and she helped me."Her husband was then revived and actually walked himself to his car.&nbsp;ER24 spokesperson Werner Vermaak said at the time that the nurse was in a taxi that had stopped to help the couple.&nbsp;As CPR was being performed, the passengers started singing and praying around the injured man.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
