lion that escaped from the Karoo National Park, the South African National
Parks (SANParks) said on Monday. SANParks spokesperson Reynold Thakuli said a search team
had been deployed to track the cat. “An electronic collar indicated that the lion was outside
the national park,” said Thakuli. He said it was the same one that had escaped in 2015. Last year, the lion which was said to be 3-years-old
escaped through a hole that formed under the fence after a heavy flow of water. The hole was underneath the fence on the western side of
the park, next to Fraserburg Road, and the suspicion was that the lion made its
way through a stormwater pipe to one of the farms in the area. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
