Three alleged thieves were arrested in Camperdown over the weekend and two others in Rustenburg on Monday.The arrests follow collaborative investigations between the police, the Hawks and other law enforcement agencies to clamp down on criminals who are stealing electricity cables and other steel components.In Camperdown, thieves were targeting electricity transformers for their oil and copper content, while in Rustenburg, they had stolen vast numbers of aluminium overhead conductors. The two thieves in Rustenburg were caught in the act whilst trying to steal an aluminium conductor that Eskom security had used as bait. Eskom said in a statement yesterday that last month a Kroonstad court in the northern Free State sentenced a cable theft syndicate to 140 years behind bars on charges of theft and contravention of the Organised Crime Act. &ldquo;We are taking steps to combat cable theft in collaboration with the joint industry working group formed by Eskom, Transnet, Telkom, the police, the National Prosecuting Authority, Business Against Crime and the South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry,&rdquo; Eskom&rsquo;s statement said.Eskom urged the public to support Operation Khanyisa &mdash; a national partnership aimed at fighting electricity theft, by reporting electricity theft to their Crime Line by sending anonymous tip-offs via SMS to 32211.&mdash; Witness Reporter. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
