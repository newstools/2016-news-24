"Included in these contraventions are two cases of corruption and eight cases of fraud, including evidence of falsification of documents in some instances," said James Styan, spokesperson for departmental MEC Anton Bredell. The contraventions mostly pertained to the Municipal Finance Management Act, as well as municipal policies and legislation. Bredell was handed the final report, consisting of eight lever arch files, after the investigation was launched last year. The municipality was placed under administration in July 2015. Styan said Bredell would appoint a task team to assess the report and advise on the procedures to follow, especially relating to criminal proceedings. "The report also calls for disciplinary action against individuals. This process has already been initiated. This matter will be followed through to the end. The people of Oudtshoorn deserve no less." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
