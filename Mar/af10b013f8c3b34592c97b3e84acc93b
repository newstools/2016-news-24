The employee, based at Gallows Hill in Green Point, allegedly drove away when an officer tried to stop his white VW Jetta for driving without his headlights on, at a roadblock over the weekend, council said in a statement. During the ensuing high-speed chase along Voortrekker Road, the Jetta driver allegedly tried to run the officer off the road several times. “Near the Kuils River police station, the vehicle stopped and two young women jumped out before the driver sped off again, but he misjudged and hit a kerbed centre median, blowing out two of the tyres,” the city said. It was suspected that the women were prostitutes. The driver was arrested for drunk driving, but allegedly refused to provide the officer with a breath sample. He was also charged with reckless or negligent driving, and intimidation, for allegedly threatening the arresting officer’s family. Mayoral committee member for safety and security JP Smith said while the behaviour of some road users was despicable judging from the city’s weekly arrests, it was even more distasteful when one of those arrested was meant to uphold the law. “This conduct is appalling and shocking. I am ashamed,” he told News24. The officer should be suspended before the end of the week, Smith said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
