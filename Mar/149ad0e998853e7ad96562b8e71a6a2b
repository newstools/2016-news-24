Traders came from southern Nigeria as well as West and Central African nations."This clampdown has affected thousands of truck drivers, loaders, butchers, even water sellers ... the consequences will be devastating," Abdullah warned, saying his organisation has 12 000 members and the butchers' more than 200 000.A senior military officer said butchers and traders were involved in "shady deals" with Boko Haram. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to reporters.Resident Abubakar Maina, who has not eaten meat for days, said the military should target suspects, not punish everybody.Beef is a major source of protein in Nigeria. In Maiduguri, those who can afford it are buying fresh and frozen fish at inflated prices. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
