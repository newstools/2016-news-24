Boipelo.Mere THE Siyathemba Municipality warns the public against a man who is allegedly using the names of three of its traffic officers, Franklin Louw, Selwyn Bosch and George Sobhuza, to collect money from people in a dishonest way. The man poses as one of these men and charges people a fee, promising that he will ensure they receive learner and driving licences. According to Johann Badenhorst, corporate services manager, several people have already fallen for this scam and paid money into the scammerâ€™s personal account, after which the promises were not met. The municipality and the three traffic officials in question have distanced themselves from the scam and do not accept any responsibility for any loss that people may have suffered, says Badenhorst. He urges that all applications for licences be made at the Traffic Department and fees paid directly to the municipality. He requested that applicants call the municipality on 053-353-5300 or the traffic division on 053-353-5322.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
