An impassioned &nbsp;Busisiwe Seabe told Madonsela she was policing fellow student Simamkele Dlakavu who was part of the panel in her answers to a white student in attendance."Even you, advocate, the way you are chairing the session and policing Simamkele's response to this white woman, you are trying to protect the white privilege that she has, to sit back and say things that she says... "We didn't step into a democracy, all we stepped into was the master allowing us to not stand outside and work in a plantation. But now we can come in and wash his dishes as well," the student said.Madonsela then said she was not protecting the white woman but she knew they would agree if they had a broader discussion. Madonsela said even during apartheid she was never excluded because of money or slept in toilets while she attended university."I am appealing to young people don't assume if someone is white they are on the other side."Veteran lawyer George Bizos, who was also in attendance, said he expected a little bit more optimism about the future from students. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
