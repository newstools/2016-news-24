Pretoria - A Johannesburg traffic officer was arrested
for taking a bribe in Soweto, the Road Traffic Management Corporation said on
Sunday. Spokesperson Simon Zwane said the officer was caught in
Dobsonville, Soweto where she was conducting a law enforcement operation. "The officer allegedly stopped an undercover agent
of the National Ant-Corruption Unit for driving an unroadworthy vehicle. She
demanded a R100 bribe instead of removing the disc and discontinuing the
vehicle," said Zwane. He said the Hawks were called to the scene and the
officer was immediately arrested. A cash sum of R1 280 was found in her possession. "A case of corruption was opened at Dobsonville
police station. The officer is expected to make a first appearance at
Roodepoort Magistrate's Court on Tuesday," said Zwane. She was the second officer to be arrested in a space of
two days for soliciting a bribe from a motorist. On Saturday a Randfontein
municipal traffic officer was arrested on a similar charge on the R28 in the
West Rand. The officer was operating a speed trap when he stopped an
undercover member of the National Traffic Anti-Corruption Unit for speeding. The officer also demanded a R100 bribe from the
undercover official. He was found in possession of R4 000.
