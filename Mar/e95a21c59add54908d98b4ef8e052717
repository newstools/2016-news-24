Whispering as court was in session, he said his son was discharged on Monday evening.While waiting for the matter to be heard, a young woman was led up from the cells to the courtroom. Stabbing a finger in the air, Gerald sat up straight and whispered furiously: "Daai is die meisie wat hom gevat het!" (That is the girl who took him).On Monday, the newborn's grandmother, Segria Pieterse, 53, said a young woman in the ward had introduced herself to her (Pieterse's) son and daughter-in-law.&ldquo;She said she loves the baby because he is very beautiful. She kept on staring at him,&rdquo; the granny said in Afrikaans.Her son left the hospital around 20:00. It was then that the woman apparently asked her daughter-in-law if she could take the baby to show him to her mother across the way.&ldquo;She told her no she can&rsquo;t. Everything happened so quick. The baby was there and the next moment he was gone.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
