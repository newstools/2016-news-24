Ban recently visited Saharan refugee camps and referred to Morocco's "occupation" of Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony that Morocco annexed in 1975. Morocco regarded the term as an insult.Moroccans held a huge protest on Sunday over the comments, organized by the country's leading political parties, labour unions and NGOs. The next day, on the orders of Moroccan King Mohammed VI, Foreign Minister Salaheddine Mezouar went to the UN to meet with Ban, asking him to "publicly clarify" his position, the Foreign Ministry said.Ban's spokesperson said the UN chief considers the attacks "disrespectful to him and to the United Nations." He renewed a call for resumed peace negotiations.Morocco remains angry, and late on Tuesday the Foreign Ministry announced a reduction of its staff in the MINURSO peacekeeping mission and an end to the "voluntary contribution Morocco has accorded to the maintenance of MINURSO." Moroccan funding will not, "for the moment," be affected, according to Foreign Ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to comment on the issue.The status of the Western Sahara is among the most sensitive topics in the North African kingdom.

Mohamed Sidati, the group's delegate minister for Europe, said in a statement carried on its official news agency, Sahara Press Service, that the Moroccan move is a "sign of panic."Eric Goldstein, Human Rights Watch's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, said that the anti-MINURSO measures "can only undermine Morocco's international standing."He noted a series of past actions taken by Morocco to affirm what it considers its sovereignty over Western Sahara. Most recently, Morocco suspended contacts with the European Union after a December ruling by the European Court of Justice annulling a fisheries and agriculture agreement between Morocco and the EU because it included Western Sahara territory.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
