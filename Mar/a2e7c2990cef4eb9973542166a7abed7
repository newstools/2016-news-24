Police had also not yet given any feedback to Mafevuka's family and they were yet to receive counselling.This after Mafevuka was found half naked in a communal toilet.Sotyu received a briefing from the Khayelitsha Cluster on Thursday, where she demanded to know what was happening with the case.&ldquo;You told me the media was lying," said Sotyu, in reference to the police. "But they were not. There is no case whatsoever. The family don&rsquo;t know anything about the police. They know what is happening in Tokai, but they know nothing about the death of their own child. &ldquo;You need to take it up with whoever has been telling you the family has been briefed. The last time they saw the police was when the body was discovered.&rdquo;Meanwhile, Khayelitsha cluster commander Major General Johan Brand said the police were doing everything they could to find the person who killed&nbsp;Mafevuka.Brand was raked over the coals by Sotyu on Thursday for the "shoddy police work"."I can say we are at an advanced stage of the forensic evidence that was collected at the crime scene, and we are trying to connect suspects at this stage."I am very confident that arrests will be made soon in this case," he said.Brand said it was unacceptable that police hadn't given the case the attention it deserved.He said they would deal with the fact that police did not give "proper feedback".He said Khayelitsha was difficult to police, as the distances between the settlements and the toilets were substantial.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
