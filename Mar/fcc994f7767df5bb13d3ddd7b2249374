Work has started on the first of a series of boreholes and dedicated R1m toward drilling in KwaZulu-Natal."By the end of this week, we anticipate water will come out."MP Mandla Mandela, representing the Nelson Mandela Foundation, said he knew about the reality of not being able to open a tap for a glass of water."I am from a village in the Eastern Cape and my very own household has no access to clean, drinkable water. We know what a five litres means. It can make a difference," he said.Government was looking at building a dam to allow better access to water in the Eastern Cape as a long-term solution, Mandela added.PredictedCape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille said the drought was predicted a decade before becoming a reality."If only we had listened 10 years ago and had started saving water, then we would have not been in this crisis we are in now."You can only save water when you have it."Cape Town wastage was the lowest in the country, at 15%, while some drought-stricken areas are as high as 40%, she said."I monitor the dams of Cape Town very closely. A month ago we were on 42.9%. Today we are only on 40.5%."The mayor has advised city residents to "stop singing... in the shower" and rather "get in and get done," and also to close taps while brushing their teeth.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
