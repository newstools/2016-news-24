Iavan Pijoos, News24  Port Elizabeth - A child rapist was rearrested after he escaped from St Albans prison in Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape correctional services said on Tuesday. “After 19:00pm last night, we received a tip-off that the escaped rapist was hiding in the bushes 10km from the St Albans prison,” area commissioner Mandla Jam said. Police and correctional services searched the area and arrested Sicelo Tshamlambo later that evening. He escaped earlier on Monday. He was sentenced to life for raping a 13-year-old girl in East London in 2007. Jam said he changed from his orange prison clothes into casual wear and had started hitch-hiking towards Rocklands. He would be charged with escaping from custody and appear in court soon.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
