 WATER restrictions to be applied with immediate effect were approved by a majority during a sitting of the eThekwini full council on Wednesday, 24 February.   “In terms of the decision, both domestic and industrial use has to be reduced by 15% and irrigation by 50% of the annual target draft. Consumers who do not comply with water restrictions will, following a written warning, be issued with a fine in accordance with clause 11(1)(b) of the eThekwini water by-laws which is R500 for domestic consumers and R10 000 for large businesses,” Cllr Andre Beetge said.
