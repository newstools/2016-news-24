Amanda Khoza, News24Durban &ndash; KwaZulu-Natal royal household spokesperson Prince Thulani Zulu became a victim of identity theft after someone hacked into his e-mail account and asked his contacts for money.Zulu told News24 that on Wednesday morning he received a call from his general manager Christopher Nxumalo, from the premier&rsquo;s office, asking him if he was alright. He was surprised when Nxumalo told him he had received an e-mail from him asking for a R4000 loan after he was robbed. The e-mail from Zulu's private Gmail account read: &ldquo;I am away to North West for a seminar and was mugged last night by some hoodlums. My bag got stolen with my phone and bank card in it. Can I get a loan of R4 000 from you to sort out some immediate things which includes my transportation back home as well. You will have it as soon as I get back. It is really urgent.&rdquo; Zulu said his account was hacked. &ldquo;The e-mail has been sent to all my contacts and I have even received phone calls from people in Britain asking how can they help me. This person is asking people to send him money through the Money Market using my ID number. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how he got my ID number and I am worried that he will use my ID to access other private stuff. I went to the police to report him and they are trying to track the suspect.&rdquo; Zulu said the account was blocked and he urged people not to respond to the e-mail. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Nqobile Gwala said Nongoma police were investigating. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
