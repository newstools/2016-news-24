	     Harare - Zimbabwe's embassy buildings in Botswana and Ethiopia are set to get a facelift soon, Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa has said, following reports that they are in a "deplorable" state.  According to the state-owned Herald newspaper, Mnangagwa said government would start with upgrades at the embassy building in Ethiopia, which reportedly has leaking roofs.  Reports on Wednesday indicated that the embassy buildings in the two African countries were in deplorable and uninhabitable conditions.  Foreign Affairs Parliament Committee chairperson Kindness Paradza told parliament that they were left shocked after discovering the buildings' "deplorable" state during a recent visit to the two countries. However, following lengthy deliberations on the matter, Mnangagwa told parliament that they were dealing with the situation.  He also admitted that the country was having problems with the maintenance of its embassies.  "There are indeed problems of administration and maintenance of embassies. However and unfortunately, this afternoon [Wednesday] we were seized with the state of the affairs of our embassies in cabinet. We resolved to start with Ethiopia so that we change the face of it…," Mnangagwa was cited as saying.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
