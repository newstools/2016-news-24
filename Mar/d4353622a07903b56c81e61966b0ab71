The man, Stanford Wallick, was alleged to have raped the girl on the night of January 27 while she was outside her parents' home. According to a Malawi24 report, the 16-year-old girl was on her way to use the bathroom when Wallick dragged her to his residence and raped her. During his appearance in court, Wallick pleaded guilty to a charge of rape, but begged for a lesser sentence, claiming that he was in a relationship with the girl. While handing down sentence, presiding Magistrate Emulani Phiri said that cases of rape were on the increase in the area and that the nine-year sentence would deter would-be offenders from committing such crimes. The development came a few weeks after reports of a Kasungu man who held a secondary school student hostage and raped her repeatedly over a five-hour period. According to the Nyasa Times, 21-year-old Chikwamao Mambo allegedly abducted the 17-year-old girl on February 14 before locking her in a room and sexually abusing her repeatedly.       24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
