	     Pietermaritzburg - A man and the hitman he hired to murder his "intolerable" father were sentenced to lengthy jail terms on Wednesday. The hitman was offered R30 000 to stab Ashrab Mohideen, 57 to death at his home in February. Mohideen's son, Jibraeel Mohideen, 34, told the court that his father had made his life intolerable, but Judge Rishi Seegobin told him that he could have left his father's business and home instead of resorting to murder. Mohideen was jailed for 20 years and hitman Joshua Mtshali for 25 years. Both pleaded guilty. Seegobin said it was a tragic reflection on society that there were many people who were prepared to kill for money. Jibraeel Mohideen said that his father made him work without pay and would not allow him to live with his wife. He said his father would also rebuff and belittle any suggestions he made and was hard on Jibraeel's sister. Prosecutor Candy Kandar said she was constrained to agree with defence counsel Ishy Khan that there were substantial and compelling circumstances which allowed the court to deviate from the prescribed life in jail sentences in both cases. These circumstances included Jibraeel Mohideen's living and working conditions as well as that both had admitted their guilt and were prepared to assist police in the investigation. Their guilty pleas had indicated their remorse, she said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
