	     Cape Town - It is suspected that the propeller of a big boat may have struck the Southern Right whale which washed up at Holbaai near Melkbosstrand on Friday morning. Wayne Dyason of the City of Cape Town’s marine unit said the carcass has some deep cuts. The solid waste department was currently recovering the 10m-long whale. "It will then be taken to the nearby Kreeftebaai, adjacent to Melkbos. A sample will then be taken from the carcass for analysis and the carcass will then be taken to Vissershok landfill site for disposal," Dyason said. The carcass was discovered by early morning walkers. There was no stench in the air yet, Dyason said, and the removal was expected to be completed later on Friday.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
