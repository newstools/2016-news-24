However, when police, accompanied by a member of the HPCSA inspectorate, visited his rooms yesterday, Boulter was still seeing patients.As the Richmond district surgeon, Boulter has been performing post-mortems for the police as well as testing drunk drivers and drug users without being registered with the HPCSA.Boulter, well-known and liked in the Richmond community, was visibly stressed and upset as he reversed out of the gates of his house, nestled among leafy trees and plants, yesterday.With his hands gripping the steering wheel, Boulter grimly confirmed that he was chief medic for the Comrades, saying he could not comment on the investigation.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk to you right now about it,&rdquo; he said.Later, in a phone call to The Witness, Boulter said he was not prepared to discuss the allegations but did not think Comrades &ldquo;deserved to be dragged through the mud&rdquo;.&ldquo;I am the co-ordinator of the medical tent. I do not actually treat anyone,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Comrades is a big organisation and it does not deserve to be involved in this.&rdquo;Comrades Ultra Marathon spokesperson Delaine Cools said Boulter had been with the Comrades medical team for over 30 years.She said the marathon organisers were unaware of the allegations and could not comment.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
