A 34-year-old man was mauled to death last week by two dogs during a suspected burglary at a home in Lotus River. A graphic video that went viral on social media shows the alleged burglar being bitten by two dogs while bystanders try to divert the dogs&rsquo; attention by throwing bricks and stones. Warrant Officer Wynita Kleinsmith, Grassy Park police spokesperson, says: &ldquo;An inquest docket was opened at Woodstock police station after a man of Lotus River died in hospital after he was bitten by dogs on premises in Lotus River. What we can confirm is that the man does not stay on the premises where the dogs attacked him. He was still alive when he was transported to hospital.&rdquo; The incident occurred last Monday at about 15:30, Kleinsmith says. &ldquo;We are awaiting the docket from Woodstock police thereafter it will be investigated by Grassy Park police as an inquest. One of the dogs was shot on the scene by police to protect and assist the man who was bitten by the dogs,&rdquo; she says. In the video a bystander can be heard saying &ldquo;because he wants to steal here so the dogs catched him&rdquo;. During the eight-minute video the man is bitten by the dogs until shots are fired. People have displayed outrage on social media, saying &ldquo;the dogs were protecting their property. The man got what he deserved.&rdquo; Someone else wrote: &ldquo;I have no sympathy for the man! The dogs were protecting their yard and one got killed for doing so, which is very upsetting.&rdquo; Philip Bam, spokesperson of the local community police forum, says the incident is unfortunate. &ldquo;We do regret the loss of life and send our condolences to the family and loved ones of the man who died. However, we need to make it clear that residents have the right to protect their properties, especially with the lack of service being received from our police.&rdquo; He adds: &ldquo;Police are always encouraging residents to do what it takes to protect their property. Criminals should understand that when you enter a person&rsquo;s property with criminal intent, you will have to bear the consequences.&rdquo; Bam says it is sad that the &ldquo;criminal had to pay the ultimate price&rdquo;. &ldquo;When trespassing in a person&rsquo;s property illegally and your intentions are not noble and pure, there are consequences. However, we do encourage residents to put up warning signs outside their homes if they do have aggressive animals on their premises,&rdquo; he says. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
