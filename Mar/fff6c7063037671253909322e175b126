Port Elizabeth – Police have launched an operation to end gang violence in Port Elizabeth in the coming months. "Operation Lockdown", announced by Police Minister Nkosinathi Nhleko and acting national police commissioner Lieutenant General Khomotso Phahlane on Thursday, was aimed at combating gang violence and crime in Bethelsdorp and Gelvandale in Port Elizabeth. Phahlane said police would ensure criminals would be left feeling “uncomfortable”. “We are doing this, as the SAPS, because we have listened to the community and we want to support them and make their lives safer by taking the gangs' illicit markets away from them." The operation, which started three weeks before the official launch, had already yielded 21 arrests in both areas. National and provincial authorities would help local police during the operation, which would run until 30 June. Its results would then be reviewed and it would be re-evaluated.
