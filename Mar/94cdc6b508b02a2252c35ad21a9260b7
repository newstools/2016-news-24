	     Cape Town    – A traffic officer has sustained minor injuries after being hit by a taxi on the N2 on Tuesday morning, the City of Cape Town said. Mayoral committee member for safety and security, JP Smith, said an attempted murder charge was opened after the driver was arrested. “A traffic officer stopped a taxi for overtaking on the shoulder of the road on the N2.  “The officer tried to remove the keys from the ignition when the driver tried to escape. [He] deliberately knocked [the traffic officer] over and drove away.” Members of the city’s 'ghost squad' managed to stop the driver, who was arrested and taken to Nyanga East police station, Smith said. Operation Throttle Traffic Services this week resumed Operation Throttle, initially launched last year, aimed at cracking down on traffic transgressions by public transport vehicles.  “The first three enforcement sessions    – which coincide with morning and afternoon peak hours    – were held at the N2 and Jakes Gerwel Drive on Monday and the R300 and N2 today,” Smith said. “To date, there have been 34 arrests, 15 vehicle impoundments and 3 294 fines issued for various offences including speeding, overloading, not wearing seat belts and unlicensed drivers.” A total of 23 of those arrested were found to have outstanding warrants of arrest pending, he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
