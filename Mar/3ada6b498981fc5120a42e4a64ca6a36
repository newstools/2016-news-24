Amanda Khoza, News24 Durban &ndash; Msunduzi municipality&rsquo;s city manager, Mxolisi Nkosi, was suspended with immediate effect on Friday, pending an investigation into alleged maladministration and corruption, the council said. Municipal spokesperson Nqobile Madondo said Nkosi was suspended at a special full-council meeting. She said Nkosi, who would receive his full salary, would be temporarily replaced by deputy municipal manager&nbsp;Boniwe Zulu. "[The] council believes in the innocent until proven guilty principle and as such we strongly urge the media to respect Nkosi&rsquo;s privacy and right to fight the allegations levelled against him,&rdquo; said Madondo. &nbsp; KwaZulu-Natal Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube said last month her department was investigating allegations of maladministration and corruption at the Msunduzi municipality.She said damning allegations had been brought to the department's attention by whistleblowers.&nbsp; Nkosi confirmed that he had been suspended. "I have not received the letter that contains my suspension conditions; I will fetch it on Monday." He would comment further, saying it might jeopardise the investigation. A municipal employee said Nkosi was being targeted for leading a campaign that supported former ANC chairperson and current Premier Senzo Mchunu. Provincial ANC chairperson Sihle Zikalala trumped Mchunu during a provincial elective conference last year. &nbsp;&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
