	     Student accommodation developer John Schooling says that protests over accommodation at universities have been "a long time coming." In response to the shack Rhodes Must Fall members erected on Jammie Plaza at the University of Cape Town Schooling said, "The shortfall for student accommodation has been coming for quite some time." 
He views the shack as correct and symbolically powerful. "I thought it was actually a touch of genius," says Schooling. His company, STAG African, develops student housing on campus. The developer has worked on sites at the University of Fort Hare, Walter Sisulu University and the University of Stellenbosch.WATCH Johannesburg – Students at Stellenbosch University are expected to protest against colonial statues at the institution on Wednesday. Student Representative Council leader Lwazi Pakade said they would be handing over a memorandum of demands to the institution in the afternoon. He said workers would be protesting against outsourcing, while students were fighting for the eradication of colonial statues. "We expect a huge turnout from students," he told News24. Another student named Jody told News24 that they would be meeting at the Rooiplein steps at 12:30 and the workers would be mobilising at 06:00. Last week, students aligned to the EFF slapped a poster onto a statue of Jan Marais. The statue was erected after Marais donated £100 000 in 1918. News24 previously released video clips taken on social media showing black and white students shouting at each other while police tried to keep them apart. Stellenbosch University spokesperson Martin Viljoen said they were aware of the planned protests. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
