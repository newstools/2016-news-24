According to the state-owned Herald newspaper, Tomana is facing charges of criminal abuse of office after releasing two suspects linked to the failed plot to bomb President Robert Mugabe's Gushungo Dairy farm in Mazowe. Tomana is out on a $1 000 bail and is expected to report to the police at least once a week . Tomana reportedly released the two suspects, saying that they were going to be state witnesses during the trial of other suspects also linked to the failed bombing. Reports indicated that on January 26, police arrested four men, including two soldiers, on charges of plotting to bomb Mugabe's dairy.The four were named as Owen Kuchata, &nbsp;Borman Ngwenya, Solomon Makumbe, and Silas Pfupa.Kuchata has since been sentenced to nine year in jail after pleading guilty to the charge. Meanwhile, according to New Zimbabwe,&nbsp;Tomana is facing a tough battle, as the the number of charges against him could lead to him being fired. Last month, the southern African country&rsquo;s Chief Justice Godfrey Chidyausiku wrote to Mugabe asking him to set up a commission of inquiry to evaluate the chief prosecutor&rsquo;s capability to hold office. Tomana has since launched a case to challenge the chief justice's decision to have him fired. &nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
