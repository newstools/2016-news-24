has been burned as tensions rise between the fast growing ride-hailing service
and conventional taxis. Nairobi Police chief Japheth Koome said on Wednesday that
a man hired the Uber taxi to the outskirts of the capital and led the driver to
a dark alley. Koome said the driver told police he saw four men
approach the car and managed to escape from the men who were trying to restrain
him. Koome said the car was completely burned. In late February an Uber car was burned by unknown
assailants. Taxi operators last month asked the government to stop
the operations of Uber, which has become popular because of its cheaper fares. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
