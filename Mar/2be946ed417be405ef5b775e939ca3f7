Lucky Vusi Dube, who has been on the run for more than a year, appeared before the court on charges of possession of unlicensed ammunition. According to Hawks spokesperson, Hangwani Mulaudzi, Dube was alleged to have been involved in robberies of a Standard Bank in Balfour‚ Mpumalanga; Bidvest Bank in Randburg; Absa Bank in Sandton; Absa Bank in Vereeniging; Nedbank in Johannesburg Central; Absa Bank in Norkempark‚ and Nedbank in Sandton. A breakthrough in another case led to Dube's arrest earlier this week. Police had arrested another man at the Jabulani Hostel in Soweto in connection with a robbery in Bramley. He led the Crime Intelligence Unit and the Hawks to Dube's home in Auckland Park on Tuesday where rounds of live ammunition were discovered. Mulaudzi said a verification test was done to ensure that Dube was the man they had been looking for. Dube's case was postponed to May 6 for the state to verify his address and his status in the country. Mulaudzi said the Hawks also needed to centralise all his outstanding bank robbery cases.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
