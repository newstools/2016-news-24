 Cape Town – Stellenbosch University has awarded a young doctor involved in fighting tuberculosis its Chancellor’s Medal for 2015, the institution’s highest honour. Dr Jacobus Kotze, 24, received his award at a graduation ceremony on Tuesday, the university said in a statement. Kotze, who is passionate about helping people with TB, said he was shocked when he was announced as the recipient. “I was surprised, it was great honour. My fiancé and I are very grateful,” he told News24. The Chancellor’s Medal is awarded annually to a final year or postgraduate student who has excelled in their studies. Kotze received his MB, ChB degree cum laude in December last year. He got an average of 81.42% during his six years of study. He passed 29 of his 31 modules with distinction. He had received awards including academic colours from the Tygerberg Student Council, the Rector’s Award for outstanding academic achievement, and SU’s merit bursary every year since 2010. Kotze was currently an intern doctor at East London Hospital. He said it was exciting to work with children and the NGO, TB Proof. The organisation advocated for improved transmission prevention, detection, and treatment of TB. Kotze said he was excited about a campaign called Unmask Stigma, that aimed to decrease the stigma around TB, which claimed 4 400 lives worldwide every day.
