A police source told AFP that Ag Sodack Dicko had played a logistical role in the attacks and had flown to the Malian capital Bamako shortly afterwards. Armed with grenades and assault rifles, the attackers stormed three hotels in Grand-Bassam, a resort popular with expats that lies 40km from Abidjan. It was the latest in a series of high-profile assaults in north and west Africa targeting locals and tourists alike.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
