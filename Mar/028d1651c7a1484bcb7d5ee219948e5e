According to Joy News, Justice Samuel Marful-Sau encouraged the judges to work harder in clearing the backlog.At least&nbsp;20 judges were sacked last year&nbsp;after they&nbsp;were implicated in what was termed the&nbsp;country's biggest judiciary scandals. The dismissals came after hearings before a five-member disciplinary committee appointed by Ghana's chief justice Georgina Wood focusing on undercover footage shot by a local newspaper.Justice Marful-Sau urged the judges&nbsp;to be "proactive" in applying CI 87, which he claimed would help in clearing up the&nbsp;cases. The CI 87 is an amendment of the High Court Procedure of CI 47 2004 which regulates civil proceedings in the High and Circuits courts. Marful-Sau said although the introduction of CI 87 was to speed up court cases, a number of lawyers and judges were yet to understand how the new system worked, adding that they were &nbsp;still holding on to the older traditional system. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
