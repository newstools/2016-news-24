Your sofa may be torn to shreds but at least kitty hasn't got claws this big. Photos posted this week by the&nbsp;Mokore Anti-poaching, Conservation &amp; Community, group that is based in Zimbabwe's Save Valley Conservancy, show a large lion in a pose that will be unmistakable to anyone who allows his or her felines inside the house: Stretched out and ready to rip.The lion's eyes glint in that wide-open "Don't you dare stop me" way as he stretches his whole body up what looks like a fairly thin trunk. He's found a perfect natural scratching post. The photos were taken at night at one of Mokore's monitoring points in the conservancy, the group said on Facebook.Home to the Big Five, the privately-run Save Valley Conservancy is situated in the dry south-east of Zimbabwe, about 300 kilometres from the Beitbridge border. It is near to Gonarezhou National Park, which is best known for its elephant population.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
