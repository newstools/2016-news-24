But we will pounce any time from today [Sunday]."Meyiwa was at his girlfriend Kelly Khumalo's home in Vosloorus on October 26 2014 when a man entered and shot him, apparently during a scuffle. Zanukuhle Mbatha, initially arrested for the murder, was released from custody in November due to a lack of evidence.IOL reported Reports suggest that those present when he was shot included Khumalo, her two children, her mother, Ntombi, her sister, Zandi, two of Meyiwa's friends and her sister's boyfriend, Longwe Twala.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
