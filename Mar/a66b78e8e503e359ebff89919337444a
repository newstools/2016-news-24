Calling the crisis "debilitating", the MDC said on Saturday that some banks had restricted cash withdrawals from ATMS and tellers. Cash shortages, a feature of Zimbabwe's 2008 economic and political crisis, resurfaced at the beginning of March. Significant job losses in 2015 and a slowdown in industrial activity has meant fewer people are using banks in the southern African country. The Morgan Tsvangirai-led MDC said illegal money changers had resurfaced on the streets, charging stiff premiums for anyone wanting to buy US dollars, the party charged. "If this continues, shortages of goods will start appearing and queues might develop for fuel," said the statement. Zimbabwe abandoned its own currency in 2009 and now uses mainly the US dollar and the South African rand, although other currencies are also legal tender.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
