With a mischievous gleam in her eyes, Myrtveit said, "I didn't know what that was all about."At first, his dad thought he was crazy for wanting to dog-sled out in freezing weather.But their parents had an about-turn after being treated to a trip on the sled. Now, they asked about the races and knew a lot of the dogs by name.Do what we love"They just want us to do what we love," said Bussio.The pair loved their animals and could identify each dog simply by its bark.As the person who does most of the training and feeding, it was important to Bussio to put the job first and the cuddles a very close second.Myrtveit offered her support as a handler during races."It's very important that you trust each other,"he said, resting his hand gently on hers.When he felt angry, he often employed a creative use of Afrikaans swear words. "If I get angry, I have to get angry with her because the dogs won&rsquo;t move if they pick that up," Bussio said."And then I just slap you," Myrtveit replied playfully.With their passion and the right sponsors, their dream to become full-time "mushers" may not be that far off.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
