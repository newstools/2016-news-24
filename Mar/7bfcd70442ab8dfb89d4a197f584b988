According to Mabuza, law enforcement officers played a large role in reducing the number of accidents. The department's aim was to have zero accidents on the province's roads."It is more worrying that more people are found on the roads driving under the influence of alcohol. This shows that people don&rsquo;t care about their lives," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
