In recent weeks, some top officials of the ruling party have called on Biya to think about running for the next election expected in 2018, which would require a change to the constitution.An amendment to the constitution in 2008 had removed the two-term limit for a president, allowing Biya to run again. He was re-elected for seven years in 2011. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
