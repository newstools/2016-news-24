A plant employee who did not wish to be named told AFP that the site is surrounded by a security fence and soldiers are permanently on guard."The rockets seem to have been fired from very far away," he said.Military personnel mobilised soon after the rocket fire to prevent the jihadists gaining access to the facility, the employee added.
