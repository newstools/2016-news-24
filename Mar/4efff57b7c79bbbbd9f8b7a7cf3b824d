Durban - Two gutsy security guards, armed only with pepper spray, took on a gang who were allegedly attempting to steal a car using remote jamming in Empangeni at the weekend. The pair managed to catch the alleged jammers in the act, before one of the men led them on a chase through a busy shopping centre parking lot. Sdumo Nyawo, a Control Risks Group guard posted at the shopping complex, told News24 that he had been on duty when a man had parked his Toyota Fortuner in the centre, and was concerned when his car would not lock. The customer alerted security officials and Nyawo and a colleague watched the car in question. "A man in a VW Polo went to the Fortuner and got inside the car. They had obviously been the ones who jammed the locks when the customer was trying to use his key," he said. "We ran to the car and when we got there we tried to keep him inside, but he escaped and we chased him," he said. Nyawo and another guard chased the man through the parking lot and into traffic. "I caught the guy and the Polo came again with his friends and I thought the car was going to hit me. I sprayed him with my pepper spray, but he wasn't worried about it. His friend pulled him into the car and they drove off," he said. Asked what had motivated the heroic deed, Nyawo brushed it off, saying he was passionate about his work.
