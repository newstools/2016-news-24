Visiting Ivory Coast on Friday, Sarkozy placed flowers at a memorial at the hotel Etoile du Sud, one of several sites attacked on Sunday in the town of Grand-Bassam that left 19 dead, in addition to three gunmen. In brief remarks, Sarkozy said Ivory Coast was targeted because it's a democracy where Muslims and Christians co-exist peacefully. Sarkozy is a divisive figure in Ivory Coast, having led France during its military intervention in Ivory Coast's post-election violence in 2011 that brought President Alassane Ouattara to power. Sarkozy was also scheduled to meet with Ouattara and to speak at Ivory Coast's biggest university. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
