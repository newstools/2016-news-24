We, therefore, commit to working with existing organisations that play a critical role in fighting all forms of gender violence and oppression in the province," the party declared.The ANC lekgotla also called for more unity within the embattled province.The upcoming local government elections presented a moment to sharpen the party's plans to ensure maximum unity in order to unseat the DA, the party said.The lekgotla was also attended by delegates from the various party leagues and structures.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
