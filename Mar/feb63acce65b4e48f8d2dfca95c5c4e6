	     Cape Town – A Cape Town metro police officer had to act as a midwife on Tuesday morning after an ambulance was blocked from entering Dunoon. Constable Abdullah Fisher was monitoring a violent protest in Ekuphumleni Road around 07:00 when a resident told him a woman nearby was in labour, said the city’s safety and security mayoral committee member, JP Smith. Burning tyres and protesters made it impossible for an ambulance to enter. Fisher and two colleagues had to walk a distance to the woman’s home. Armed with shotguns, Constable Philiswa Mayekiso - acting as a translator - and Acting Sergeant Brydon Hoffman accompanied Fisher between the shacks. When they got to the 29-year-old woman, Fisher snapped on blue surgical gloves, before delivering a healthy baby boy on the floor of her home. With her bundle of joy in hand, they transported her to the N7 so an ambulance could take them to Somerset Hospital. Fisher declined an interview. Smith said he was "super proud" of the officers.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
