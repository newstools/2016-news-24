Durban - Four men linked to a gun battle between police officers and members of a heavily armed gang in KwaMashu on Wednesday have been arrested. Police confirmed that officers had descended on a local clinic where four alleged gang members, who had been wounded in the firefight, were arrested. Three police officers were also injured in the shoot-out. Police spokesperson Major Thulani Zwane said that shortly after 1:00, police had resonded to a report of an armed robbery in progress at the Bridge City Mall. "A group of suspects travelling in two Toyota Fortuners broke down the back door of one of the shops in the mall and gained entry. They removed a large quantity of cigarettes from the store. They proceeded to another shop where they planted explosives at an ATM," he said. Zwane said police were alerted to the robbery and responded immediately. When police arrived on the scene, the suspects opened fire them. Police returned fire causing the suspects to flee the scene. It is understood that the men then hijacked two cars to make their getaway, one of them a security vehicle. "Two vehicles which were hijacked during the robbery were later recovered in Inanda Newtown C. An Intelligence driven operation led police to a local clinic where four suspects were arrested," he said. "One of the suspects who had sustained gunshot wounds, is under police guard at a hospital whilst the other three were transported to KwaMashu SAPS for detention." While at the police station, one of the suspects is alleged to have tried to disarm a police officer and was shot dead in the process. "A scuffle ensued, resulting in one of the suspects being fatally wounded. Charges of inquest, attempted murder, malicious damage to property, armed robbery and attempted robbery were opened for further investigation," he said. Zwane added that the Hawks were investigating the case and would be hunting several other suspects who remain at large.
