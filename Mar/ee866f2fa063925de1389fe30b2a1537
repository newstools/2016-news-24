Iavan Pijoos, News24Johannesburg - As long as the two boys accused of killing a Katlehong baby girl and two young women are behind bars, the family feels safe, the victims&rsquo; mother said on Friday. "We feel safe when they are behind bars. I was in hospital for two days, because I suffer from stress and trauma," Thembi Letsoalo told News24 outside the Palm Ridge Magistrate&rsquo;s Court.Two of Letsoalo&rsquo;s daughters, her niece, and, baby granddaughter were attacked, allegedly by two boys aged 17 and 21, in her Katlehong home, on the East Rand, in December. One of the daughters, Nthabiseng Letsoalo, 23, survived. Her sister Lerato Letsoalo, 18, cousin Priska Movit, 23, and Movit&rsquo;s six-month-old baby girl Bokamoso Movit, were killed.The two accused allegedly stabbed them and put them in a bathtub filled with boiling water. They may not be named as one of them is a minor and they are related. At their last appearance in February, the case was postponed for the State to receive DNA test results. The DNA results would only be available on 5 April, a full courtroom of family and friends heard on Friday. The tests were conducted on the bloodied clothing that the two accused allegedly wore on the day of the crime, as well as the knife used in the attack.&nbsp;The two would be back in court on 22 March. Both would stay in police custody. The minor was in a correctional centre for children in Soshanguve.Letsoalo said they were pleased with the case being postponed. "We were told that they are just waiting for the minor to turn 18," she said. This meant he could be put on trial as an adult. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
