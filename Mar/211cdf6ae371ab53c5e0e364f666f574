According to the state-owned Chronicle&nbsp;newspaper, Joyce Taga, 13, was found hanging from a tree outside her home in the Mkoba 9 suburb of Gweru. The girl's grandmother said the teenager killed herself after she was reprimanded by her mother for coming home late from a church service the previous night. "I got a call from her mother at around 06:00 informing me that she had found Joyce hanging from a tree in their backyard. I quickly rushed to the scene and was shocked to see her hanging there," Gogo Nhenga was quoted saying. Meanwhile, Joyce's friend revealed that she returned from church on Monday troubled, but her efforts to ask what had happened proved futile. The incident occurred just a few days after Chronicle reported that a student at the National University of Technology (NUST) had hanged himself after blowing his university tuition on girls he had met at a night club. George Bunomali, 26, was found hanging in his room after hanging himself with a satellite dish cable, the report said.
