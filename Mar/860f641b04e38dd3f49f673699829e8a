According to New Zimbabwe, Darlington Kudangirana, 38, would be facing assault charges after his wife Tracy Madekutsikwa, 25, pressed charges against him. It is alleged that, on Friday last week, Madekutsikwa demanded to have sex with her husband before he left for work in the morning. Kudangirana, however, refused on the pretext that he was running late. Madekutsikwa kept on insisting and begging her husband, before trying to pull his pants down. Her husband then assaulted her before rushing to work. The aggrieved wife went to the police and reported the incident, leading to her husband&rsquo;s arrest. The trial is expected to start on Thursday.
