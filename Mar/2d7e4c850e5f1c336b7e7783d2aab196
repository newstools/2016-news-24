Dusu told Nigeria's highest-ranking army officer, chief of army staff General Tukur Buratai, during a visit to Bauchi on Monday that Moses was from the central state of Benue.He aroused suspicion among locals in Bauchi, who in turn alerted the military."Our troops on duty arrested Victor Moses after receiving a report from people in the area that the suspect had been loitering around the mosque claiming he was a Christian and wanted to convert to Islam," Dusu said as he paraded Moses before Buratai. "But he was not from the area, they suspected him and reported to our men".Boko Haram, which wants to create a hardline Islamic state in northeast Nigeria, has attacked Christian churches as well as government buildings in its nearly seven-year insurgency.It has also hit schools, markets, bus stations and mosques in an apparently indiscriminate targeting of civilians of all faiths that has left at least 17 000 dead since 2009.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
