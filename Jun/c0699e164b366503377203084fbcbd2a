Johannesburg â€“ Two men were sentenced to 15 years each for robbing an SABC news crew outside Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg, the National Prosecuting Authority said. The two men had their sentences handed down in the Johannesburg Regional Court on Tuesday, said NPA spokesperson Phindi Louw. In March 2015, video footage showing the two men accosting SABC contributing editor Vuyo Mvoko as he waited to deliver his report in front of the camera went viral on YouTube.  The cameras were rolling and the faces of the muggers were clearly visible. Cellphones and a laptop were stolen. "As the NPA, we are satisfied with the sentence because it is proportionate to the seriousness of the crime," Louw said.
