Cape Town – A Cape Town man went on the run after allegedly
handing in forged documents to obtain finance for two luxury vehicles in 2013. The Hawks tracked down Brett James, 27, and arrested him on
Monday for alleged fraud amounting to almost R1m, said Western Cape
spokesperson Captain Lloyd Ramovha. The arrest followed a lengthy investigation. James allegedly
handed in the forged documents to apply for bank finance for a BMW and a
Renault. "The latter vehicle was subsequently recovered after
the accused went on the run," Ramovha said. James appeared in the Bellville Magistrate’s Court on
Tuesday. He was granted R3 000 bail, and was warned to return to court on June
15.
