We hear of a new theft every week.&ldquo;We pleaded with the municipality to convert our electricity supply to a prepaid system because we could not afford to pay but now it is worse.&ldquo;We are not blaming the municipality for this crime but something should be done to stop it. &ldquo;They can start by fixing the streetlights and move the prepaid meters from the street into our homes,&rdquo; said Somduth.Somduth said they were told by a municipal official who installed the prepaid system for them that should their cables be stolen, they would be liable to pay R2 000 for reinstallation.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
