According to the state-owned Chronicle newspaper, Chinamasa said the government would use a further $3.3m to deliver the maize to vulnerable families around the country. The maize was imported under the country's drought relief programme, aimed at assisting vulnerable families with food. Zimbabwe reportedly needs at least 1.8 million tons of maize a year to feed people and animals. According to reports at the beginning of the year, the southern parts of the country were left with less than 8 weeks' supply of maize, forcing millers to urge government to grant permission for imports. Chinamasa said that the government had committed itself to importing at least 700 000 tons of maize between October 2015-December 2016. He said the distribution of the maize to the vulnerable families across the country stood at about 94 300 metric tons against a target of at least 120 000 metric tons.     24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
