No date for the trial has been set.According to court papers, the child was admitted to Inkosi Albert Luthuli hospital in Durban on March 29, 2010 as she was suffering from a congenital heart disorder requiring treatment and &ldquo;corrective surgery&rdquo;.The child underwent a heart operation on March 30, 2010.During the operation she was anaethetised and in order to help her to breathe, an endotracheal tube was inserted. She was also placed on a ventilator.The papers allege that following the operation the girl was admitted to the intensive care unit, where during the course of her post operative care, the tube became dislodged. This resulted in the child suffering a cardiac arrest and &ldquo;significant, irreversible brain damage&rdquo;.As a result of the alleged negligence by staff she is permanently disabled and cannot walk, see or hear.It is alleged that employees at the hospital breached their duty of care towards the child by failing to properly insert the tube in question; using an inferior quality tube the size of which was inappropriate for a child, failing to secure it and failing to take steps to ensure that the child could not inadvertently dislodge it. After the tube became dislodged it is alleged the staff failed to deal promptly and appropriately with the emergency situation that arose. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
