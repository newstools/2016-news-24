KZN provincial police said the woman, Anna-Malay Chetty, was linked to a case in which four other suspects also face charges of fraud, money laundering and racketeering in the commercial crimes court. They are due to appear in court next week.The cases are linked to an investigation launched by the KZN provincial task team earlier this year in connection with an alleged scam which was uncovered when a victim was approached in Pietermaritzburg by two men who offered him a R158 million tender from the Human Settlements Department. The victim was asked to pay R600 000 to secure the tender but became suspicious and alerted the police.Two men were arrested in a sting operation at the human settlements department in Pietermaritzburg on April 28. They were allegedly found in possession of fraudulent documents, a laptop, date stamps belonging to the KZN Treasurer&rsquo;s office and human settlements department, two cellphones, USB memory sticks and a VW Golf. At the time police said it was suspected that the men could be linked to as many as 29 cases of fraud.Police again urged any other people who were defrauded in a similar fashion to come forward and open cases. &mdash; Witness Reporter. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
