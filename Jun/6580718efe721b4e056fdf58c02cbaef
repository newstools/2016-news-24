The acting national police commissioner should be applauded for fighting off two armed robbers at a shop, Sanco national spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu said in a statement. "The criminals must get the message that our police officials are not pushovers, but crime fighters who will not relent in the face of adversity, but fight tooth and nail for survival and protection of the most vulnerable in our communities," he said.&nbsp; Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said Phahlane was in his car outside a&nbsp;spa in Rosebank when he saw two men&nbsp;in balaclavas and armed with pistols entering the building. That's when he&nbsp;sprung into action. &ldquo;He fought with the two guys with the view to take away the firearms. He managed to ward them off and they ran away." One shot was fired as the two assailants were running away, but nobody was injured. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
