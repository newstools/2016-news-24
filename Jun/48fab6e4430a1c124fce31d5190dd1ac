There's no suggestion that Theo De Marillac Safaris is doing anything illegal. The cull - reported to be of up to 400 hippos every year for the next five years - is officially to stop the spread of anthrax, an infection that can be fatal to humans. But the UK-headquartered Born Free organisation suggests that the cull is more about "trophy hunting" and says it will turn this 250km stretch of the Luangwa River into "killing fields". Born Free claims on its Facebook page that Theo De Marillac Safaris is marketing the hunts. On its website, Theo De Marillac Safaris urges potential clients to "experience the rare and exciting opportunity of participating in a controlled hippo hunt in Zambia's Upper and Lower Lupandi". "This walk and stalk hunt over the flood plains means hippo are hunted on land, making this a very exciting, adrenalin-pumping safari," says the company. A five-day safari - which will see five hippo hunted - will cost R129 500 while a seven-day safari, hunting seven hippo, will cost R181 300. Will Travers, Born Free founder, said in a statement: "At a time when wildlife populations of multiple species are under extreme pressure across much of Africa, many, including Born Free and our supporters around the world, fundamentally question the logic of killing thousands of hippo, and turning the flood plains of the Luangwa River Valley into ‘killing fields’."  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
