Most have been freed without charges. Others were convicted but were later acquitted or released on bail.The April protests were the largest since the 2014 election of el-Sissi, whose government insists that the islands of Tiran and Sanafir at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba belong to Saudi Arabia.A law adopted in 2013 bans all unauthorised demonstrations in Egypt.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
