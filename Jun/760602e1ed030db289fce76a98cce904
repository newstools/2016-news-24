Senior military official Brigadier-General Abdul-Salam al-Hassi blames the late Friday attack on Islamic militants. Al-Hassi and hospital official Mohammed al-Zawy confirmed that four people were killed and 14 wounded in the blast outside Jalal hospital. Al-Zawy says the explosives-laden car was parked near the hospital's outpatient entrance door. Al-Hassi says the militants "will not stop these terrorist attacks on civilians and we will do our best to secure the city after we defeat them." Military police cordoned off the hospital area after the blast, which sent a column of black smoke rising over the parking area. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
