Cape Town – A waiter has appeared in court after being found
with a card machine that resulted in his employer losing over R100 000 in
transactions, the Western Cape Hawks said on Thursday. Tawanda Chirume, 24, was arrested last week for unauthorised
possession of a point of sale device, spokesperson Captain Lloyd Ramovha said. Chirume allegedly used the device to process customer
payments, even though it did not belong to the establishment. “It is suspected that Chirume is part of a wider syndicate
that thrives on defrauding businesses as well as customers’ bank accounts,”
Ramovha said. He appeared in Grabouw Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. His
bail hearing was postponed for a week. In a separate matter, two people were arrested at Cape Town
International Airport on Wednesday morning for allegedly being in possession of
a point of sale device and several suspected cloned credit cards. They were expected to appear in the Bellville Magistrate’s
Court later on Thursday.
