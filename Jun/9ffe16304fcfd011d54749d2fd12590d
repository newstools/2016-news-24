His main opponent, Kizza Besigye, claimed victory and was charged with treason. Election observers said the polls were marred by irregularities.Besigye is detained at a maximum security prison in the capital, Kampala.The military last week arrested dozens of soldiers and officers, including a colonel with the country's air force, over links to alleged subversion. They are yet to be officially charged.The army spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Paddy Ankunda, told The Associated Press on Sunday that the officers in detention have suspected links to an opposition lawmaker, Michael Kabaziguruka, who is being questioned by police over similar allegations. Kabaziguruka is a close ally of Besigye.The treason charges pressed against Besigye, a four-time presidential challenger who once served in Museveni's government, have been criticised by some as an attempt to intimidate the opposition as Museveni's popular support wanes, especially in urban areas.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
