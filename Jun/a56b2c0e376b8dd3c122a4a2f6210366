Pietermaritzburg - A University of KwaZulu-Natal student will be flying to Germany later this month for the 66th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting. UKZN physics PhD student Sphumelele Ndlovu is among a select number of young scientists chosen to take part in the prestigious meeting of some of the world’s prominent academics. A press statement by UKZN said the Academy of Science of South Africa (ASSAf) nominated five top young scientists from South Africa to attend the meeting later this year in Lindau, Germany, with Ndlovu being one of those. Ndlovu will meet with Nobel laureates in the fields of physiology and medicine, physics, and chemistry from June 26 to July 1 this year. “Only 402 of the most qualified young scientists are given the opportunity to experience the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings,” said the statement. Ndlovu said this would be an “excellent opportunity” for inspiration towards his future research work. “I think that scientific exchange between different disciplines, regions of the world and generations is important for meaningful and productive scientific research,” he said. UKZN spokesperson Lesiba Seshoka said the institution was “delighted” that Ndlovu had been given this opportunity. “It will be an inspiring experience and is an outstanding achievement just to be selected to join other young scientists,” she said. — Witness Reporter.
