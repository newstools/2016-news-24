Studies had shown almost a quarter of South Africa's children had stunted growth, Masango said.&ldquo;We therefore challenge Minister Dlamini to come shopping with us on Wednesday, 22 June, at the Shoprite in Soweto, so that she can see for herself what R753 can buy.&rdquo;While Dlamini would not be drawn into answering questions about allegations that she stayed at the luxurious Oyster Box in Umhlanga last Sunday at a cost of R11 000, News24 has independently confirmed that she did. "Yes, she did stay there last night [Sunday] and paid R11 000," a well-placed source earlier told News24.This made the DA question how the minister could justify how she expected a family to survive on R753, while she stayed in obvious luxury. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
