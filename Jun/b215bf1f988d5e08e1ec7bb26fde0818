Helium's utility in scientific research stems from its nature as a stable, inert gas that becomes liquid at -269&deg;C, the lowest temperature of all the elements.It is usually only discovered in small quantities as a by-product of gas and oil drilling.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
