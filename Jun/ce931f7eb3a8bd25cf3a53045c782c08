Sattar reportedly claimed that their relationship was against her culture. However, in 2015- before Kali gave birth- Sattar changed her mind and made a pact with Mhango that he would be given the baby after birth but he should end the relationship with her daughter. The court heard that after Kali gave birth, the two sneaked out of the country without notifying Mhango, forcing him to seek court&rsquo;s help. Passing down judgement Senior Resident Magistrate Viva Nyimba said that the police should investigate and prosecute Sattar for a criminal offence "bordering on child trafficking or infanticide or homicide".&nbsp; He further stated that the Malawi Human Rights Commission (MHRC) must investigate Sattar for allegedly discriminating Mhango on grounds of race, color and religion.This was not the first time that a baby was abducted in the southern African country.According to Malawi24 a newly born baby at Phalombe Health Centre in Phalombe district was abducted while the mother went to the toilet. The child's mother Tressa Mukoko Kasowa, 18, claimed that the incident happened four hours after she had given birth.

Nkhwazi said that the police suspect that the thieves might have abducted the child after the hospital lights went out. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
