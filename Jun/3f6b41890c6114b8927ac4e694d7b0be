School governing bodies could also have their wings clipped regarding their right to recommend people for senior posts.On Thursday, Sadtu hit back at these recommendations. "Tampering with parental rights was a recipe for disaster and an insult to our ancestors who fought against Bantu education&hellip; Any attempt to take away powers from SGBs is counter revolutionary."The union also said that while there had been success in education since 1976, "many challenges still prevail"."The African working class child" was the kind of student left most disadvantaged. "They are subjected to overcrowded classroom conditions&hellip;"The union also cited access to teacher development, school infrastructure and the non-implementation of the African languages policy as problematic: "Language is life and with it comes unity of purpose to defeat an ideology that oppresses the working class&hellip;"Sadtu criticised certain assessment practices, suggesting that "rote learning, as entrenched in the testing regime, has become the killer of our children"."We cannot allow the gains that were made through the sacrifices of the Class of 76, to go in vain."Thursday marks the 40th anniversary of student uprisings in Soweto, when thousands of black students took to the streets in peaceful protests against apartheid-era 'Bantu education' practices and were violently attacked by police, leading to numerous deaths.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
