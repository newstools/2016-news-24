They apparently began occupying the land illegally in January and building shacks. &nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;The planned eviction of hundreds of people is inhumane. We urge the municipality to desist from engaging in brutal, inhumane evictions, especially in winter, and we are opposing the manner in which they are doing it,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp; The SAHRC was willing to provide guidance to the municipality in eviction-related matters. Municipality spokesperson Qondile Khedama said he would comment at a later stage. &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
