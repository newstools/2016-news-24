	     Nairobi - The father of one of the students who died during an attack on Garissa University in Kenya by al-Shabaab militants in 2015 has sued the institution for failing to protect his son. According to The Star, Gakuru Michire sought compensation from the university following the death of his son, Samuel Michire.  The assault by al-Shabaab on April 2, 2015 left at least 148 people dead, mostly students of the Garissa University College. Michire said his son was undertaking a bachelors degree in education at the time. His lawyer Njiru Ndegwa named Garissa University college, Kenya's Attorney General and Inspector General of Police as first, second and third respondent respectively. In his affidavit to the court, Michire said that the inspector general of police was legally mandated under Article 245(2)(b) to have the command over the National Police Service, including that of ensuring that there was law and order within the country, a report by Daily Nation said. Michire further stated that the aforementioned organs failed to secure the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country, thus posing a threat to his son. The matter was set to be heard on Friday. The attack which took place at dawn and targeted sleeping students, was led by four Shabaab militants who were all killed by Kenyan forces in the attack. In May this year, Kenya announced that the attack mastermind Mohammed Kuno, alias Gamaderere was killed in a US drone attack in Somalia, just over a year after the massacre.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
