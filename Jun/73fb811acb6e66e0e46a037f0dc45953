Currently 77% of the country&rsquo;s water comes from surface water rivers, 14% comes from return water from water treatment plants and nine percent comes from ground water.&ldquo;A major priority is to diversify these sources given the high risk of water shortages in the short to medium term. A renewed focus on effluent treatment in inland areas and on desalination in coastal areas will be necessary to adequately diversify resources.&rdquo;The council also announced that the provincial department of Human Settlements had commissioned a probe to investigate irregularities in the allocation of RDP houses. The probe will be done by an institute linked to the University of KwaZulu-Natal&rsquo;s Maurice Webb Race Relations Institute.The probe was initiated after claims that the allocation of low-cost housing in KZN was open to abuse and riddled with fraud and nepotism.&ldquo;It is alleged that houses are &shy;allocated to friends, relatives or political connections who do not qualify in terms of national allocations criteria. It is further alleged that houses are sold by councillors for personal gain. &ldquo;On the other hand councillors are allegedly allocating houses or taking possession of houses which they use to collect rentals from tenants for personal gain. &ldquo;In some instances members of the executive council have received complaints that more than one house is illegally allocated to one household or persons,&rdquo; the council said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
