Loyd Mulungu and Joseph Miambu were caught close to the South African and Zimbabwean border, spokesperson Manelisi Wolela said. He could not say when they escaped and when they were caught. Mandla Matimba Mokoena, Alfonso Mpofu, Chris Sithole, Knowledge Machesa, Emmanuel Hobe/Banda, and Cloupuis Tapiwa were still at large. Acting regional correctional services commissioner Willie Damons said the investigation into the escape was at an advanced stage. He had commissioned an assessment of security at Mogwase. Major renovations were still underway to convert Mogwase into a rehabilitation-friendly and highly-secure prison. Anyone with information about the whereabouts of the six escapees could contact Captain Phekoat on 082-373-9806 or 014-555-2217.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
