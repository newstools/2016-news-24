The US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control said it had sanctioned military commander Marius Ngendabanka, security official Ignace Sibomana and rebel leader Edouard Nshimirimana. The statement said it had sanctioned the three men for engaging in actions or policies that threaten the peace, security or stability of Burundi. According to the UN at least 400 people have died since Nkurunziza run for and won a third term that many say is unconstitutional. The sanctions mean all assets of those named are frozen in the US and US nationals are prohibited from engaging in transactions with them. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
