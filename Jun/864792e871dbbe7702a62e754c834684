Cape Town – Two former Western Cape police officers were arrested for corruption and theft on Friday. The two - formerly stationed at the Harare police station - would appear in the Khayelitsha Magistrate's Court later on Friday, spokesperson Constable Noloyiso Rwexana said.   They were arrested after a lengthy investigation following an incident where they allegedly took money and drugs from a suspect in Makhaza, Khayelitsha, in December, 2015.   The two officers searched a house and allegedly found tik and R3 000 cash. They then informed the complainant that they were going to arrest her.   After taking the complainant to the Harare police station, they allegedly asked her if she would give them money not to get arrested.   "The members then took her to her house, informed her that they will keep the money and drugs and collect R1 000 from her the next day. She reported the matter at Harare Police Station on 2015-12-04 and identified the members," Rwexana said.   Both suspects, a police officer and a reservist, were subjected to disciplinary processes and dismissed from the SAPS before their arrest, she said.   "Police management in the province remain committed to root out corruption within its ranks," said Rwexana.
