It is believed that the baby was born and dumped in the toilet. According to police spokesperson Lieutenant Raphael Motloung, the baby was heard crying by a neighbour who informed prison officials that were passing on the road. The baby was retrieved from the toilet by prison officials and taken to a nearby hospital in a stable condition. “A 24-year-old woman who is believed to be the mother of the baby is going to be arrested soon because she is known in the area,” said Motloung.
