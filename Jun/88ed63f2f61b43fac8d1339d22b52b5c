"It was reported that he was safe in the harbour and suffering bite wounds following a reported shark encounter, believed to be with a Great White shark, while spearfishing off-shore of Ryspunt.&rdquo;The man had multiple lacerations, a tear to his left leg, and lacerations to his right hand, caused by trying to fight the shark off.NSRI medics and Fire and Rescue Services paramedics treated the man before he was taken to Bredasdorp hospital, where he was stabilised.
