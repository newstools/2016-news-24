The NSPCA's Jaco Pieterse, who was part of the joint operation, joined us in studio. Watch. WATCH Johannesburg - The NSPCA is investigating an apparent dog fighting
event which was advertised on a website and mobile billboard in Johannesburg on
Monday. Pictures of the billboard went viral on social media sites,
prompting people to inundate the NSPCA with reports. Spokesperson Wendy Wilson said she had been overwhelmed with
reports of the billboard, which she described as "brazen". "We have been inundated with calls about this this
morning and we are investigating now," she said. "This is something that we are very used to and I don't
think that the general public is used to seeing something so brazen,"
Wilson added. She confirmed that dog fighting in any form was illegal. "It is 100% illegal and everything to do with it is
illegal. The dog fighting scene is huge and it has grown rapidly over the years
and seems to be becoming South Africa's national sport," she said. "There is a lot of money to be made out of this blood
sport," she added. Calls to the number listed on the billboard go directly to a
booking line voicemail.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
