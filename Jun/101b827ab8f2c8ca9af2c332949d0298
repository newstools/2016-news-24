He is currently also facing trial at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.More than 3 000 people died in the post-poll bloodbath which petered out on the arrest of the Gbagbo couple in 2011, when troops stormed the bunker where they had taken refuge in the nation's main city, Abidjan.Simone Gbagbo denies charges of crimes against prisoners of war, crimes against the civilian population and crimes against humanity.Several human rights groups representing victims have pulled out of the legal proceedings, saying the case against her was flawed and too hastily organised.Prosecutors hit back at the criticism on Wednesday.
