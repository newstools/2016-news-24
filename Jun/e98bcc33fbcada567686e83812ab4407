These orders were usually made after the conviction of individuals who benefited from the proceeds of criminal activity.Ramovha said they were content with the sentence meted out, particularly because the potential loss stood at R500 000, while the actual loss was R10 000.Officers last month executed search and seizure warrants at their home and two addresses in Vredenburg.The raids were co-ordinated at the same time and officers seized several documents and suspected stolen property.Klassen-Adonis and her father Dennis Klassen were expected to stand trial in Johannesburg later this year for a separate case, facing 102 charges of fraud and theft involving about R8m.Klassen was a former director of the Red Ant Security Services, while his daughter was a former director of the company's Cape Town branch.They were accused of "acting together in defrauding the company assets... between 2010 and 2013", according national police spokesperson Brigadier Vish Naidoo.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
