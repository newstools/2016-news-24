Watchdog groups have described Kafia Kingi as a safe haven for Kony because African troops hunting for him do not have access to the territory.One of Kony's former lieutenants, Dominic Ongwen, was arrested in CAR last year and sent to face trial at The Hague.The LRA, which originated in Uganda in the 1980s as a tribal uprising against the government, became well-known for kidnapping children to become fighters and forcing girls to be sex slaves.The group is reportedly in decline, with many of its fighters surrendering or killed in firefights with African troops.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
