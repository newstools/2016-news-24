According to The Monitor, an opposition rally on Tuesday in the Kahama District was met with tear gas, just a few hours after the ban was announced. The Chadema opposition party was protesting against President John Magufuli’s leadership style. According to The Citizen, at least 22 people were arrested and appeared in the Kahama District Court on charges of being involved in an illegal gathering. Chadema said that their rally was cancelled moments after it had been approved. The move was deemed unreasonable and "a blatant abuse of power".   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
