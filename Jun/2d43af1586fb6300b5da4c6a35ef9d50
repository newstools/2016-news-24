Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha confirmed on Twitter on Sunday that the mother of three had died in the accident. The former nurse was sworn in as a member of the Limpopo legislature in 2008, and served in various portfolios including local government and housing. Matshoge was also the chairperson of the African National Congress Women’s League in Limpopo. The ANCWL on Sunday said the members and supporters of ANCWL had lost one of its first lines of defence, of the rights of the women of South Africa. "Cde Joy was fearless yet humble leader of our movement. At all times she upheld the principles of democratic centralism and work tirelessly to build a progressive united ANCWL,” the party said in a statement. They said her outstanding leadership and selfless servant qualities would dearly be missed within the ranks of the organisation. “Her untimely death has robbed us of a disciplined, dedicated cadre of our revolution.”  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
