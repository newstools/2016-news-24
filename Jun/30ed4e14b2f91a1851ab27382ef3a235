When Franziska did not arrive at the agreed meeting place, the family began to worry.She was later found strangled and raped. She had been robbed of her iPhone, watch, headset and diamond ring.The accused are understood to have been linked to the crime through witnesses and were found in possession of her belongings.The case was postponed to July 28 for further investigation.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
