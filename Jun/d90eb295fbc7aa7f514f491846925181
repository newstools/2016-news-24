She said the activists had blocked access to her driveway and demanded that she go outside to address them. Sch&auml;fer insisted she had no issue with engaging with any organisation. &ldquo;Today, however, a line was crossed. They came, apparently, to hand me what they have called a social audit.&nbsp; I have engaged with Equal Education on numerous occasions on social media regarding this issue of their &lsquo;social audit&rsquo; &ndash; at no point did they request to meet me or try and engage with me at my workplace.&rdquo; &nbsp; She said she had asked for the report on several occasions and have not received it. What she did receive, Sch&auml;fer said, was hundreds of hand written notes from pupils which had to be collated by district directors to whom the audit was addressed. The information did not refer to specific cases or dates and some issues were in relation to their community, which was not the responsibility of the WCED, she pointed out. &ldquo;The WCED drafted a response to Equal Education which has not yet been sent by the department at the time of the protest today. Their demand of two weeks was simply not possible or reasonable, given the disorderly documents provided to us which had to be individually collated and captured, as well as the huge amount of work the districts have to do every day. &ldquo;If Equal Education wanted me to respond, why did they address the &lsquo;report&rsquo; to the district directors, and why have they to date still failed to furnish me directly with a copy?&nbsp; They clearly know my email address &ndash; which is used by them on a frequent basis, to which we respond at length on various issues.&rdquo; Sch&auml;fer said she did not collect the group&rsquo;s memorandum not because she was fearful of the pupils &ldquo;but because I will not allow a dangerous precedent to be set that people can feel entitled to march illegally to my home&rdquo;. &ldquo;The learners are more than welcome to meet with me at my office at a mutually convenient time if they wish to engage constructively in a genuine attempt to improve education in the Western Cape.&rdquo; Police spokesperson Andre Traut confirmed officers monitored the picket on Thursday morning. &ldquo;The small group of protesters dispersed peacefully at around 08:35,&rdquo; he said. No one was arrested. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
