It is only the two Nigerians that had injuries while one or two others have some scars."They have received medical treatment and been in touch with their families, he added.Kidnapping for ransom has been a long-standing problem in southern Nigeria, particularly in the oil-producing delta region, where criminal gangs target wealthy Nigerians and expatriate workers.Most are usually released after the payment of a ransom but New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said on Thursday his government would adhere to its policy of not paying kidnappers.Macmahon has an $18 million per year contract with the United Cement Company of Nigeria Ltd (UniCem) for quarrying operations at UniCem's cement manufacturing plant at Mfamosing, near Calabar.UniCem is a joint venture between Franco-Swiss conglomerate LafargeHolcim and Flour Mills of Nigeria, according to the Australian firm's website.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
