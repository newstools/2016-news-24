Police found him in possession of an unauthorised point of sale device used to compromise bank card data, Ramovha said. Madziwadondo, a waiter at a Milnerton restaurant, stands accused of "card not present fraud", which involves the recording of card details for possible cloning, he explained. "It is alleged the accused perpetrated these offences from a period between January and June 2016. Several customers across the major banks have fallen victims to his illicit acts," Ramovha said. "Investigations from the Hawks, as well as the banks, uncovered his involvement. On the day of his arrest, he was found in possession of several customers’ card details.” A substantial amount of money is believed to have been made in both cases, but the exact value is yet to be determined, Ramovha said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
