No one from the top government offices ever bothered to check how the cyanide was imported. Obviously it was a heavy duty ring. Elephants died in their hundreds. Money changed hands. A few villagers were sacrificed to serve lengthy terms in prison as the real culprits (government ministers) reaped huge profits and walked away scot free," Gutu said.First major cyanide poisoning incident&nbsp;He said the government had shown no interest in finding out how the regularly used cyanide poison was making its way into the country.Gutu's comments&nbsp;came just less than a week after News 24 reported that at least five elephants&nbsp;had been&nbsp;poisoned in the west of the country. The five elephants were poisoned with cyanide in a protected forest area at the Gwaai Forest.The dead elephants were found by a patrol which was tracking poachers in the Amandundumela area.In 2013, Zimbabwe experienced its first major cyanide poisoning incidents.
