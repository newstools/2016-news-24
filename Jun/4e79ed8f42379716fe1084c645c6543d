Migrants aboard a dinghy in the Mediterranean Sea wait to be rescued.

The crossing is extremely dangerous, the journey often takes more than 10 days," Leggeri said, adding that there were "few ships on this route that could save migrants from sinking boats".With the closure of the Balkans route popular with migrants seeking to reach northern European countries, as well as an EU deal with Turkey to halt departures, asylum seekers are turning to other options. Several North African ports, including Libyan ones, are gaining popularity as departure points, with Italy emerging as the key destination. "The central Mediterranean route has never been as popular," said Leggeri."Between 13 and 14 times more refugees are reaching Italy from Libya compared to migrants from Turkey to Greece," he said. More than 10 000 people have died crossing the Mediterranean to Europe since 2014, the UN said in early June. Following a rash of deadly shipwrecks that have claimed hundreds of lives, the UN refugee agency said the number of deaths at sea had risen sharply, with a record 2 814 people drowning since January. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
