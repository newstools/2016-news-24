Kenya is holding general elections next year.A mock coffin marked with the name of the legislator, Moses Kuria, was burned during Tuesday's protests, said the head of the Orange Democratic Party in Kibera slum, Sam Ochieng. Odinga is the party's leader.Kuria and seven other legislators have been questioned by police over remarks that police say may amount to hate speech. The legislators include four opposition members of parliament who threatened to storm the office of the police chief if he doesn't take action against Kuria.In the video shot at a party over the weekend, Kuria apparently refers to recent opposition demonstrations for changes in electoral commission, which the protesters accuse of corruption and bias."He should be careful because he can as well bite a bullet," Kuria says. "We won't be disturbed by one person. He can bite a bullet, we bury him the next Monday, they [Odinga supporters] throw stones for one week and life continues, isn't it so?" He made the remarks in his mother tongue, Kikuyu.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
