The Hawks have warned citizens to stop opening bank accounts for fraudsters. According to the Hawks Lieutenant Colonel Robert Netshiunda, they have noticed a trend in people receiving money from fraudsters and end up becoming subjects of investigation. Members of the community agree to open bank accounts and thereafter hand over the bank card to the person who requested them to do so. Criminals who hack people s online banking details use those recklessly opened bank accounts to distribute the money online and make withdrawals throughout the country, said Netshiunda. The Hawks are issuing a stern warning to people who open bank accounts not to give their cards and pin numbers to anyone, or risk becoming accomplices to various crimes. Over 55 suspects, most of them Nigerian nationals have so far been arrested for crimes varying from internet fraud, phishing and sim swap fraud. The account numbers used by these suspects to transfer money were found to have been legally opened by South Africans who voluntarily handed over their cards and pin numbers for a fee, he added. He also added that online dating has also become another way in which criminals use to defraud unsuspecting women. Those who visit those sites are advised not to deposit or transfer any money without verifying if they are chatting with a fraudster or a potential companion.Two women have recently been defrauded of R900 000 and R170 000 by Nigerian fraudsters, he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
