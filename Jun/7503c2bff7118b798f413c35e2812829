There was co-operation from all the parties involved, and it clearly indicated that we should get a good report at the SADC summit to be held in Swaziland in August. We are expecting a very positive progress report," said Zimbabwean Foreign Affairs Minister Simbarashe Mumbengegwe was quoted as saying .The summit was convened to follow up on previous recommendations made by the commission tasked with the political instability in Lesotho since 2014.&nbsp;Violence erupted in Lesotho at the time, shortly after the then president Tom Thabane made strong allegations that there were attempts to overthrow his government,&nbsp;leading to chaos in the country.&nbsp; This resulted in politicians and members of the defence force fleeing the country. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
