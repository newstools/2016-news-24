	     Pretoria - A man has died after shooting a woman and their child several times and then turning the gun on himself in Hammanskraal outside Pretoria in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The woman survived the shooting, and was airlifted by helicopter to a trauma hospital in Johannesburg. Netcare911 spokesperson Athlenda Mathe said the woman was “fighting for her life”. “Paramedics were called to Jubilee Community Hospital on Main Street in Hammanskraal. Reports from the scene indicate that a mother, child and father were found shot at their home,” she said. Mathe said that information gathered by medics suggested that the man had died at the scene, and his child had succumbed later after being rushed to the hospital. “Another Emergency service transported the mother and child to the hospital. The Netcare2 helicopter was dispatched to the hospital to airlift the critically wounded 32-year-old mother to a trauma facility in Johannesburg for further medical care,” she said. She said that details surrounding the shooting were scant.  “The exact detail as to how the three were shot will be subject for police investigation and comment.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
