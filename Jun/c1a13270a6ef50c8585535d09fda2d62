I don&rsquo;t want to be alive, just finish me!"Katengeza was&nbsp;one of those&nbsp;arrested for taking money&nbsp;over the looting of Malawi&rsquo;s treasury in 2013 in a corruption scam popularly known as Cashgate.Over $32m was stolen by politicians and top civil servants who&nbsp;used private companies and individuals to launder money, in the form of payments for services which were never offered to the government.'I don't deserve this life anymore'The bank account for Katengeza was used to help launder $146 000, which was a violation of the country&rsquo;s Money Laundering, Proceeds of &nbsp;Serious Crime and Terrorist Financing Act.In her ruling, Mwale said the court did not give Katengeza the maximum sentence of 15 years imprisonment because she was not the mastermind of the crime, but had ended up on the wrong side of the law for allowing her bank account to be used as a conduit for laundering of the money.Katengeza told media outside the court that she was hoodwinked by top government officials."I am not a civil servant, but I am just a sacrificial lamb of the State which does not know where the money went. What do I own now? I don&rsquo;t deserve this life anymore. I want to go and die," the paper quoted her as saying.According to Katengeza, she only&nbsp;received $4 300, which was a commission that former Malawi&rsquo;s Director of Tourism Leonard Kalonga gave her for using her company&rsquo;s bank account for money laundering.Kalonga has already been prosecuted and convicted of money laundering and is awaiting sentencing.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
