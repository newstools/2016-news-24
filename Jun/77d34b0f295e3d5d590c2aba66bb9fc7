	     Harare – The broke Zimbabwean government has offered state workers an advance payment of $100 pending the full payment next month, reports NewsDay.  According to a previous News24 report, the Zimbabwean government announced that it would delay paying June salaries for the military and police by up to two weeks.  It said other workers on the state payroll would only receive their salaries next month. This reportedly prompted the country's biggest teachers' trade union to threaten industrial action. However, as a way to avert the pending industrial action by the state workers, the government offered $100 to enable government employees to continue reporting for duty, while treasury mobilised funds to pay the remaining salary. Public Service Minister Prisca Mupfumira said that the government would offer the $100 advance to interested workers on Friday, July 1. However, trade unions said that they would be consulting with their members before accepting the offer. Government workers umbrella body, Apex Council boss Cecelia Alexander maintained that they would continue pushing for their June salaries to be paid this month.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
