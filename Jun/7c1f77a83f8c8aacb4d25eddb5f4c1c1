Concerned Quakers in the Western Cape supported the call for the state-owned land to be used for affordable family housing.They said the site could be used to narrow the &ldquo;enormous gulf&rdquo; in living conditions between families living near the city and those far out on the Cape Flats.The Western Cape circuit of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Southern Africa praised Zille&rsquo;s efforts to improve the lives of people in the province.Its dean Gerhard De Vries-Bock appealed to the government to give working class citizens the chance to live and work closer to the city&rsquo;s economic hub.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
