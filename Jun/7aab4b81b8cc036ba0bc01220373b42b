"We believe that the MEC of Education has been tasked with a mammoth responsibility to give hope not only to the [pupils] of the province but further to the populace of the province and the country, considering that this department is the biggest in the country,&rdquo; Sadtu said in a statement on Tuesday.Sadtu said the department was currently struggling to find its "true self" following disappointing matric results over the last two years, a period during which a 17% drop had been recorded in the pass rate."We hope his leadership and organising abilities will be readily put into good use through implementation of programmes designed to create a conducive learning environment," it said. &nbsp;Sadtu also added that the two former MECs had failed to ensure that educators in rural and township schools were not confronted with problems of teaching overcrowded classrooms.Putting together a good team"This is linked to annual distribution of educators which causes undue stress to educators and instability in our institutions thereby impacting negatively on learner performance. One of our key assessments for a capable MEC is their capacity to create posts for new teachers&hellip; the two MECs who came before him have failed in this front."We believe this energetic leader who has just been sworn in will be able to advance and create posts for a number of schools and ensure that the teacher to pupil ratio is further reduced."The ANC in KZN announced on Monday that it had decided to recall four of its MECs. It also said the vacant transport portfolio would be filled by Thomas Mxolisi Kaunda.Sport, Arts and Culture MEC Ntombikayise Sibhidla-Saphetha, Economic Development MEC Mike Mabuyakhulu, Education MEC Peggy Nkonyeni and Agriculture and Rural Development MEC Cyril Xaba were recalled.Themba Mthembu becomes the new Agriculture MEC, Sihle Zikalala takes over Economic Development and Bongi Sithole-Moloi moves into the sport portfolio.KZN premier Willies Mchunu, who recently replaced Senzo Mchunu, said he was trying to put together a team that would work well.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
