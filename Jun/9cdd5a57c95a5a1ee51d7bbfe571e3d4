According to New Zimbabwe, the Zanu-PF Party national commissar said that the veteran politician was far more "energetic" than his nemeses who were calling for his ouster. He said Zimbabweans voted for the nonagenarian due to his wisdom. "We don't vote for his age, but for his (Mugabe) wisdom. His age is not a secret, but we voted for what he stands for. Those with ambitions to take over from him, please stop it and let the man do his job," Kasukuwere was quoted as saying.Reports indicated that the ruling party was riddled with warring factions for time immemorial, as party leaders positioned themselves to eventually succeed the ageing Mugabe.Last week, an opposition lawmaker was cited as saying that the ruling Zanu-PF party was now split into "at least four factions".Eddie Cross of the Morgan Tsvangirai-led Movement for Democratic Change said that the&nbsp;number of cracks&nbsp;within the ruling Zanu-PF&nbsp;could not be put back together in any sort of semblance of what it used to be and no reconciliation was possible.In the past, media reports had mainly focused on two factions of the ruling party that &nbsp;were reportedly fronted by Mugabe's wife Grace and Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa. A group of Young Turks, Generation 40 (G40), was allegedly pushing for Grace to be the next deputy president, thus, positioning her to eventually succeed the ailing president.Meanwhile, the war veterans remained vocal about their&nbsp;unyielding support for vice Mnangagwa.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
