In the Western Cape, the highest number of households (93.3%) had access to adequate sanitation, followed by Gauteng with 91%. Limpopo recorded the lowest rate of access to proper sanitation, at 53.8%. However, the Western Cape reported the highest number of households still using bucket toilets, at 4%, followed by KwaZulu-Natal at 2.6%. The national figure for households that still used the bucket system was recorded at 179 134. The Household Survey showed large discrepancies between rural and urban areas, when it comes to refuse removal services. Households in urban areas were much more likely to receive some or other form of refuse removal service, whereas rural households were more likely to dispose of refuse on their own refuse dumps. The City of Johannesburg recorded the highest frequency of refuse removal (95.3%), followed by Mangaung (92.4%). Ekhurhuleni was in third place at 91.5%, with Cape Town at 90.1%. Households in Limpopo (21,4%) and the Eastern Cape (36%) were least likely to have their refuse removed at least once a week. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
