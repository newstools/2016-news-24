Xena, a 2-year-old Labrador, went missing along with her canine sibling, Cloe, at the weekend.A member of the public apparently spotted and recognised her outside a store on Monday and tried to calm and capture her.A frightened Xena ran off before the person and an inspector from Animal Welfare Helderberg could catch her.With the inspector in pursuit, Xena took a dramatic leap into the sea off-shore of Hendon Park.She was suspected to have been caught in strong rip currents, said NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon.Fishing vessel SkipJack rushed in to save the day.Cloe still missingSkipper Julian White reported that Xena, who was about 800m offshore, appeared to be exhausted.It is believed they got to her side just as she appeared to be sinking.She was brought onto the vessel with signs of hypothermia. She was also extremely agitated and panic-stricken.Reassured and wrapped in a blanket, the pooch was transferred to a sea rescue craft and brought to land.The Animal Welfare Society Gordons Bay arrived at the NSRI sea rescue base and took the dog into their care.A dog chip helped her rescuers trace her owners and they were happily reunited.It was understood that the dog had water in the lung and was being observed at the Tygerberg Animal Hospital.Cloe, a dark brindle staffy/bull terrier mix, was not chipped and is still missing.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
