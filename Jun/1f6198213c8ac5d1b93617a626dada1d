customer's bank card at a Camps Bay restaurant made his first appearance in the
Cape Town Magistrate's Court on Friday. Hawks spokesperson Captain Lloyd Ramovha confirmed that
Ishmail Sulaiman, 30, faces charges related to fraud after he was caught on a
surveillance camera skimming a man's debit card on June 7. He was arrested last week after the customer realised that
R60 000 was missing from his account after his visit to the establishment. "On review of the video footage of the affected day the
waiter is clearly seen swiping the customer's card on one… device, which he
immediately conceals in his apron, before using the other machine which
supposedly belongs to the restaurant," Ramovha said. The case was postponed to July 1 for a bail application.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
