He was not standing there and encouraging his troops... Mr Bemba was not even in the same country", defence lawyer Peter Haynes said at an ICC hearing last month. His "culpability arises from his failure to control a small fraction of his troops who were thousands of miles away".Activists warn however that a light sentence would fail to send a warning to other military commanders."It's really important that the court recognise the command responsibility .. and there's an opportunity here to provide a deterrent," said Comer, the permanent representative to the ICC for the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH)."If you knew, or you should have known, that these things were going on and you execute effective control over your troops then, yes, you're absolutely responsible for ... not preventing or punishing these crimes."The FIDH, which represents some 178 rights organisations from the around the world, is also hoping "the trial chamber will come back with a strong sentence on this in recognition of the particular devastating harm that sexual and gender-based crimes have on victims, their families and their communities at large."The landmark Bemba verdict was hailed at the time, even though many were shocked at how long it had taken for sexual violence to be focused on in an international trial.American actress Angelina Jolie urged the international community "to build on the important legal precedent" set by the Bemba case so that "we can collectively shatter impunity for the use of rape as a weapon of war and terrorism".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
