The Commission also wants to speed up readmission deals to make it easier to send migrants back.EU leaders are set to review the proposals made by the Commission, the executive arm of the 28-nation EU, at a summit in Brussels on Tuesday.They echo a controversial migration deal between the EU and Turkey signed in March.The non-governmental organisations said that the EU "risks torpedoing human rights in its foreign policy, and undermining the right to asylum internationally"."There are no safeguards envisaged to ensure that human rights, rule of law standards and protection mechanisms are in place when the EU strikes deals with governments it deems useful for stopping migration to Europe," they said."This leaves a very real risk of breach of international law which forbids push-backs to places where people are at risk of rights violations," the statement added.The mooted arrangements are inspired by a deal between the EU and Turkey that has left "thousands of people stranded in Greece in inhumane and degrading conditions", it said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
