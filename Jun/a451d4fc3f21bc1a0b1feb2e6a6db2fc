	     Nairobi - The body of a Dutch man, who had been missing for the past five months in Kenya, has been found decomposing in a septic tank. Jacobus Van Der Goes's body was found stashed in a mattress and hidden in the tank on Tuesday by investigators at his home in the coastal city of Mombasa. The Star reported that Van Der Goes, who held a Kenyan passport, had been hacked to death before he was dumped in the tank just behind his house. Murder weapons, including a hammer, were also recovered from the tank. Police were holding three suspects, among them his gardener, who was earlier arrested for being in possession of the deceased's ATM cards and other personal effects. According to Kenyans.co.ke, Van Der Goes had retired from working for the Dutch government and was living with his gardener when he was killed on January 5. The man's family are now calling on the Kenyan police to take investigations a notch higher after their relative’s decomposed body was retrieved, the report said.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
