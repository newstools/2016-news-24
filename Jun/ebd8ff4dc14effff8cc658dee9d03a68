Thulani Gqirana, News24We speak to Louisa Wynand, 21, the woman who accused suspended Western Cape ANC leader, Marius Fransman of sexual assault.WATCHCape Town &ndash; The sexual harassment case against ANC Western Cape leader Marius Fransman has been referred back to the investigating officer, National Prosecuting Agency spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku said on Tuesday.Fransman has been accused of sexually harassing 21-year-old Louisa Wynand during the party&rsquo;s January 8 celebrations.The matter was currently with the Northern Cape's Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), after the DPP in North West had earlier decided not to proceed with the case due to insufficient evidence.Mfaku said the Northern Cape DPP had some queries on the case, and had sent the docket back to the investigating officer.The Northern Cape DPP had received the docket on May 27, said Mfaku.Only once the queries were answered, would a decision be made on whether or not to prosecute, the NPA has said.He would not say whether a series of WhatsApp conversations between Fransman and Wynand formed part of the case, or the queries referred back for investigation.The Daily Maverick on Monday reported that a series of WhatsApp messages between the two had been forwarded to the NPA.The conversations ranged from work arrangements to the flirty, with Fransman advising the 21-year-old singer to bring informal "and sensual" gear on the trip.In one message, Fransman allegedly tells Wynand not to share the news of the new job with her boyfriend because we "don&rsquo;t need jealous guys around".Wynand then tells him she does not mix business with pleasure, to which Fransman allegedly replies: "Good.. but hey there will be pleasure in business?"Mfaku told News24 on Tuesday that he could not say if the WhatsApp messages were now being investigated."The issues of investigation are confidential... we need to respect that," he said.Earlier this month, Wynand told News24 that she was picking up the pieces of her life.She said, however, that she refused to back down from the case.Fransman did not respond to calls for comment on Tuesday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
