We need to treat him fairly and not prejudice him," Tshabalala told Menyiwe."We need to investigate this further, then we could gladly bring him kicking and screaming before the court of law."Cross-examination in the bail proceedings of the two men accused of killing Mafevuka was concluded on Thursday. The two accused - aged 22 and 26 - are cousins of Mafevuka's boyfriend.The 19-year-old Mafevuka was strangled and raped. Her body was discovered in a communal toilet block in Town Two on March 2.She was slumped naked over a toilet. Her clothes had been stuffed into the cistern. Water from the leaking toilet is believed to have washed DNA evidence away.Tshabalala told the court he believed the men&rsquo;s lives would be in danger should they be released on bail. "The community will take the law into their own hands," he said, citing a petition from residents demanding that the duo remain behind bars.The matter was postponed to Monday for closing arguments. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
