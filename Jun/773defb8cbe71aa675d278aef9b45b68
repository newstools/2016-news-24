According to the latest dam levels released on the assessments of 20 June, the combined average dam levels in the Western Cape increased by more than 5%.Despite this, the province s dams at the current level of 35.42% are still lower that the 59 % level at the same time last year. Even though there is a positive difference in our dam levels more rains are anticipated during this winter season. Due to the effects of the change in climate, the rainfall pattern in the Western Cape has changed. The DWS Western Cape Provincial Head, Rashid Khan, calls upon all water users to change their water use culture. We need to keep in mind that we cannot control rain, but we can control our water usage. The 20% water restrictions imposed last week will only be lifted once our dams reach a 75% capacity, says Khan. He says the department imposed the restrictions in order to improve water storage in our dams for sustainable water security. The following dams have increased by more than 5 %: Bulshoek, Voelvlei, Misvertand, Berg River, Eikenhof and Stettynskloof. As of last night, the Clanwilliam Dam was at 48%. It is important for all water users to adhere to the restrictions as stated; however, the department, working together with both provincial and local governments will continue to monitor the situation.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
