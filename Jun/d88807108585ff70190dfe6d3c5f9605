Mchunu on Monday announced he had replaced four MECs, and that Mthembu would replace Cyril Xaba in the department of agriculture. He appointed MECs Bongi Sithole Moloi (sport, arts and culture), Sihle Zikalala (economic development), and Mthandeni Dlungwana (education). Mchunu filled the vacant transport portfolio with Mxolisi Kaunda. It emerged on Tuesday afternoon that the SA Communist Party only learnt about Mthembu's deployment through the media and that Mthembu was informed about it on Monday morning. He apparently asked for 24 hours to consult with the SACP. Despite this, the ANC made the announcement. The MECs, except Mthembu, were sworn in on Tuesday. The ANC and the SACP leadership, including national second secretary, Solly Mapaila, subsequently met to discuss Mthembu’s case. They told reporters afterwards that Mthembu would accept the position conditionally. KwaZulu-Natal Judge President Achmat Jappie swore Mthembu in during an executive council meeting on Wednesday, Mchunu’s spokesperson Ndebezinhle Sibiya said. Sibiya said Zikalala, the economic development MEC, was appointed leader of government business in the province.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
