I am actually grateful for this daily reminder to pray for Muslims to come to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ and to intercede for Christian missionaries, some of whom I know personally, who are daily reaching out to Muslims &ndash; often at the risk of their lives.&ldquo;Especially with Ramadan happening 11 July through 9 August, I invite you to do the same. And why not encourage your children to also participate? Our prayers can and do make a difference!&rdquo;Shock and disgustAbramjee in his letter said he was shocked and saddened by the comments made about Muslims.&ldquo;This is offensive and it promotes racial hatred and intolerance. Furthermore, it is Islamophobic. The writer also has the dates of Ramadaan wrong and his description of the &rsquo;Azaan&rsquo; (call to prayer).&rdquo;Abramjee said the Constitution guarantees freedom of religion.&ldquo;Our Constitution guarantees us freedom of religion. Let me also remind the writer that with free speech comes responsibility. One cannot promote hatred and religious intolerance and insult other religions. His interpretation of Islam is also wrong.&rdquo;School not ready to respondAbramjee called for the &ldquo;immediate withdrawal&rdquo; of the letter and an unreserved apology to the Muslim community and others who were offended.&ldquo;You will see the outcry on social media also. Failing to retract and apologise unreservedly within 48 hours will force me to consider other options and reserve my rights.&rdquo;In his response to Abramjee, principal Maarten Geerlings said he took note of the concern.&ldquo;Since it is school holidays the earliest the school executive can meet to discuss the matter is on Monday. We will issue a statement after the meeting.&rdquo;Provincial dept condemns letterResponding to queries from News24, the Gauteng Education Department said it strongly condemned the school's behaviour.&ldquo;[The] district has been requested to investigate the matter. We would like to remind everyone that the department embraces all religions in our schools.&rdquo;The department added that it advocates religious tolerance and the importance of it.&ldquo;We always insist that our educators be aware of how important religion is in communities and also educate learners about different religions, including significant dates as outlined in the calendar. Religious education should contribute to creating an integrated and informed community that affirms unity in diversity.&rdquo;It added:&ldquo;No religious group should be dominant over or suppress others. Schools must ensure and protect the equal rights of all learners and also appreciate their right to have their religious views recognised and respected.&rdquo; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
