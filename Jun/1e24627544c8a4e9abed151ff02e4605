	        Send us your pictures   ·  Send us your stories Durban – A bogus advertisement has been posted online, appealing for funds to repair the burnt down Durban Christian Centre Jesus Dome, church officials warned on Thursday. "We don't solicit funds through social media. We collect our funds in the church and through the congregation. If people want to donate, they can contact us and we will give them our details," church spokesperson Ron Steele said. The church posted a warning on its Facebook page on Wednesday night, alerting people to the scam. "An advert we saw did not even correctly spell Durban. They put banking details that were not ours and were trying to post it on Facebook pages." The iconic Jesus Dome structure was gutted by fire on Tuesday night. Steele said the church was appalled at the manipulation of the situation. "It's shocking to see people trying to exploit any kind of misfortune, tragedy or disaster. This is inexplicable that these people behave this way. I think they need to come to the church." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
