Tammy Petersen, News24Cape Town - The well-being of the two cousins charged with the rape and murder of Sinoxolo Mafevuka could not be guaranteed should they be released on bail, the Khayelitsha Magistrate&rsquo;s Court heard on Monday.&ldquo;The accused are not safe if they are released,&rdquo; prosecutor Ndakhele Mlungwana told Magistrate Xolani Menyiwe.During closing arguments in their bail application, he said Khayelitsha residents had gone to their aunt and told her they did not want the duo in their area. She was told to demolish their shack, Mlungwana said.&ldquo;The petitions handed in also show people are shocked and outraged by the offence,&rdquo; he insisted.He referred to the more than 150 signatures the Progressive Youth Movement and the Young Girls of the SST Community had collected, calling for bail to be denied.He warned that their release could disturb public peace and order.The State had a strong prima facie case, Mlungwana continued. This included a witness who allegedly saw the two accused - cousins of Mafevuka&rsquo;s boyfriend - carrying a screaming woman towards the communal toilets in Khayelitsha Town Two before her murder in the early hours of March 2.The 19-year-old was strangled. Her naked body was found slumped over a toilet. Her clothes had been stuffed into the cistern. Water from the leaking toilet is believed to have washed DNA evidence away.Earlier, defence lawyer Thabo Nogemane argued that the State's evidence against his clients - aged 22 and 26 - was of such poor quality that no court could accept it.He told Menyiwe his clients should be released and that police start looking for &ldquo;the real perpetrators who are still at large".Judgment would be delivered on Friday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
