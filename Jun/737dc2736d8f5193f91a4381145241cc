Bloemfontein – The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries on Friday warned pig owners to be vigilant after two cases of African Swine Flu (ASF) were confirmed in the North West and Free State. One case was discovered in a communal set-up in Ipelegeng township near Schweizer Reneke in North West and another one on a farm near Koffiefontein in the Free State, the department said in a statement. "In both cases a large number of pigs started showing signs suspicious of the disease and the vets were called out to investigate," it said. "Samples were collected and submitted to the ARC OVI [Agricultural Research Council Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute] since African swine fever is always on the top of the suspect list." However, it said the two cases seem likely not to be related. "Contact between wild pigs and domestic pigs should be avoided as the disease readily transmits between infected pigs…domestic pigs are highly susceptible and most of the infected pigs will show severe haemorrhagic symptoms and will die soon after contracting ASF." It added that a small proportion of animals may survive and will carry the ASF virus for a few months without any signs of disease, but with the ability to infect in-contact pigs. "If the disease gets into the wild pig population, we may end up with an endemic situation being created, which will result in outbreaks being reported periodically and affecting trade of pigs and pig products from the country."
