As the vets began work on it, what looked like grey pus came oozing out. In fact it was "white pus flecked with bits of black dead bone," Dutlow explained.Some of the fragments of bone that had to be dug out were pretty large - as long as 8cm across and 3cm wide.'It was amazing'Whoever shot Pretty Boy "must have been aiming straight for his head", Marabini added.&nbsp;The wound was flushed out and the elephant has been given long-lasting antibiotics. "I don't think the bullet (which is still lodged inside) will cause any more problems," Marabini added.As in the case of Ben, the bull elephant which came to a lodge on Lake Kariba looking for help with his wound at the end of last month, Pretty Boy seems to have understood that some humans might want to help him.Vets and anyone who's helped dart big animals know they have to be particularly wary of them the day after they've been darted in case they decide to attack.But in Pretty Boy's case on Tuesday, he showed "no signs of aggression whatsoever", Marabini said.The elephant placidly allowed them and a local guide to walk right up to him."It was amazing," the vet said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
