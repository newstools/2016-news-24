Cape Town â€“ Mystery surrounds the fall of a man from a
moving train in Brackenfell as no witnesses have come forward to confirm he was
pushed. Paramedics assisted the 40-year-old man as he lay next to
the tracks, near the Brackenfell train station, on Tuesday. He sustained serious injuries to his legs and one of his
arms. His friend apparently witnessed him being thrown from the
train and alerted paramedics, according to ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring. Metrorail said initial reports were that fellow commuters
alerted rail security guards to a person falling from the train's open doors. The guards then summoned emergency services. "Metrorail has not received any statements nor have any
witnesses come forward to indicate that he had been thrown from the train by
another party," said regional spokesperson Riana Scott. Western Cape police spokesperson FC van Wyk said they had no
record of the incident. Scott said they were unfortunately unable to offer more
information until further investigation by police "revealed the facts
around the incident".
