But at the AZ Damiaan hospital in Ostend, he can accompany visitors to the department they are looking for, said Raphal Tassart of Belgian firm Zora Bots which developed the software inside his robot brain.Robots like Pepper, whose components come from Asia but are assembled in France, have already been tested in Japanese shops and a few large French malls, generally carrying out retail functions."But it's the first time that they will be used in reception," said the spokesperson.Another line of smaller robots made by the same company, the 57cm-tall Nao, have already been deployed in about 300 hospitals and retirement or care homes around the world.In Liege and Ostend, they are used as a support tool in the paediatric and geriatric departments.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
