With her hands bound tightly by belts, the pressure of the pillow over her face leaving her with no oxygen, and a screwdriver held to her throat, Irene van Tonder (71) thought she had only seconds to live.&ldquo;Listen to what I say. If you remember my face, or tell anyone, I will push this screwdriver right into your throat,&rdquo; said her attacker.What was supposed to be a pleasant trip to visit her granddaughter and son turned into a nightmare when the Lady&shy;smith resident and a domestic worker were brutally attacked in her son&rsquo;s Ashburton home yesterday morning.&ldquo;It was 7.30 am. I was watching TV from a chair in the dining room while the domestic worker was tidying up the lounge,&rdquo; said Van Tonder. &ldquo;I saw two men storm into the lounge from the back of the house and grab her. She turned and looked at me with such fear and I tried to make a run for the door.&rdquo;Van Tonder said one of the men grabbed her, hitting her hard across the face, sending her &ldquo;flying across the room&rdquo;.&ldquo;He pushed me down into the lounge chair, and bound my hands and legs with belts,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Then he pushed a pillow down over my face. He was suffocating me. He shoved the screwdriver against my throat.&rdquo;Van Tonder said the man told her to do everything they said and if she did not, they would kill her.&ldquo;I was afraid for my life. I thought this was it. I thought they were going to kill me,&rdquo; she said.Van Tonder said the two men started screaming at her, asking were the money and guns were kept.&ldquo;The one man stayed with me while the other tied up the domestic worker and made her show him where things were in the house. I told them we didn&rsquo;t keep any guns and they told me I was lying. They even climbed up into the ceiling to look for firearms.&rdquo;She said the man who had threatened her with a screwdriver demanded her cellphone.&ldquo;I told him I did not have one, and just then, my cellphone rang.&ldquo;I thought that would be the end for me. He shouted that I was a liar and kept on searching the house.&rdquo;Van Tonder said the men stole her son&rsquo;s television, the radio, all his hiking boots, her grandchildren&rsquo;s bicycles, clothes and the gold chain her late husband had left her.&ldquo;They even stole food,&rdquo; she said.Van Tonder said although there were only two men in the house, one of the robbers kept going outside to talk to someone.&ldquo;I told them that my son had gone to the shops and was coming back soon and I think that scared them.&ldquo;Every second felt like an hour. It was the most terrible thing I have ever been through.&rdquo;After what seemed like hours but may have only been a few minutes, the men left.&ldquo;I heard them leave and counted to 15. I untied myself and then untied the domestic worker who they had left in my son&rsquo;s room.&ldquo;I told her to open the gate for me and I ran down the road screaming for help.&rdquo;Two farmers from next door immediately rushed out, calling for police and an ambulance.&ldquo;As soon as the ambulance arrived, I went into cardiac arrest and was rushed to Edendale Hospital.&rdquo;Van Tonder said she was &ldquo;so grateful to be alive&rdquo;, adding she had never prayed so hard as she did during the attack.&ldquo;They were very organised. They knew what they were doing and what they were looking for.&ldquo;I am just lucky to be alive,&rdquo; she said.Van Tonder said the robbers appeared to be between the ages of 19 and 22 and police had taken finger prints from the house.&ldquo;I know there will be patrols here for the next few nights by a security company after today [yesterday],&rdquo; she said.Head of KwaZulu-Natal Agricultural Union (KwaNalu) security desk Koos Marais said those living in remote areas needed to ensure they took the necessary safety precautions.&ldquo;It can happen to anyone and people need to know that anyone is a target.&rdquo;Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson Sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese said a case of robbery had been opened at Alexandra Road police station. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
