Most of the recent attacks on oil facilities in the oil-rich south have been claimed by the NDA, who want a fairer share of revenue from the sector for local people.President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered enhanced security in the delta as NDA sabotage of pipelines and attacks on installations have reduced crude production to 1.4 million barrels per day.The emergence of militant outfits recalls the situation in the 2000s, when groups with broadly similar aims came together under the MEND banner.The rebels were bought off in the government-brokered amnesty deal but Buhari's initial announcement to wind down the programme by 2018 is said to have contributed to the re-emergence of militancy.NDA rebels are also thought to be sympathetic to the prominent former MEND leader Government "Tompolo" Ekpemupolo, who is wanted on multi-million dollar corruption charges.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
