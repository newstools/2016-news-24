We would not like a former head of state answering a case at the International Criminal Court over the death penalty," Kaliati was quoted as saying. Kalindo's utterances marked a renewed call for the death penalty, with several members of parliament having shown support for the motion.Madalitso Kazombo, a member of the opposition Malawi Congress Party, had previously said that a proposal would be tabled in Parliament in order to strengthen the penal code and allow for the death sentences to be handed down.According to a Malawi24 report, President Peter Mutharika had already indicated his unwillingness to bring back the death penalty, saying, that a special penalty need not be stipulated."We already have the death penalty in our penal codes, we do not need a special one to use to target anyone who kills albinos," Mutharika was quoted as saying. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
