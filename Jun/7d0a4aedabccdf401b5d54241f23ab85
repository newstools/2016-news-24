His statements come after police shot and killed two wanted suspects on Monday in Helpmekaar, Dundee. Langa advised criminals to rather surrender and not shoot at police. &ldquo;They [should] rather surrender if [cornered] by the members because police will defend themselves if attacked by the criminals."Langa added that the recovered firearms from the suspects would be sent for ballistic tests to determine if they were used in any other crimes in the province.Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said Helpmekaar police, assisted by Glencoe K9 members, conducted an operation in the area tracing the suspects who were wanted for murder, rape, house robberies and armed robberies respectively. &ldquo;The members were following information about the whereabouts of two suspects.
