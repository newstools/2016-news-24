Education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwane visited the Prince Tokotoko High School in Nongoma on Tuesday morning, spokesperson Muzi Mahlambi said. &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;The teacher was not at school and the principal tried to deny the allegations, but the school governing body told us that even last year they had to intervene in a similar situation. "This proves that there might have been many incidents at the school that were never recorded." The footage, posted on Facebook, shows the teacher holding what appears to be a stick or a pipe. She summons the teenage girls to the front of the class, positions each of them behind a chair and hits each girl several times. Mahlambi hoped the suspension would serve as a lesson to other teachers in the province who were still using corporal punishment. &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
