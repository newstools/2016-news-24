Durban – "I found him, I found him!" These were the words of relief from Solly Mokoetle's wife, Zola Ntuli, on Wednesday morning. Ntuli was speaking at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital after she found her husband, who went missing on Friday. "He is alive, I think he fell because he has a cut on his head. I think someone found him and took him to the hospital, we are at the Ghandi Hospital but I am taking him to a private hospital." Ntuli said she was relieved that the father of her four children was alive. "I am actually shaking in relief, I am in awe of God’s miracle. The thought that he had died crossed my mind and I thought to myself how could such a responsible person do that." She said the police were alerted on Tuesday that Mokoetle was in hospital. The former SABC boss went missing when he left his Mount Edgecombe home for a walk, but never returned home. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Shooz Magudulela confirmed to News24 that Mokoetle was in hospital. "Solly Mokoetle was found... in one of the hospitals in Durban. He was reported missing on Saturday," Magudulela said on Wednesday.
