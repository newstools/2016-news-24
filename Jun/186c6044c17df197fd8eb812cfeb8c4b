Jenni Evans, News24 Cape Town - DA leader Mmusi Maimane dismissed suggestions that his predecessor Helen Zille had to step in to convince the party's Eastern Cape chairperson Veliswa Mvenya to retract her resignation. Mvenya, who resigned in May, had since retracted her resignation. "Really, you can't dream up more nonsense than that," Maimane said during a briefing on the party's candidate lists for the August 3 elections. The party wants to win the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro, which includes Port Elizabeth, and unseat the African National Congress, but Mvenya's sudden resignation put a spanner in the works. Maimane said that Mvenya resigned of her own accord during a personal crisis, which he would not go into. "That is her right," he said. "It is disingenuous to say that Helen Zille convinced her to retract," he said. Zille, who is now Western Cape premier, was leader of the party until Maimane was elected to the position in May 2015. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
