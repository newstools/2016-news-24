Teachers are supposed to be monitoring and mentoring our children against wrongdoing, but this time it happens that one of those mentors is feeding our children with drugs," he said.Nhlabathi said the teacher, Mduduzi Dlamini, appeared in the Standerton Magistrate's Court on charges of drug dealing.He has not been asked to plead and has been released on R3 000 bail.The accused would appear in court on August 19. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
