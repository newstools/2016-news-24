Duct tape was used to keep her mouth shut.She was dragged along by a chain while another powerful dog was set on her. The dog was used as bait in three training fights on one day.&ldquo;When she was so injured and weak that she was of no further use to the callous dog fighters, they let her final attacker maul her to death.&ldquo;To the NSPCA she is a symbol of the horrendous so-called training process and the lifetime of suffering of all dogs forced into the criminal world of dog fighting in whatever way,&rdquo; Hansa said.WATCH this video here.
