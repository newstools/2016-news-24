Lynn.HitchcockTHE former Greytown Mayor, Councillor Petros Ngubane has expressed considerable concern about the ongoing misuse and abuse by Umvoti Municipality of municipal assets and ratepayers money. In a statement this week to the Greytown Gazette, he stated: The appointment by Umvoti Mayor T. Ngubane of security guards from a private company, which is said to be costing over R100 000 a month - paid for by ratepayers. Then the still unanswered queries in regard to the R23 million worth of equipment bought last year - 75% of which is still standing unused in the engineer s yard. Council had agreed that tenders for this equipment be processed for the equipment to be bought direct from the dealer. However, it was bought from a private company and no documentation has been produced for this tender. It was also short-delivered - with one truck not been delivered. Councillor Ngubane states that despite continuous requests to the municipal manager and the mayor as to who actually ordered this equipment and who signed for the incorrect delivery, no response had been given by either the mayor or the MM.The former mayor continues in his press statement to query the use of municipal funds for political party campaigning. The Mayor [Councillor Thami Ngubane] organised soccer matches at Mbuba using municipal assets, staff and money and supplied water tanks to Makhabaleni Ward 6 without the involvement of the ward councillor, as well as Ward 2 and the new Ward 13 - clearly political campaigning for his party - no reference to Exco or Council to do this. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
