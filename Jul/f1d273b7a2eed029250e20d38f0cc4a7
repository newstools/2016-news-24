The East African country is one of the most successful nations in middle and long distance running in the world and recently faced a ban for not enacting anti doping legislation, which was finally passed by President Uhuru Kenyatta in late June after fears the country could miss out on the upcoming Rio Olympic Games.Watch video below24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
