The group, numbering less than 10, chanted and carried placards demanding answers from the police. Right2Know spokesperson Thabane Miya said that members of their campaign stood in solidarity with the affected community. "We are launching a national campaign to show our solidarity with the people of Glebelands Hostel. Sixty-four people have died at the hostels so we are here to demand from the police to tell us what transpired," Miya said.According to the campaign, an estimated 64 people have been killed at the hostel in the past two years.Miya&nbsp;said that, along with answers from the police, they wanted a report by Public Protector Thuli Madonsela made public. "We also want the report that hasn't been released to the public. We want to know the role of the police, specifically the role of the crime intelligence unit. They earn a lot of money and they pay informers and they are supposed to know about crimes before they happen," he said.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
