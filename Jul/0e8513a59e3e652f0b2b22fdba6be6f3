Provincial secretary Thandu&shy;xolo Sabelo said the hospital &ldquo;remains the most untransformed&rdquo; in the province.&ldquo;We have learnt with shock that Northdale Hospital, one of the biggest hospitals in our region, is a nest of barbaric, dehumanised, and un-rehabilitated racist practitioners. &ldquo;It is distasteful that white, Indian and coloured doctors, when called in to give medical attention to patients, first ask the race of the patient. If the patient is white, Indian or coloured, they attend promptly, but if the patient is black African they delay or end up even not coming,&rdquo; he said.Sabelo said black African patients were subjected to long lines at the hospital while other races were allowed to cut the queues. &ldquo;Africans have opted to sleep on benches to be the first ones to get medical attention the following day.&rdquo;Sabelo said the hospital had systematically excluded black employees from the strategic running of the hospital. He also demanded that the Health Department probe allegations of corruption at the hospital. Health Department spokesperson Sam Mkhwanazi accepted the memorandum, which he said would be handed over to the department head to look at. The hospital was given a month to respond or face more pickets and mass action. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
