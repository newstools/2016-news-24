	     Cape Town - Three children were shot and wounded on Thursday in Bonteheuwel, just metres from where a memorial service was being held for slain train driver Piet Botha. The memorial service took place on the platform at Netreg Station at 11:00 on Thursday. Botha, 46, was killed while conducting a training session on the platform with a younger driver on Monday. Moments after his memorial service concluded on Thursday, shots were heard coming from the road parallel to the station in Bonteheuwel. According to numerous eyewitnesses, a blue Citi Golf with five occupants pulled up to a house on the corner of the road. One person reportedly got out and fired shots in the direction of the house. Three children who had been playing outside the house were wounded. Police arrived round 20 minutes later and started tending to the victims. Four police cars and eight policemen surrounded the property around 12:30 and sealed off the area from the gathering crowd. Emergency medical services had still not arrived at the time of writing. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
