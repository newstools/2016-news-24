Brigadier General Abdel-Razek al-Nadhouri on Monday warned foreign companies against signing oil deals with any party except for the state-run National Oil Corporation branch in Benghazi. Libya's oil corporation has been split between eastern and western branches. Benghazi's branch falls under the authority of the internationally-recognised parliament seated in the eastern city of Tobruk. The western one falls under the UN-brokered government based in Tripoli. Al-Nadhouri's move came days after UN Envoy to Libya, Martin Kobler, came to an agreement with militia leader Ibrahim Jedran, who controls Libya's vital oil terminals. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
