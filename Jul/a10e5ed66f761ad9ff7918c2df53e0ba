	     New Delhi - Prime Minister Narendra Modi will travel to Africa next week, New Delhi said on Friday, seeking to boost India's influence on a continent where rival Asian power China enjoys significant clout. India has been working to improve ties with African nations as it vies for a greater share of the continent's natural resources. Its economic presence in Africa is dwarfed by that of China, whose trade with the continent topped $200bn last year - more than the GDP of the 30 smallest African economies combined. Modi will arrive in Mozambique on July 7 before heading to South Africa for a two-day visit, the Indian foreign ministry announced. He will also visit Tanzania and Kenya. His visit follows a major summit last October that saw around 50 African heads of state converge on the Indian capital. "The visit of the PM to the African mainland reflects India's desire to further strengthen and reinvigorate bilateral ties with our African partners which were renewed at the India-Africa Forum Summit," said ministry spokesperson Vikas Swarup. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
