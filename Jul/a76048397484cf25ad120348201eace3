Sanco spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu on Saturday slammed the incident which took place earlier this week in Conville in which two people sustained severe burn wounds and a third escaped."Mob justice will only lead to lawlessness and a vicious cycle of violence," he said in a statement.He appealed to locals to assist police in their investigations instead of taking the law into their own hands."Urgent action needs to be taken to restore the confidence of communities in accountable and democratic community policing to address mob justice incidents that appear to be on the increase," he said.Mahlangu said that vigilantism created a cycle of violence that undermines the rule of law, but added that quicker police response to distress calls, increased visibility and regular investigation progress updates to crime victims &ldquo;will contribute towards restoring confidence in the criminal justice system&rdquo;.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
