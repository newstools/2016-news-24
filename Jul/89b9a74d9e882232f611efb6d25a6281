Good street lighting is a proven way to deter criminal activity, says Chas Everitt International franchise co-owner Greg Walton, and that s the thinking behind our Beacon of Light project .The project installs solar-powered street lights in local areas to enhance safety. These lights work really well and because they require no electricity connection, they can be installed quickly and easily wherever we have permission to do so. Several lights have been installed so far and Hout Bay residents are now being asked to make further suggestions about where they are needed most bearing in mind that they may not be erected on private land. We have certainly had a great response so far, says Walton, and we are now also working with the local neighbourhood watch groups and encouraging other companies to join us in sponsoring the lights so that we can expand the campaign and light up Hout Bay even faster.
