The soup kitchen is run every Monday and provides meals for those who live on the street. On Monday the Fever saw people going to the church s soup kitchen, and then leaving with bags of clothing, which they were given because they had nothing else. We have a number of people coming to the church for the soup kitchen every Monday. The ladies running the boutique are doing a great job with the support of church members, said Joey Du Toit, the soup kitchen assistant.Mersia van Aswegen and Aletta Naude are responsible for the boutique, which is open every day.The boutique and soup kitchen work together in assisting those who live on the street. At times we get people coming to the soup kitchen for the first time and they have nothing, so we give them items from the boutique, said Du Toit.The boutique women also collect soap and cosmetics to give to the street people.Du Toit said they also have bags of items which they sell for R10 each, which the street people buy and then sell as some form of income. The community can assist the boutique by buying and donating items.For more information, phone the church at 039 682 0266. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
