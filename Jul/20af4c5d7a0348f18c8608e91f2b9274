Two of the intruders were shot dead, and a security guard had to receive treatment in the trauma unit after being shot in the leg."A nurse was also assaulted while walking from the matron's office to the transport department."Police found&nbsp;one body at the hospital and another was discovered at the Congella Park sports field.Dhlomo said: "This is a very unfortunate and unnecessary incident. I would like to once again urge any aggrieved individuals to desist from perpetrating acts of violence, and instead follow the appropriate channels, using recognised labour formations, to air their grievances."We also wish to call upon law enforcement authorities to work to ensure that people who break the law, or those behind acts of sabotage, are apprehended and made to face the full might of the law."The department said no patients had to be evacuated&nbsp;because of&nbsp;the incident.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
