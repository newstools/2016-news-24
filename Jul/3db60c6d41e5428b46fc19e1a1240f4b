I had to jump over the fence because in their panic, they could not find the key for the gate,&rdquo; the neighbour said.&ldquo;I found him in a pool of blood. Your first instinct is to try and revive someone but there was so much blood everywhere. I did not sleep all night with those images in my head.&rdquo; When The Witness visited the scene yesterday, another neighbour said Mhlana&rsquo;s father, who is also the owner of the house, had taken his family and the other tenants to the Eastern Cape. It is believed Mhlana and his relative are originally from the Eastern Cape and were living in Pietermaritzburg, with other tenants at the house, to study. The neighbour said the community was left traumatised and saddened by the incident as they had seen Mhlana frequently walking up and down their street. He described Mhlana and his murder-accused relative as &ldquo;pretty decent young adults&rdquo;. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
