She is being freed from prison this evening," her lawyer Caroline Wassermann said in Paris.Yen-Ayoum was arrested along with several others in an anti-corruption sweep. Most of those arrested said they were the victims of a political witch-hunt. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
