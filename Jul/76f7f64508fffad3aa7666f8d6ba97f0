They later found his body at his home on Mistly Farm.It is believed that the attack took place last Sunday evening after the men cut through the perimeter fence."The timeline of events is unclear, however, it appears that after Theron was stabbed, he managed to escape his attackers, locking himself in the house where he bandaged up his leg," said Buffalo Security head, Roger Scheffer, earlier this week.Scheffer said it was believed that the men then broke down the door and went into the house where they allegedly strangled Theron before ransacking the house completely.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
