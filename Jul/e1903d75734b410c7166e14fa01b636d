Once completed, the scheme was expected to stabilize the water supply for approximately 15 years, according to current growth projections in the region. The department was procuring mobile desalination plants at a cost of R350m. These would be used to produce clean, drinkable water until the scheme had been upgraded. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
