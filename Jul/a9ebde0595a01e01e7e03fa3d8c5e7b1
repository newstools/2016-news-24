He left the country using his Irish passport on five occasions in 2015 and once in 2016.Roux pointed out that O&rsquo;Sullivan was the first person ever to be charged under the act.He asked Mangqalaza what other cases he had investigated against O&rsquo;Sullivan.&lsquo;Spy tapes&rsquo;The ex-policeman said he was part of a team investigating O&rsquo;Sullivan for fraud in a case opened by SAA.When prompted by Roux, Mangqalaza told the court about a third case which he described as &ldquo;spy tapes&rdquo;. These were intercepted phone recordings which O&rsquo;Sullivan emailed to the police and members of the public.Mangqalaza did not want to go into any further detail on the case.The Star reported in June that the Hawks were questioning journalists and police officers about &ldquo;lawful Act 70 interceptions&rdquo;.The questioning related to a media conference and email&rsquo;s O&rsquo;Sullivan had sent alleging that now retired head of detectives, Lieutenant-General Vinesh Moonoo, was involved in corruption. O&rsquo;Sullivan distributed voice recordings of Moonoo allegedly talking to suspected underworld figures.Moonoo denied all the allegations.Roux tried to get Mangqalaza to mention Moonoo&rsquo;s name, but was unsuccessful.Prosecutor Jabulani Mlotshwa objected, saying the case was still under investigation and sub judice.&ldquo;It is still under investigation and goes to the heart of security in this country,&rdquo; Mlotshwa said.&lsquo;Corrupt&rsquo; senior officersRoux moved on, asking Mangqalaza if the arrest had been done in order to stop O&rsquo;Sullivan from attending a press conference in London, something he had promised to do in an email he sent to the police.&ldquo;I will be calling a full blown press conference in Whitehall, London in order to expose the corrupt regime of Zupta-run criminals,&rdquo; the email read.Roux said the email was spoken about in an interrogation of O&rsquo;Sullivan after his arrest. Gauteng head of the Hawks General Prince Mokotedi was present.The advocate said O&rsquo;Sullivan was interrogated on everything but 26B, and the Hawks offered to give him bail if he would give them the information he had on corruption allegations against senior police officers.Mangqalaza denied knowing anything.&ldquo;That email was raised and he [O&rsquo;Sullivan] was told he would be charged with treason because of it. You were there,&rdquo; Roux said.Mangqalaza denied knowing about the email.&ldquo;This whole section 26B arrest was all designed to stop him from going to the UK to have the press conference,&rdquo; Roux said. &ldquo;The first attempt to stop him from going was to get a warrant for the SAA matter, but that was unsuccessful.&rdquo;Roux then asked why O&rsquo;Sullivan was taken to Pretoria Central police station and not Kempton Park police station or even to Durban, since the investigating officer in the SAA matter, a Colonel Hoosen, was from Durban.&ldquo;Why was Hoosen there, searching him if he was involved in the SAA matter? I will put it to you, you guys, about 15 of you [Hawks officers], desperately wanted to stop the accused from going to the UK to stop him from going to a press conference,&rdquo; Roux said.&ldquo;So 15 Hawks officers, some very senior, all came to arrest someone for an offence nobody had been charged with before.&rdquo;Mangqalaza repeated that all he knew was that he had arrested O&rsquo;Sullivan for contravening 26B and knew nothing more.The cross-examination continued. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
