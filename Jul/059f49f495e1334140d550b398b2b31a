Le Roux Steyn, 21, his sister Marcelle, 18, and Christiaan Kruger applied for bail in the Krugersdorp Magistrate’s Court last month. Their co-accused, Fabian Luff, did not apply for bail. Kruger and the siblings previously claimed in court that police abused them in custody. Kruger alleged a police officer hit him in the face while another tied a plastic bag around his head and told him they would suffocate him "like he suffocated the victims". Steyn said in his affidavit that police placed a gas mask over his head and that he couldn't breathe. In her affidavit, Marcelle said police threatened to rape her and tied her to a chair. All three indicated they would plead not guilty. Estate agent Hanlie Lategan, 52, was found dead next to a stream on a farm in Elandsvlei, Randfontein, on Tuesday, May 31. She went missing the previous day after going to meet clients. The bodies of insurance brokers Anthony Scholefield, 64, and Kevin McAlpine, 29, were found in the boots of their cars in the same area on May 10 and 26. All three victims had scheduled appointments with clients.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
