The AU is 76% funded by donors, &ldquo;or what we euphemistically call partners&rdquo;, Dlamini-Zuma said. She said the new model of requiring member states to contribute 0.2% of their import levies to the body would bring it a &ldquo;step closer to dignity&rdquo;. At the opening ceremony Dlamini-Zuma also handed over the new African passport to AU chairperson, Chad president Idriss D&eacute;by, who kissed the passport with a giggling Dlamini-Zuma looking on.&nbsp; He then shook her hand for longer than was strictly necessary.&nbsp; The launch of the passport was mostly symbolic, and member states were tasked to go back and work out the logistics of producing these.&nbsp; Government leaders and diplomats would be the first to get these passports, and Rwandan president Paul Kagame, whose country was hosting the mid-year summit, was the first to get a passport.&nbsp; Dlamini-Zuma received praise from various speakers, with the Pan-African Youth presenting her with its peace award. The heads of state were locked in a closed caucus meeting all of Sunday morning debating on the United Nations Security Council reforms, and they are expected to elect a new AU Commission chairperson later in the day.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
