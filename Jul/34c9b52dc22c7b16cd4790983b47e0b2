The scourge of racism and even sexism still characterises human relations across the world. If we can defeat racism here in South Africa, we will be sending a message that would light a candle that can be shared throughout the world,&rdquo; he said.National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams said criminalising racism would not be easy. However, they viewed it in a serious light and were deeply concerned about the recent spate of racist activities.&ldquo;It's clearly the result of an intolerable nation and people need to learn to be more tolerant of each other. Each person needs to do a great deal of self-reflection. We need to look deep into ourselves as people and treat the next person the way we want to be treated,&rdquo; he said.Abrahams said each case should be evaluated on its own merits. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
