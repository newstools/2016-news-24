The Hawks arrested Malusi Norrison Kuzwayo, 34, in Umhlanga following a long investigation, spokesperson Captain Lloyd Ramovha said on Saturday.&ldquo;He is accused of being part of a countrywide syndicate that presents falsified documents to banks for bond applications and other credit facilities, including vehicles,&rdquo; he confirmed.It is alleged that Kuzwayo fraudulently acquired two properties in Gordons Bay and Constantia between 2006 and 2007, valued at just under R10m.He appeared in the Durban Specialised Commercial Court on Friday and the matter was transferred to Cape Town, where he will appear on Monday.Ramovha said Kuzwayo faces almost a dozen charges for contravening the Prevention of Organised Crime Act, and the possibility of more charges being added cannot be ruled out.&ldquo;Disturbingly there's a growing phenomenon of ordinary people agreeing to opening bank accounts for fraud syndicates using their details. They are then paid a certain fee for their accounts to be used to channel and withdraw criminal proceeds,&rdquo; Ramovha said.He warned those involved will also face criminal charges for complicity to the original crime even if they claim ignorance to it.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
