I am tired of the running around trying to get answers from the municipal department responsible for the project. The last response I received was when ward councillor Richard Nyembezi and I went to the municipality together and we were told that a builder will be sent to check the house and they will complete it that month, said Ndlovu. Ndlovu said the builder came to see the house and suggested that the house be demolished as the windows and material used was old and damaged and said they would have to rebuild the house from scratch. Ward councillor Richard Nyembezi said the issue with the house is that it was not built correctly, so an application was sent by the municipal housing department for funding to demolish the house and rebuild. We are busy with Zinhle s problem. The municipality has informed me that an application was made to housing and there has been funding issues for the house to be rebuilt. We are trying to resolve the issue as fast as we can, said Nyembezi.Hibiscus Coast Municipality Mayor Cllr Nomusa Mqwebu questioned who had built the house, the municipality or Department of Transport as the house is situated next to the road.No further comment was given by HCM on the issue. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
