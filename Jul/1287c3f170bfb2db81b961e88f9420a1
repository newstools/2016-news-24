Cape Town - Metrorail drivers have gone on strike after a colleague was shot dead at the Netreg station on Monday, the railway operator said in a statement. “We apologise for not being able to offer a full service at the moment, but it is crucial that we reassure Metrorail employees that they can work in safety,” regional manager Richard Walker said. Netreg was located in a gang-infested area and drivers had the unenviable task of working in such a volatile environment. He said crime in areas where Metrorail operated needed decisive action from law enforcement agencies. The operator offered its condolences to the man’s family. “Our hearts go out to his family who must face the loss of a husband and father. His death is an enormous blow to his family and his colleagues,” Walker said.
