Her naked body was found slumped over a toilet.Her clothes had been stuffed into the cistern. Water from the leaking toilet is believed to have washed DNA evidence away.The magistrate has ordered that the cousins not be named for their safety.The case has been postponed to August 19. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
