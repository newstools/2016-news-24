Tembisa - Paramedics say three people have been injured after the roof of Phumulani Mall in Tembisa collapsed due to a heavy storm. “Initially reports were received that several people were trapped under the rubble. However, upon a scene assessment, emergency workers only found three people with minor injuries,” ER24 spokesperson Werner Vermaak said. It is believed their injuries were caused by falling debris. "Paramedics and rescue workers found debris scattered across the parking lot of the mall as well as twisted metal strewn at the entrance of the mall. Several vehicles were also damaged." Vermaak added that fire and rescue teams conducted a full search of the area to ensure no one else was trapped. At this stage the teams have not found anyone else injured. Earlier on Tuesday afternoon the mall's spokesperson, Godfrey Mashakgomo, said several people were injured when the roof collapsed during the storm. At the time, it was not known how many people were injured.
