He's a vocal advocate for religious reforms and often argued that some texts of interpretation by historic Islamic scholars - including ones upheld and revered by Al-Azhar, the pre-eminent seat of Sunni scholarship - contain passages that promote extremism.The ruling is the latest in a rash of cases cracking down on freedom of expression in the Arab world's most populous country.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
