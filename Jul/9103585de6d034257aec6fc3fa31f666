Lizeka Tandwa, News24Johannesburg - Church leaders who endorse political parties are like the Dutch Reformed Church which supported the apartheid government, the SA Council of Churches said on Monday."It's an unorthodox theological position. Maybe it has to do with how one understands God," SACC general secretary Bishop Malusi Mpumlwana said.He was speaking after Bishop John Bolana of the Bantu Church of Christ told his followers during a sermon on Sunday: "God has handpicked Nelson Mandela Bay's ANC mayoral candidate Danny Jordaan to rise up in the fight for the city. "If Nelson Mandela Metro falls into the hands of the enemy, there would be suffering on a biblical scale," he said. Mpumlwana said during apartheid, the Dutch Reformed Church had endorsed the view that God gave the land to white South Africans, along with the responsibility to govern. "Some people may say, yes, God does that, but I'm not sure it says every ruler is God-chosen," Mpumlwana told News24.The SACC distanced itself from churches that endorsed political parties. It would not endorse any political party as it would be providing support to the Electoral Commission of SA (IEC) during the local government elections on August 3.The SACC would provide observers at voting stations, peace monitors, and mediators, should the need arise. The peace monitors would include senior clerics who would watch out for flare-ups of violence.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
