Critics accused the government of selling off the islands. The government says that the islands belong to Saudi Arabia and Egypt had only been protecting them since 1950.One of the 10 was sentenced in absentia, while all were fined $10 000 on Thursday. The decision came weeks after rights lawyers won a court order striking down the Island transfer, in a public rebuke of Sisi.
