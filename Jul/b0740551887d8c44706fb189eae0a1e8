Jeanette Chabalala, News24Bloemfontein &ndash; Two men are recovering in hospital following a vicious attack by two pit bulls in Heidedal in Bloemfontein earlier this week. According to one of the victims, Audi Williams, he and his friend, Gregory Kamver, were sitting by the fire when they heard a loud scream on Tuesday night."We rushed to find out what was happening and when we got there, we found two dogs attacking a man. He was lying on the ground busy screaming. One dog attacked his arm, while another dog attacked his leg," he said. Fabian May was apparently on his way back from work when the dogs attacked him, Williams said.He said when they had tried to save May, but the two dogs turned on them. "One of the dogs left the man and then jumped on me and the other dog attacked my friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;The dogs attacked us and Kamver jumped on top of a car and his leg was injured. I was not admitted to hospital, but I am still in pain." Kamver, 40 and May, 32, were admitted to the Pelonomi Private Hospital in Bloemfontein following the attack. Williams said they were considering taking legal action against the owner. May&rsquo;s aunt said she was shocked when she heard the news. "This is the same route that he uses everyday and he said he doesn&rsquo;t know where the dogs come from. We are just happy he is recovering now," she said. &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
