"It is a decision that risks returning the SABC to the dark old days of apartheid, where the institution that is supposed to be a public broadcaster was used as a mouthpiece of the then government."'Sanitising the news'Sanef said the broadcaster had failed to prove that airing visuals of violent protests encouraged others to do the same, and also questioned&nbsp;the SABC's comparison to that of publishing pictures and footage of dead bodies."The two are not the same. Editors across the country continue to take decisions on graphic pictures every single day, guided by the spirit of public interest."The SABC should be guided by the Broadcast Complaints Commission of South Africa on publishing or broadcasting pictures and footage that could fall under 'gratuitous violence'."The decision to completely ban footage amounted to sanitising the news, the group concluded.The SABC has been given seven days from Monday to respond to Icasa's ruling.- FULL TEXT: Icasa's ruling against the SABC24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
