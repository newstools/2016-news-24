Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique have all issued drought alerts in recent months, as thousands of cattle die, reservoirs shrink and harvests fail.Critical pointPakkala said the situation had been worsened by the timing of the drought, which hit as the economies of many of the affected countries were struggling."We are at a critical point," said CARE regional director Emma Naylor-Ngugi."People are being pushed to the brink... unless donors provide more funding, millions of people will suffer and hard-won development gains will be reversed."The agencies said it was vital to scale up their response to prevent hunger-related deaths."I hope we will not get to that point," said Lewis Hove, from the Food and Agriculture Organisation. "We are working to make sure that it does not happen."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
