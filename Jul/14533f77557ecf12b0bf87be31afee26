The station commander was among those killed, West Pokot County Commissioner Wilson Wanyanga said.He said the man was suspected of recruiting for Somali armed group al-Shabab.Al-Shabab has launched a series of attacks against Kenya in recent years, including using local recruits. The group says the attacks are aimed at driving Kenyan forces out of Somalia, where they are part of an African force fighting al-Shabab.More than 100 al-Shabab members raided a police station in northeast Kenya last week, wounding one officer and making off with arms and ammunition. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
