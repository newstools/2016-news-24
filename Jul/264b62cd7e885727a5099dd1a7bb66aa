IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson, Paul Herbst, said while the cause of the accident remained unclear, evidence from the scene suggested the car had been travelling north. "The driver lost control and the vehicle rolled multiple times across the centre median and came to a stop on the south bound lane. One person was killed and two others were injured," he said. All three had been flung from the wreckage of the car as it rolled. "Advanced life support intervention was required and the patient was intubated and placed on a ventilator at the scene. The second passenger sustained moderate injuries," &nbsp;Herbst added. He said the road had since been reopened. &nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
