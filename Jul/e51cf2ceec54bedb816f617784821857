According to NewsDay, Douglas Mahiya handed himself over to the police after several armed men had surrounded his home, while Mugabe met with the country&rsquo;s former freedom fighters in the capital of Harare.&nbsp;An unnamed family member claimed that Mahiya&rsquo;s wife and three children, including a four-month-old baby, were locked inside their house by seven unidentified men who only left them after learning that&nbsp;he had handed himself to the police. Police spokesperson Senior Assistant Commissioner Charity Charamba said that Mahiya was being questioned at the Harare police station. "His lawyer brought him to the police and we are questioning him," Charamba was quoted as saying. This comes a week after the former freedom fighters slammed the veteran leader.
