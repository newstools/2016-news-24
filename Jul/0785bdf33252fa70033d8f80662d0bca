The dagga came from Swaziland. "It is true that I was caught with dagga and I admit I broke the law, and I know that it is illegal to sell dagga. I did it out of desperation because I'm unemployed," she told the court. Mpofu&rsquo;s tomato business failed, so she started selling dagga to cover her living costs. The mother of two apologised and asked the court to have mercy on her."My suffering left me with no choice but to break the law and get dagga to sell, and get money to pay rent and take care of my children. My vegetables business was not doing well at all," she said. She was sentenced to three months&rsquo; jail with the option of a R1 000 fine. She was released after paying the fine.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
