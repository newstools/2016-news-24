About 300 000 child marriages were dissolved last year," Kaliati said.Kaliati also attributed the achievement to the enactment of the Marriage, Divorce and Family Relations Act which has pushed the marriage age from 16 to 18.Despite the Marriage, Divorce and Family Relations Act pegging the marriage age at 18, conflicting legislation made the minimum age of marriage ambiguous in Malawi.The provisions of&nbsp;the act&nbsp;could not overwrite the Constitution, which stipulated that girls and boys aged 15 to 18 could marry with parental consent.Source of income&nbsp;The contradiction&nbsp;arises as the Malawi constitution does not specifically prohibit the marriage of children under 15, but merely directed the government to "discourage" them.Child marriages were regarded as a source of income, as the girls&rsquo; families got payment of dowry (lobola).Government statistics showed that between 2010 and 2013, at least 28 000 girls in primary schools and 4 053 in secondary schools dropped out due to marriage. During the same period, another 14 051 primary school girls and 5 597 secondary school girls dropped out because they were pregnant.Human Rights Watch (HRW) has repeatedly&nbsp;urged Malawi to increase efforts to end widespread child and forced marriage, or risk worsening poverty, illiteracy and preventable maternal deaths.HRW&rsquo;s 69-page report titled, I&rsquo;ve Never Experienced Happiness: Child Marriage in Malawi, observed that child marriage prevented girls and women from participating in all spheres of life.&nbsp;"The practice violates the rights to health, to education, to be free from physical, mental, and sexual violence, and to marry only when able and willing to give free and full consent," read the report. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
