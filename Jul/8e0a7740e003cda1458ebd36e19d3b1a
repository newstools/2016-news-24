Vusi.MthalaneFISHERMEN who were hoping to fill their nets at the start of the sardine run could be disappointed.According to the KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board, only a few very small pockets of sardines were reported by dive operators just north of Coffee Bay on recently. They said the sardines were eaten by Cape gannets, dolphins and copper sharks within the hour that they were spotted.
