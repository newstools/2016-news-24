We do not despair".The kidnapping of the Australian couple was claimed by the Islamist group Ansar Dine, a Malian mainly Tuareg group.Originally from Perth, Kenneth Elliott has lived in Burkina Faso since 1972.After he and his wife were kidnapped, resident of Djibo, the town where they worked, called for their release.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
