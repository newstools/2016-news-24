"We don't have anything here, just a bit of work in the fields during harvest time."Aid promisedFood distribution to the refugees was stopped in November and only 3% of the aid promised by donors to the UNHCR has been allocated since the start of the year."The donors would rather invest in the country, given that the situation in Ivory Coast is stabilising," said the UNHCR spokesperson in Ghana, Nii Ako Sowa.With growth at 8% last year, Ivory Coast, Ghana's neighbour to the west, is no longer a priority for aid. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
