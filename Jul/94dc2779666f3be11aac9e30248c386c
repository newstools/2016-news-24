"Uganda has met its goal in the fighting against LRA," Ugandan army spokesperson Paddy Ankunda told AFP last month. "The LRA has been degraded, they no longer have means to make war."About 2 000 Ugandan soldiers, backed by US troops, are currently deployed in the CAR under the aegis of the African Union.About 10 000 foreign troops are also serving in the country as part of a United Nations mission, Minusca.The LRA acquired a fearsome reputation because of its brutal activities in northern Uganda, South Sudan, the DRC and the CAR, where a coup in 2013 was followed by ethnic and religious clashes that claimed thousands of lives and displaced about a quarter of the population.Though weakened by the capture or defection of several commanders, the LRA gained a foothold in the CAR because of a lack of government authority and military strength in the east, where Minusca forces are present only in the main towns.According to the United Nations, the LRA has killed more than 100 000 people and kidnapped more than 60 000 children, initially inside Uganda before it was routed by the army of President Yoweri Museveni, then in neighbouring countries.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
