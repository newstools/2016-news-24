The County Governor, Godana Doyo reportedly fired Medical Superintendent Abdikadir Mohammud after he exposed the sorry state of Isiolo Level Four Hospital. The hospital had allegedly been using expired blood due to shortages, a factor that had contributed to increased maternal deaths in the facility. A report by Standard indicated that early this year, Abdikadir was demoted for revealing that patients at the facility were going without food. He was reinstated by members of the Isiolo County Assembly. However, when Doyo found him taking the County Commissioner round the hospital during an inspection on Friday, he accused him of giving wrong information to the media and sacked him. Sources claimed that Doyo also slapped Abdikadir in front of other workers and County officials. This prompted area residents to storm the facility in protest against the governor, with Daily Nation reporting that the angry residents threw stones at the his delegation and injured some County officials. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
