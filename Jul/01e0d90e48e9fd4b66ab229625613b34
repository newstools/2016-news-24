He was accused of smuggling a cellphone into Krejcir&rsquo;s cell.They both appeared in the Kempton Park Magistrate&rsquo;s Court on Monday on charges of defeating the administration of justice, conspiring to allow a prisoner to escape from custody, and corruption.They will be joining Krejcir and another two prison officials who have been charged with aiding and abetting a prisoner to escape, as well as corruption.It was previously reported that Christopher&rsquo;s father was ex-MK leader Russell Christopher, who was also a former security head at Parliament.
