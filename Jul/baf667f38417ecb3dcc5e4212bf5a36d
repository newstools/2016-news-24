Send us your eyewitness accounts and photos.Luc Quevauvilliers, who helps the Facebook group #CleanBlueLagoon, told News24 that a clean-up operation was planned for Saturday.&ldquo;Basically there may have been more rain this week than the last time we did this and looking at the river mouth at Blue Lagoon yesterday [Monday], stuff was just charging through. Once high tide comes up and goes out again everything will be left on the beach,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;There is going to be a huge amount of rubbish that is going to wash up.&rdquo;- Gallery: Weather plays havoc in SAQuevauvilliers said that given the amount of flotsam expected to have washed down from the rivers inland, it was unlikely that the clean-up would be completed in one day alone.&ldquo;Before we had a couple of days over the Easter weekend, but we will be meeting at the beach on Saturday and get as many people down there as possible to try and put a dent in it,&rdquo; he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
