"There may even be some South Sudanese who want to leave.""Juba is totally peaceful and calm now and we do not expect any problems. The problems could be on the road where there are a few thugs. The first responsibility of any UPDF soldier is to protect himself and we are confident in this," Kyanda said.Kyanda said the mission would likely last "two to three days".The Ugandan army joined the conflict in South Sudan soon after it began in December 2013, fighting on the side of President Salva Kiir against a rebel force led by Riek Machar, now the country's vice president.The Ugandan presence helped prevent the capital from falling into rebel hands while its attack helicopters were deployed to bomb rebel soldiers out of regional towns. Ugandan troops only pulled out late last year.Although military officials insist Thursday's incursion is a straightforward evacuation mission, an intelligence officer speaking on condition of anonymity said some Ugandan troops may remain in Juba."Why not? We have the capacity to support the government of South Sudan and we were there before," said the plain-clothed officer accompanying the convoy.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
