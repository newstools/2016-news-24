The violence came amid a surge in protests in recent weeks because of increasing economic hardship and alleged mismanagement by the government of President Robert Mugabe.An Associated Press journalist saw protesters severely beating two police officers with sticks, then taking their uniforms and helmets and wearing them.The protesters blocked roads leading into the centre of Harare, forcing many people to walk up to 10 km to get to work. Rioters threw stones at police and vehicles, and some children on their way to school were caught up in the chaos.Outnumbered police later sought to negotiate with the crowds after failing to disperse thousands of protesters, who were concentrated in Harare's eastern suburbs. Many rioters were young men who can't find regular employment and make a living off drivers by charging a small fee to load passengers into minibuses.The drivers' grievances stem from anger over numerous roadblocks that police sometimes set up in city streets, which drivers allege are to demand bribes. Police recently promised to reduce the number of roadblocks after complaints from parliamentarians, tourism operators and others.Such acts of defiance and clashes with the police are rare in Zimbabwe, although the government deployed the army against the 1998 riots over soaring food prices. Mugabe, 92, has ruled the southern African country since independence from white minority rule in 1980, scoffing at frequent allegations of human rights violations.Near-daily protestsFrustrations over rapidly deteriorating economic conditions in Zimbabwe, compounded by dissatisfaction over alleged government corruption and incompetence, have resulted in near-daily protests in recent weeks.On Friday, protesters burned a warehouse at Beitbridge, a busy border post between Zimbabwe and South Africa, over a Zimbabwean decision to ban a wide range of imports.Seventeen people appeared in court on Sunday over the Beitbridge protests and were charged with public violence.Separately, state hospital doctors and other government workers said they will strike over the government's failure to pay their June salaries on time.Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa has been pleading with Western countries to unlock financing for Zimbabwe in the form of loans that were halted close to two decades ago. The financing dried up due to failure to repay debts, as well as international sanctions imposed because of concerns over democratic rights.Some recent political protests have been notable for their brazenness. Police said they are looking for Lumumba William Matumanje, a former ruling party activist who used an obscenity to denigrate Mugabe while launching his own political party last week. People have often been sent to jail for such conduct in Zimbabwe.Last month, video footage showed an anti-government protester shouting in the lobby of an upscale hotel in Harare and haranguing police until they moved in and dragged him away. The video shows a protest by activists angry at Vice President Phelekezela Mphoko's alleged 18-month stay in a $400-a-night (about R5 800) hotel suite in the capital, Harare.Activist Sten Zvorwadza was charged with threats to commit malicious damage to property and was freed on $200 (about R2 900) bail.The majority of Zimbabwe's citizens survive on just a dollar a day, the official statistics agency says.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
