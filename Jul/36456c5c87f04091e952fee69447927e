These are just political games ahead of the upcoming local government elections,&rdquo; he said.Several senior journalists at the embattled public broadcaster have been suspended after they questioned a decision by the SABC not to show footage of violent protests.They were also charged for questioning why staff were forbidden to report on a protest outside the SABC&rsquo;s Auckland Park offices over a directive by its chief operating officer, Hlaudi Motsoeneng, not to show violent protests.Mzileni said none of the suspended SABC employees were members of the CWU.The union will picket outside the SABC offices in Durban tomorrow to show their support of the SABC.Meanwhile, there was drama at the union&rsquo;s briefing yesterday after the ANC Youth League in the province pulled out of the briefing at the eleventh hour.Provincial Youth League secretary Thanduxolo Sabelo said the mother body had ordered its structures not to comment on the matter.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
