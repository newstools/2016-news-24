He is surrounded by soldiers, but feels he is surrounded by enemies. He must have suspected cameras in his car. How could he run from his car and sit on the roadside to make a call?" Besigye asked.Besigye also criticised Museveni for the road closures that were enforced whenever he was hosting foreign visitors, accusing the him of preventing those visitors from seeing the Ugandan people he led.Besigye, a four-time presidential candidate was incarcerated for 62 days on treason charges after he was arrested in May for releasing a video in which he held a mock swearing-in ceremony to protest what he claimed was a fraudulent election in February, won by Museveni.&nbsp;Museveni: Wait, #Besigyexit?
