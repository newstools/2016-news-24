The party broke ranks and protested in support of suspended journalists and accused the public broadcaster of &ldquo;dictatorial apartheid-style censorship.&rdquo;&ldquo;Our hearts are bleeding because we expect an organisation which is our vanguard as the working class to be at the forefront in defending our decisions as workers, but instead the SACP is going out there and ridiculing and supporting the decisions made by right-wing organisations,&rdquo; CWU provincial secretary Thami Mzileni told reporters in Durban.He said the SA Communist Party&rsquo;s statements about developments at the SABC were disturbing.&nbsp;The SACP was part of a recent meeting of CWU leaders, at which it did not object to the decision to support the SABC. Three days later, the SACP said it would picket outside the SABC, Mzileni said.&ldquo;We call on the communist party to engage us as the union so that we can clarify the matter, because we believe that the decision that they are currently acting on is not informed.&rdquo;In May, SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng said the broadcaster would no longer air footage of the destruction of public property during protests.Mzileni said the CWU was not critical of the ANC&rsquo;s stance on the SABC, because the ruling party had discussed the matter with it.On July 5, ANC communications sub-committee chair Jackson Mthembu said the SABC&rsquo;s decision was arrogant, and in contravention of the Constitution and ANC policy.&ldquo;At least the ANC has taken the liberty to sit down with us. The SACP has not done this.&rdquo;While the CWU supported freedom of speech, the SABC&rsquo;s decision what to air was an editorial matter.Earlier, the union said it would rally behind Motsoeneng because he had improved working conditions at the SABC.The union was expected to picket outside the SABC's offices in Durban on Thursday in support of Motsoeneng.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
