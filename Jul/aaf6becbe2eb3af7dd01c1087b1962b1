On June 25, 2014, explosions ripped through the port area near a major fuel depot.The authorities blamed the blast on a cooking gas cylinder which exploded but eyewitnesses and Western diplomats said it was a car bomb that killed at least four people.Boko Haram's shadowy leader Abubakar Shekau later claimed responsibility.The US Embassy's latest warning did not mention a specific group but urged its citizens to "review your personal security plans, remain aware of your surroundings, including local events, and monitor local news stations for updates".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
