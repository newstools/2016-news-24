We cannot breathe in an anti-black world. We are being killed left, right and centre," he said."We want to make it very, very clear. Every black person that dies in America affects all of us."They held up posters that&nbsp;read "Stop killing blacks", "Black pride", "Black power" and "Bring back my people".'We are prepared to defend ourselves'They demanded that the United States withdraw from South Africa until the killing of black people stopped.Another demand was that the consulate tell the US government to release four people arrested in Detroit for social media comments made over Micah Johnson.Johnson killed five police officers during a #Blacklivesmatter rally in Dallas last week.Consulate public affairs official Kimberly Mcclure accepted the group&rsquo;s memorandum.She said the issue had quite a bit of significance, both personally and professionally."I want to thank you for taking the time to have this conversation with us. We hope that this moment today will be just the first step in our having this conversation here in Cape Town," she said, before returning inside.Skosana said the consulate had eight days to assure them there would be no more unnecessary killings."If that persists, of course it is upon us... we will no longer fall for the dominant narrative of peace and reconciliation," he said."We are prepared to defend ourselves by any means necessary if we must do that." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
