	     Durban - A man is expected to appear before the Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday for an alleged double murder in KwaMashu hostel over the weekend. The man, a victim of a house robbery in KwaMahshu, had allegedly gone looking for the robbers with his friends, Captain Nqobile Gwala said. "While they were looking for these people who robbed him in the house, they went to one of the shacks in KwaMashu hostel where they met a man and woman," Gwala said. He said the suspect and his friends then allegedly shot and killed the two victims in the shack, before fleeing the scene on foot. The 42-year man was arrested over the weekend.  KwaZulu-Natal acting police commissioner Major General Bhekinkosi Langa said the team of detectives would not rest until the other suspects were also arrested.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
