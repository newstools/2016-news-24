We urge the portfolio committee on communications to demonstrate its oversight leadership."Parliament and portfolio committees are allowed to reconvene during recesses under National Assembly rule 223 if a matter is deemed urgent.'People won&rsquo;t trust election outcome'Gabuza said he was concerned about the negative impact that such an "overdrawn crisis" would have on the elections.&nbsp; "People will not trust the outcome of the elections if the dispute regarding fair coverage and censorship by a public broadcaster is not resolved," he said."It is in the interests of the common good, and a matter of urgency, that public confidence in the public broadcaster be restored."Gabuza said he believed that&nbsp;Parliament had the ability to do this.Icasa rulingThe Independent Communications Authority of SA (Icasa)&nbsp;ruled on Monday that the SABC must withdraw its resolution to ban the broadcasting of violent protests, following a public hearing into the broadcaster&rsquo;s decision held in June.SABC chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng on Monday said&nbsp;the broadcaster&nbsp;would take its fight against the ruling to the highest court in the land.Icasa spokesperson Paseka Maleka told News24 on&nbsp;Tuesday that they would not be commenting on the SABC&rsquo;s&nbsp;response&nbsp;until the broadcaster submitted its written reply to the Complaints Compliance Committee.The SABC was given seven days to reply to Icasa&rsquo;s order."Obviously, Icasa will want to know the reasons for non-compliance with the order and possibly decide on a way forward," Maleka said.- Read more: SA is not a dictatorship - A summary of Icasa's ruling24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
