And just like everyone else, you go through the creditors.&nbsp;That has been done,&rdquo; said Mulaudzi. On Sunday, a member of the Democratic Alliance representing the party in the provincial legislature, Kate Lorimer, said Mokotedi still had no security clearance, and should not get it. &ldquo;He has two court judgments against him for outstanding debt,&rdquo; she said in a statement. 'Just politics' Lorimer said the judgments were handed down in December last year. They involved R1m for a bond, R100 480 for a credit card, and an amount of R9 559 owed on an Absa credit card. &ldquo;With these judgments against him, he would never qualify for security clearance as they would, one assumes, make him a high risk for future corrupt or criminal activity,&rdquo; Lorimer said. Mulaudzi said the opposition party was &ldquo;making an issue out of nothing.&nbsp;Just politics&rdquo;. He said getting security clearance took time, and that Moketedi was in the final stages of the process. Part of it involved looking into his finances. The last check was a polygraph test. &ldquo;It does not take overnight. It depends on the availability of the investigators from crime intelligence and state security,&rdquo; Mulaudzi explained, adding that&nbsp; he did not yet have full security clearance and was also in the final stages of the vetting procedure. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
