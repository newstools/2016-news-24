Here, adolescents are taught how to have sex and are forced into sexual intercourse, over three days, after the start of their first period.The ritual is believed to train girls to become good wives and to protect them from disease or misfortune that could befall their families or their village.May Shaba, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Gender and Welfare, has said that those who indulge in the practice cannot be condemned. They would instead be given information in the hope that this would make them change their ways.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
