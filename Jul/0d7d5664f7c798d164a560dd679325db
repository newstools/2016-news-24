She lived in a shack until recently, relocating to live with one of her children and grandchildren in the same area."At my age, I felt it was not safe for me to stay in a shack, hence I decided to go stay with my child and her grandchildren," she said. "Now that I have a decent house that can withstand any weather conditions, I cannot wait to move into my new house."Molefe, currently surviving on a disability grant, was forced to stay in a shack after her mud house was destroyed almost 19 years ago, the department said. "I have waited for this moment all my life. I will now sleep peacefully knowing that I have a decent roof over my head. Nothing beats the feeling of owning [a house], finally,&rdquo; she said.MEC for local government and human settlements in North West, Galaletsang Gaolaolwe, said the department would try to continue with similar projects to help with housing security.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
