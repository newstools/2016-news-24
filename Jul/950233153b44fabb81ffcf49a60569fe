What we expect is an acquittal, not amnesty," he told AFP.The activists were in March handed sentences of between two and eight years in prison but were released in June to serve out the rest of the sentences at home.The activists say they are peaceful campaigners seeking the departure of dos Santos, who has been in power since 1979 and rules the oil-rich country with an iron fist.Correctional Services spokesperson Menezes Cassoma said the law would help to relieve pressure on overcrowded prisons.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
