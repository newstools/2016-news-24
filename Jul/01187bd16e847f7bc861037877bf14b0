Tammy Petersen, News24Cape Town - The wait for a bed at Valkenberg Psychiatric Hospital continues for murder accused Delvigo Ward, who appeared in the Bredasdorp Magistrate&rsquo;s Court on Thursday.The court heard that the 20-year-old was number 87 on the waiting list, Western Cape National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said. The matter was postponed to August 5. He abandoned his bail bid last month. His mental state would be observed to establish if he was fit to stand trial. Ward is accused of the brutal murder of 22-year-old Sulnita Manho. Her body was found at the lime works in the rural Overberg town on Saturday, April 2. She had apparently been at a local pub with friends when a man offered to walk her back to her farm outside Bredasdorp. She was found with a rope around her neck, and had been hit on the head with a brick. She had reportedly been raped and a bottle was inserted into her vagina. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
