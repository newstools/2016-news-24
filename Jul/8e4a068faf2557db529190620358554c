Yet fighting continues.Babikr Yawa, a mother of three, fled fighting last month in the Kajo-Keji district, close to the border with Uganda."We are suffering here. There is no food, no good shelter," Yawa said. "What we want is that President Salva Kiir and Riek Machar should end the conflict."'Epic corruption'In June, fighting in the town of Wau &ndash; now the country's second city after Malakal, Bor and Bentiu were razed during the war &ndash; forced some 88 000 people to flee their homes, with almost 20 000 seeking shelter beside a UN base.The peace deal is simply being ignored, the ICG said. "Formerly warring parties are now flouting it and increasingly preparing for widespread conflict," said the ICG."Unless something is done, it is a matter of only a little time before there is a return to war, and the agreement collapses."The mood on the streets is very far from the celebrations of 2011. Earlier this year UN chief Ban Ki-moon recalled the sense of euphoria, "the pride, the spirit, the hope", when he witnessed the raising of the new country's flag at independence.Speaking after his last visit in February, Ban spoke instead of how "that hope has been betrayed... by those who put power and profit over people" in a speech citing "massive human rights violations and epic corruption".'How can we survive?'The economic collapse is driving unrest and threatening peace, aid workers say."A peaceful South Sudan cannot be built without solid foundations," said Oxfam's country chief Zlatko Gegic. "South Sudan's economy is in crisis. Without economic reform, its people will continue to suffer and the fragile peace process will be jeopardised."A kilogram of sugar that used to cost eight South Sudanese pounds (about R19.36) now costs 30 (about R72.60), while a 50kg bag of white flour that once sold for 180 (about R435.60), now costs 1 200 (about R2 904)."We are just living in problems and nothing is good," said Etisam Ahmed, sitting in a market on the dusty streets of Juba. "We are just here by God's grace. If you go to the market today and buy something, tomorrow you will find the price has increased. So how can we survive?"More than 160 000 civilians are living in UN-guarded camps across the country &ndash; down from a peak of more than 200 000 at the height of the war &ndash; a clear indicator that many feel it is still too dangerous to go home.South Sudanese say that there is no doubt independence was the right choice, but many are deeply saddened by the turn their nation has taken and are yet to see the benefits of peace."I think it will be hard to find a South Sudanese person who regrets independence, despite all that has happened," Deng said."That's not to say that independence was the silver bullet that people made it out to be at the time. It is clear now that even without the role of Khartoum there, in terms of destabilising South Sudan, we had our own share of issues that needed to be addressed."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
