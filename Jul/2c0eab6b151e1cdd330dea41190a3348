Johannesburg – An eNCA journalist was attacked during a service delivery protest in Meyerton on Friday, the broadcaster reported. The crowd turned on Lenyaro Sello, hit her on her back and threw a stone at her. Online editor Lynne O'Connor said on the eNCA website that she was a little bruised, but fine. Police spokesperson Captain Fikile Funda said officers had been on the scene on the R59 from early Friday morning to ensure protesters did not disrupt traffic. "Some people wanted to protest, but retreated back to their settlements and traffic is flowing normally," Funda told News24 around lunchtime. Residents from the Sicelo informal settlement in Meyerton on Thursday blocked roads, calling for better service delivery in the town, which is in the DA-run Midvaal municipality. Protesters demanded to speak to Midvaal Mayor Bongani Baloyi. On Thursday, several cars were damaged as protesters threw rocks at them. Funda said police would remain on the scene.     24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
