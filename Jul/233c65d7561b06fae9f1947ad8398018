outside the United Nations Mine Action Service offices in Mogadishu, killing 10
people, including seven UN guards, a Somali police official said on Tuesday. Unlike previous attacks blamed on the al-Qaeda-linked militant
group al-Shabaab, gunmen did not accompany the suicide bomber, Captain Mohamed
Hussein said. He said that the suicide car bomber tried to speed through the
barrier at the UN office but guards shot at the car. Hussein said a second suicide blast targeted a checkpoint manned
by Somali security forces near the African Union base in Mogadishu. Casualties
there remain unclear. Al-Shabaab has claimed responsibility for the blasts, according to
the group's Andalus radio station. Al-Shabaab is waging an insurgency against
Somalia's weak UN-backed government. Al-Shabaab wants to establish an Islamic
emirate in the country based on a strict form of Islam. Eight soldiers were killed when an al-Shabaab suicide car bomber
targeted a Somalia military training camp and attackers then entered the base
on foot earlier this month. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
