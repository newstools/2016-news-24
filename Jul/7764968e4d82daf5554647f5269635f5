"We also found pornography photos of children aged 8 and 16 and CD DVD's. The photos are taken by the accused himself because we can see his fingers on women's tissues."&nbsp;Case not strong - lawyer She said Molise was not present when the photos were taken.&nbsp;Steyn said they also found boxes of medication brought from Denmark in the freezer. However, his lawyer Deon Pool said the word "circumcision" comes up repeatedly in Frederiksen's diary .&nbsp; "He never said mutilation, he said circumcision, and his wife was available during the circumcisions, which is common practice in Lesotho." Earlier, Pool said the State's case against Frederiksen was not as strong as it had been presented to be. Frederiksen had initially been facing 15 charges, however the charges have now increased to 59.&nbsp; Murdered wife would have been State witnessThey include assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, possessing unregistered medicine, possessing unlicenced firearms, distributing and possessing child pornography, conspiracy to commit&nbsp;murder, and bigamy.Frederiksen, 63, was arrested on September 17, 2015, after 21 clitorises were found in the freezer of his Langenhoven Park, Bloemfontein, home.He is also being investigated for the murder of his wife, 28-year-old Molise.
