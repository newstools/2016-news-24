The deputy minister demanded that he be allowed to talk, to which a sex worker in the crowd replied: &ldquo;If you are allowed to talk, we should be allowed to work&rdquo;.Jeffery said it was up to the government to take up the decriminalisation of sex workers and that although buying and selling sex was illegal in SA, the prosecution of sex workers was not a priority. He said only 241 cases had been opened against sex workers in the last three years.Shackleton said that two sex workers had not been allowed into the conference due to criminal records.&ldquo;This is supposed to be an international conference that involves discussions surrounding the rights of sex workers, yet they were not allowed access.&ldquo;Sex workers should be at the front of the queue for such gatherings, but they are not,&rdquo; she said.Shackleton said one of the sex workers was eventually allowed in, but the other was not.A Durban sex worker, who would not be named, said they had been fighting for decriminalisation for many years.&ldquo;Most of us sex workers know our status, but we fear for our safety. We do not have access to basic health services because our work is illegal,&rdquo; she said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
