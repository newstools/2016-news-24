Wim Pretorius, News24Johannesburg &ndash; Two drug busts,&nbsp;worth about R1m each, were made at OR Tambo International Airport on Wednesday.In the first incident, it was discovered that a parcel of wedding cards contained more than messages of congratulations. According to the South African Revenue Service (Sars), customs officials discovered wedding cards en-route to Australia concealing 3.5kg of heroin estimated at a value of R1m."The parcel containing the cards was profiled by the dog detector unit during a routine inspection at an international courier company at the OR Tambo International Airport," Sars spokesperson Sandile Memela said in a statement.The weight of the cards proved to be the plan's downfall, as it was not consistent with regular cards. Upon inspection, it was discovered that the cards had hidden compartments filled with the drugs.Another passenger, a South African woman, who was on an inbound flight from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, was also caught in possession of 4.2kg of cocaine, estimated&nbsp;to be worth&nbsp;R1.2m."The bust took place after an examination of the passenger's backpack revealed a false compartment containing a white powder testing positive for cocaine," Memela said.The South African Police Service would continue with further investigations into the matters. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
