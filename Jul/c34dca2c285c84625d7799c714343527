We need clean governance with clearly defined terms of offices and presidential terms for leaders. The voice of the people must rule," he said.Phosa was presented with a second award on the same evening - a Lifetime Achievement Award for his role in the apartheid struggle, in helping to establish democracy, and for his selflessness.He said the fixation with personal power was a major concern of his."The late President Nelson Mandela walked away from power and became even more powerful because of it. Those who cling to power will always lose it, whether they stay in office or not," he said.Phosa, now a businessman, was one of a few ANC leaders who broke ranks with the organisation by calling for President Jacob Zuma to step down.This followed the Constitutional Court&rsquo;s ruling on March 31 that he had violated the Constitution when he ignored Public Protector Thuli Madonsela&rsquo;s remedial action about the so-called security upgrades to his Nkandla homestead.Terry Booysen, chief executive officer of the Corporate Governance Framework, said Phosa&rsquo;s unapologetic stance against unethical, corrupt leadership was an inspiration to all. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
