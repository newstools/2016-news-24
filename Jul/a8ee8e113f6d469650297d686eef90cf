It was even more traumatising for the Forensic Pathology Service colleagues who had to retrieve so many bodies from the scene and transport them to our State Mortuary in Harding.&rdquo;Dhlomo said it was &ldquo;devastating&rdquo; that just one accident could claim so many lives. In a statement, Dhlomo said a bakkie overturned at the KwaMbotho area in Harding at the Lower South Coast on Sunday evening, leaving 11 people dead. Dhlomo said he has since requested the Ugu District health management provide psychological counselling &ldquo;for all those who were involved&rdquo;.Dhlomo&rsquo;s spokesperson Desmond Motha told News24 the majority of victims were women. &ldquo;At this stage we do not have further information. Once we know more we will be in a better position to provide details.&rdquo;&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
