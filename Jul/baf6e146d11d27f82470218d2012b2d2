Jenna Etheridge, News24 Cape Town – Two brothers attached to the police’s tactical response team in Kimberley have been arrested with three others for an armed robbery attack in May, Northern Cape Hawks said on Tuesday. An investigation into the attack on the G4S Cash Solutions Kimberley base led officers to a premises belonging to Sergeant Samuel Jantjies, 45, and Densel Deon Jantjies, 35, said Captain Philani Nkwalase. On the evening of May 6, three armed men gained access to the base and tied up a security guard. They took off with a service firearm and an undisclosed amount of cash. When another security guard returned from a shop, he found his unharmed co-worker tied up, and reported the matter. Nkwalase said money was recovered from different premises linked to the brothers. More than R1.4m was recovered. Also arrested last week were Constable Hendrik Daniels, 35, Jennifer Claasen, 46, and Jean Pierre Wolfaard, 26. Daniels appeared in the Kimberley Magistrate’s Court on Monday. The others appeared last Friday. They were all expected to apply for bail on Thursday.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
