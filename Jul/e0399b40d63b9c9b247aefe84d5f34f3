Harare - Tens of thousands of supporters of Zimbabwe's ruling party are marching in the capital, Harare, in response to a series of recent protests against the government of 92-year-old President Robert Mugabe.The supporters sang and chanted slogans on Wednesday in support of Mugabe, who has been in power for 36 years.Discontent has been growing over Zimbabwe's deteriorating economy and alleged corruption and human rights abuses.A nationwide job boycott called via social media by a church pastor, Evan Mawarire, earlier this month received a huge response not seen in close to a decade.Mugabe on Tuesday criticised Mawarire for the first time publicly by name, urging him and his supporters to leave Zimbabwe if they are unhappy with conditions at home.#zimbabwe zanu pf supporters march in #harare on weds. say this is their counter to the recent anti-gvt protests pic.twitter.com/ZW1zA6dttSZanu PF supporters marching in Harare today. pic.twitter.com/Mj29gVhJA324.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
