Commission elections postponed till next summit," Dlamini-Zuma's spokesperson, Jacob Enoh Eben, said on Twitter, referencing the smoke signal that precedes the naming of a new pope.None of the three candidates was able to muster the two-thirds majority required to win in the secret ballot.Ahead of the vote many states had expressed dismay at the "lack of stature" among the little known candidates from Botswana, Equatorial-Guinea and Uganda and, in the end, 28 of the 54 member states abstained from the final round of voting thus forcing a postponement of the election and an extension of Dlamini-Zuma's term.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
