Freedom of expression was not freedom to insult, Mavundla said.Mabulu&rsquo;s latest painting, which was on display at Constitution Hill in Johannesburg, depicts President Jacob Zuma licking the anus of one of the Gupta brothers, Atul, in the cockpit of a plane.&ldquo;The artist&rsquo;s rabid hatred of our commander in chief has to be condemned by all as it is disrespectful, insulting and flies in the face of the values of ubuntu.&rdquo;The painting was one of four by the artist and formed part of a group exhibition centred on the theme of post-apartheid South Africa. Mabulu&rsquo;s earlier paintings of Zuma with his genitalia exposed indicated Mabulu was a &ldquo;sadistic person&rdquo;, Mavundla said.He said Mabulu should not exhibit his art in public spaces.&ldquo;The president has got kids. Can you imagine what happens when they see these paintings?&rdquo;MKMVA members would whisper into Mabulu&rsquo;s ear that he was treading on thin ice.The Mail &amp; Guardian quoted Mabulu as saying that he did not have an obsession with Zuma, but with &ldquo;the hierarchical system where if you climb up, you can be looked at as a demigod, and we, the people on the ground, are looked at as nothing.&rdquo; The depiction of genitalia in his work was an act of unmasking. &ldquo;When I am stripping them out of their underwear, I am exposing the naked truth that is hidden,&rdquo; he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
