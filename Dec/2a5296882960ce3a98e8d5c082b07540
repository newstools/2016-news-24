The official says that Osama Morsi was wanted by authorities, without providing further details. The state-run news website Al-Ahram reported the arrest, saying Osama is accused of inciting violence. The official says Osama, one of Morsi's five children, was led away from his house in the Nile Delta on Thursday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to brief the press. Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected president, was overthrown by the military in 2013. He faces a raft of charges in at least four separate cases and has received death sentences from lower courts. He has not received family visits or had any access to lawyers for three years. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
