These included Castro&rsquo;s approach to education, health care, and land.&ldquo;Like Fidel, we are not fighting. This is a sensible argument. No guns, not fighting, just asking you to return land to its rightful owners.&rdquo;He criticized the ANC for abandoning Castro&rsquo;s ideals.&ldquo;Why would the ANC stand up and celebrate Fidel? They sold out what he stood for.&rdquo;Castro had warned leaders like former president Nelson Mandela and the ANC that they would struggle with the &ldquo;boere&rdquo; (Afrikaners) over the Freedom Charter.&ldquo;Zuma is the Batista of our time,&rdquo; said Malema. He was referring to US-backed Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista, who Castro overthrew in 1959.Zuma, like Batista, introduced laws that suppressed socialism and dissent.&ldquo;He (Castro) said we can&rsquo;t sit back and allow a man who suppresses us. Every time we speak, we get arrested, get prosecuted for political speech,&rdquo; Malema said.Continuing his comparison between Batista and the current ANC-led government, Malema said during Batista&rsquo;s era, gangsters were found in cabinet.&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t behave like it&rsquo;s not possible. We have that here,&rdquo; he told the crowd, which gasped and laughed at the comment.He referred to State Security Minister David Mahlobo&rsquo;s relationship with a self-confessed rhino horn trafficker and Mbombela massage parlour owner.Malema said the government was made of &ldquo;criminals who capture state power to benefit themselves and their friends&rdquo;.Jubilant supporters cheered and clapped while he spoke. People in the crowd told News24 earlier that this was how a legend should be honoured, and &ldquo;not that thing of the ANC&rdquo;. The ANC held two memorial services in honour of Castro on Wednesday night.EFF is Fidel CastroMalema said the EFF was the &ldquo;Fidel Castro of the 21st&nbsp;century&rdquo;.He said Castro had no choice but to fight Batista&rsquo;s regime because they were not being heard.&ldquo;They took over Cuba through the barrel of a gun. Fidel was not violent. They made him violent.&rdquo;He said white people should stop being cry-babies because no one was going to kill them.&ldquo;This killing mentality is in your head,&rdquo; he said.He reiterated his support for peace and justice, but said peace could not come before justice.Although Castro was not perfect and had his flaws, the EFF admired his socialist ideals.&ldquo;The only way you can honour Fidel is by taking back our land,&rdquo; he concluded.Malema said an EFF delegation would travel to Cuba to mourn and celebrate Castro&rsquo;s life. He died on Friday, aged 90.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
