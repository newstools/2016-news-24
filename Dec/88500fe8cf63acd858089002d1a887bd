A statement on Wednesday says the two countries' sovereign wealth funds will jointly develop the pipeline to run about 4 000km along the West African coast from Nigeria to Morocco on a route yet to be decided. Coastal countries include Benin, Togo, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Gambia, Senegal and Mauritania. The coastline then runs through the disputed territory of Western Sahara before reaching Morocco. The agreement was signed during a visit to Nigeria this week by King Mohammed VI of Morocco, who has been touring several African countries. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
