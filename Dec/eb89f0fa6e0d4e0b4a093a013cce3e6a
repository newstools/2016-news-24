Seventeen patients had been brought back to the hospital by Monday evening, he said, "and I am very optimistic they'll be gotten before long, all of them will be back."Meanwhile, police fired tear gas in the capital, Nairobi, to disperse dozens of doctors protesting that they have not received salary increases promised three years ago.Around 5 000 doctors from public hospitals nationwide did not report to work, said Ouma Olunga, secretary-general of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union.Medical workers are demanding better pay and working conditions.
