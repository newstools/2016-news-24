It also recognised the right of former commanders of the ANC liberation army to meet.The latter are expected to hold their own conference on Saturday.Nzimande said although a delegation from the communist party would not be attending the council, one of his deputies Solly Mapaila would be attending the event but in his capacity as a former MK member. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
