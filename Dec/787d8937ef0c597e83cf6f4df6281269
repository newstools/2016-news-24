They found that the South Sudan government is intentionally moving civilians from the Dinka ethnic group out of Yei, a town that has seen significant fighting near the border of Uganda and the Congo, Ken Scott, a member of the UN team, told The Associated Press on Friday in Nairobi. He warned that South Sudan's violence could soon spill over into Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia.The core definition of ethnic cleansing is displacement along ethnic lines, said Scott."It can take many forms, obviously killing people is the most extreme, raping very close to that, destruction of property, destruction of schools," he saidThe claims of ethnic cleansing come as the UN Security Council debates placing an arms embargo and targeted sanctions on South Sudan. Those sanctions are supported by the United States.The international community should place sanctions, an arms embargo, and deploy a 4 000 strong force of additional peacekeepers to "avert catastrophe", said investigator Sooka, speaking in the capital of Juba, at a press conference earlier this week.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
