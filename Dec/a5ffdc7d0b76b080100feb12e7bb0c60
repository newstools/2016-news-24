Her body of work includes documentaries for CBC, BBC and the SABC; productions titled Mandela the Man and Walter Sisulu, Father of the Nation. She &nbsp;co-produced and directed a one-hour documentary, Sol Plaatje: A Man for our Time with her daughter Jane.She was part of the historic anti-pass law march to the Union Buildings on August 9, 60 years ago, and her and fellow journalist the late Ruth First used their craft to narrate the country's turbulent history."[Comrade] Beata was a galant fighter for the rights of women who was way ahead of her time," said Dlamini. "Her story is a reflection that women have always played a significant role in the struggle against apartheid. When we speak of the Freedom Charter how many times do we hear that it was hand-written by a woman?"This was a reference to Lipman helping as a scribe when the charter was being discussed and agreed upon.Dlamini said this year the league had decided to tell the stories of the role that women played in changing the face of South African politics. "Women like Cde Beata continue to show us that women have always been capable and are still capable to play a meaningful role in changing the lives of the people." She extended the league's condolences to Lipman's daughter Jane and son Peter, and the family.Lipman's architect and activist husband Alan died in 2013. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
