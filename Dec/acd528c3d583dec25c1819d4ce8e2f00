Nicole.JohnTHE University of KwaZulu-Natal is acutely aware of the financial constraints experienced by many of our students and their families. However, the long-term financial sustainability and survival of the University are also key considerations to ensure that the UKZN can continue to serve its stakeholders appropriately into the future. Taking these issues into account, the Council of the University has approved an eight percent tuition and an eight percent residence accommodation fee increase for the 2017 academic year. The increase will be covered by NSFAS and state funding (DHET) for all students that qualify for NSFAS funding as well as those that can demonstrate a household income below R600 000 per annum. Consequently, both NSFAS and missing middle , which is below R600 000 income, will not experience any fee increases for 2017. At UKZN this means that up to 70% of students will not be required to pay increased fees. Students with a household income above R600 000 will be expected to pay the eight percent increase as determined by council. The decision to increase fees was not an easy one to make and was guided by the announcement made by Minister Blade Nzimande earlier this year and the annual surge in operational costs as well as the rand-dollar exchange rate. - Supplied24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
