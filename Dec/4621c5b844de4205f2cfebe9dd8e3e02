Multimedia &nbsp; &nbsp; User Galleries &nbsp; &nbsp; News in Pictures Send us your pictures &nbsp; &nbsp; Send us your stories IT is very hard to wake up in the morning, have nothing to do all day - all you can do is wait for the dark so you can go back to bed again. Imagine having to spend each and every day sitting in a wheelchair with no activities or stimulus. Sadly this is the lifestyle of many of the disabled people, living in the rural areas.Last month the SA National Taxi Association (Santaco) and Zimbambeleni Community Development Organisation from Muden visited Gujini, a rural underdeveloped community about 10kms from Muden. The village is in the Mhlangane area where there is a clinic and a school.They went to visit 42-year-old Bhekisile Mkhize who was born without arms and legs and lives in a house that is not at all geared to her needs. She has a wheelchair, but is in need of an electronic wheelchair for basic daily living requirements. In a visit to her home Santaco and Zimbambeleni personnel expressed their shock and dismay at her circumstances. Notwithstanding the fact that Bhekisile does not have hands and legs, she does beadwork such as traditional necklace pieces, which brings in a small income. She lives a difficult life, and is in real need of assistance, more specifically an electronic wheelchair that she can operate herself without assistance. The two groups said after their visit they met many people with disabilities who ended up losing hope in terms of improving their lives for the better, because of the shortage of facilities such as schools for disabled people, and user friendly facilities in their homes. Santaco and Zimbambeleni personnel later in the month took along the relevant state authorities. In that community alone there are 18-plus disabled people in need of assistance and a skills centre which would enable them to be taught various skills so they would something to occupy their time and be able to earn money.For more information, contact Ayanda Buthelezi on 082 088 1088._____&lt;https://www.avast.com/antivirus&gt;This email has been checked for viruses by Avast antivirus software. www.avast.com &lt;https://www.avast.com/antivirus&gt;_____&lt;https://www.avast.com/antivirus&gt;This email has been checked for viruses by Avast antivirus software. www.avast.com &lt;https://www.avast.com/antivirus&gt;--- This email has been checked for viruses by Avast antivirus software. https://www.avast.com/antivirus24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
