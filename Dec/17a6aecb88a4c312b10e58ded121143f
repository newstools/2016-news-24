Zuma had complained that he had not had a chance to respond to allegations.After Zuma withdrew his application and the report was released, an audio clip of his interview with Madonsela surfaced and Mkhwebane has laid a complaint with police to find out how it was leaked. She has been criticised for that move.But on Thursday, the focus was not on politicians, but on helping to find ways of keeping women and children safe from violence.Deputy Public Protector Kevin Malunga used commonplace examples of violence to help those attending the event to understand that it was not just physical violence that they should be concerned about.He touched on examples, including verbal abuse and harassment.Thabisa Ngada, the Western Cape manager for the Commission for Gender Equality, said: "Imagine if there were 16 days where there was no violence against women."She said it was time to stop repeating slogans, and to take action in the form of volunteering to help women who need support, especially women who can't get help for themselves.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
