He had apparently stood in a hole under the water and didn't surface again.&ldquo;We&rsquo;d prayed after arriving at Paradise Beach. Then Jack and his buddies took off to play in the water,&rdquo; said Booyse. &nbsp;&ldquo;A caretaker had come to warn us about the holes, but by that time the boys had gone.&ldquo;Shortly after that, I saw one of our congregants rush in the direction of the water. We all followed. When I got there, they told me that my son had drowned. I collapsed. Everything happened so fast.&rdquo;Booyse says her husband, Jakob, wasn&rsquo;t there. He&rsquo;d gone to the shop to buy bread. When he got back, and realised what had happened, he took off his shirt and dived in to search for his son.&nbsp;&ldquo;The life guards and emergency services came, as did a helicopter. After about an hour, one of the life guards came to me and said they normally helped a drowning victim within 15 minutes. He prepared me. I knew Jack was dead.&nbsp;&ldquo;I prayed that his body would be found. Too many mothers have not had the privilege to hold their children&rsquo;s bodies for the last time. I, at least, could," said Booyse.&nbsp;The NSRI&rsquo;s Craig Lambinon said life guards had found Jack&rsquo;s body.&nbsp;&ldquo;You know, everyone talks of his ready smile and good manners. He had a bright future. At 16 he was a man already. I will miss him, but God knows best, &ldquo; said Booyse.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
