Let's close ranks and defend the leadership," he said, adding that leaders should "take responsibility to lead us properly".Dlamini was addressing delegates at the third Young Communist League (YCL) national conference currently underway in Soweto.He gave feedback on discussions from a Cosatu central executive committee (CEC) and an alliance council which took place recently, telling those gathered at the University of Johannesburg that the CEC spent two days dealing with organisational matters but dedicated several hours to discussions on the current state of politics in the country."The ANC at the political level would have been viewed by the CEC as if it was an organisation that was comfortable to be [seen] as if it is at war with itself," he said.He called for leaders to stop fighting each other in public."Why on earth would we enjoy seeing our leaders fighting each other in public?" he asked.Setting the agendaHe also hit out at the ruling party for failing to hear out its alliance partners, Cosatu and the South African Communist Party, when they raised matters that concern workers."You come to an alliance meeting understanding your mandate. [You] say 'comrades, lets prioritise, in the interests of the working class, workers and the poor, issues that are to address inequalities'.""'Let's put the minimum wage on the agenda'," he continued.However, Dlamini said, the response from those in the ruling party was not favourable."Some will say 'no no&hellip; don't use the alliance summit as a bargaining council'," Dlamini told the YCL delegates.He highlighted the federation's expectation of the ANC, stating that the party is meant to have a bias towards the working class, workers and the poor.Cosatu treated like 'a hunting dog'He wondered what had changed to make possible such a negative response to putting the issues that concern those they represent up for discussion."Weren't we together in 2014 and 2016 to make sure the ANC wins the elections? Why are we now treated like a hunting dog?" he asked.He claimed workers were being used to catch prey but were only fed left over bones once the owner and his family had been fed.He further added that Cosatu was being treated like the stepchild of the alliance and accused the ruling party of serving the needs of monopoly capital instead of those of its alliance partners."We are now convinced comrade Cyril Ramaphosa is the one," the Cosatu president said.He said when the ANC succession debate officially kicks of Cosatu and its unions will be lobbying for Ramaphosa to take over from President Jacob Zuma as president of the ANC at the end of 2017. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
