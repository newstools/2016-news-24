Police offers at the station told the Outa team that they had numerous criminal cases opened against the SABC and that all the cases were forwarded to the national office to investigate.Outa included three main allegations against the SABC in its affidavit: alleged fraud and misrepresentation by Motsoeneng and the board related to Motsoeneng&rsquo;s non-existent matric certificate, the agreement Motsoeneng signed on behalf of the SABC with MultiChoice, and procurement irregularities related to the upgrade of various studios.Outa laid out how Motsoeneng applied for a trainee journalist position at the SABC in 1995, falsely claiming he had a matric, then his subsequent rise in the organisation without ever supplying the certificate.&ldquo;A matric qualification was, and still is a standard requirement for employment at the SABC,&rdquo; Outa said in its affidavit.Around April 2012, SABC board chairperson Ben Ngubane told Public Protector Thuli Madonsela that the SABC had perused Motsoeneng&rsquo;s file and could find no evidence that he misrepresented his qualifications. This was despite the findings of a 2003 group internal audit report indicating that the content of Motsoeneng&rsquo;s application for employment was false.&ldquo;The SABC board deliberately turned a blind eye to the wrongfulness of Mr Motsoeneng&rsquo;s acts, furthering the misrepresentations and its effects,&rdquo; Outa said.&ldquo;The SABC management continued to ignore Mr Motsoeneng&rsquo;s representation, whilst affording him promotions, salary increases and new appointments within the SABC,&rdquo; Outa&rsquo;s legal counsel Lerissa Govender said.The second allegation related to the agreement with entertainment and internet company MultiChoice. Motsoeneng personally benefitted from the proceeds of the agreement through a success fee of R11.5million.&ldquo;As a result of the conclusion of the agreement, the SABC suffered monetary loss as well as a loss of a series of intellectual properties to a competitor,&rdquo; the affidavit read.The third allegation related to procurement irregularities in the upgrading of various studios. A bid adjudication committee decision to procure broadcasting equipment for R40.9m was cancelled. Instead, approval was sought for a R39.4m upgrade to a multi-purpose studio. This was a deviation from normal procurement processes.&ldquo;We found a number of anomalies which points to unnecessary expenditure, gross over-payment and potential fraudulent enrichment of external suppliers,&rdquo; Outa said.The organisation said it had full confidence that police would give the case attention.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
