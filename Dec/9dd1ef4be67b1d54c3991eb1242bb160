The problem is that my vehicle which had number plates almost similar to the one on the ticket was scrapped 10 years ago, he said. Furthermore the vehicle mentioned in the fine is a Toyota Cressida but the vehicle in the picture is a Nissan bakkie. I don t know how the traffic department could have made this error and not checked before sending out the mail, he said.Van der Westhuizen said the registration on his scrapped vehicle is only one digit off from the registration number on the bakkie. Perhaps the wrong registration number was punched into the computer but a simple check could have saved me a lot of trouble, he said.Van der Westhuizen said he then had to visit the traffic department to get the matter sorted out. I don t need a R500 traffic fine on my name. he said. Ray Nkonyeni Municipality had not commented at the time of going to press..24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
