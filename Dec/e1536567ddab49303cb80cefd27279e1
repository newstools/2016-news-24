The right-handed teenager lost most of the fingers on that hand when a bullet from a large-calibre firearm exploded last Monday,&nbsp;Netwerk24&nbsp;reported.&nbsp;Darius and a friend were examining the bullet during break at Odensia Primary School. He hit the bullet against a pole. The explosion ripped off his thumb, forefinger, middle finger, and a large part of his ring finger. According to his mother, Erika, the skin was torn off as well.&nbsp;Darius had undergone two operations at Pelonomi Hospital in Bloemfontein. His right hand was attached to his groin so that new skin could grow over it during the next three weeks.&nbsp;He was transferred to Universitas Hospital on Friday.&nbsp;Friends and complete strangers had written to Darius using their "wrong" hand. Lefties wrote with their right hands, and vice versa. &nbsp;&nbsp;The letters were shared with him on social media. Darius thanked everyone in a video message posted on Facebook.&nbsp;Free State police spokesperson Captain Stephen Thakeng said the boy who had brought the bullet to school could face charges under the Firearms Control Act.&nbsp; One of the notes to Darius.
