Lynn.HitchcockLOWER income groups find it more difficult to get through daily life without paying a bribe is the finding of the second South African Citizen s Bribery Survey, conducted by The Ethics Institute and sponsored by Massmart-Walmart. The results show that 48% of the respondents who earn less than R100 000 per annum thought it was difficult to navigate daily life without paying a bribe while only 27% of the higher income group (R500 000 and more per annum) believe the same.Professor Deon Rossouw, CEO of The Ethics Institute, says: Our survey respondents are typically from a wide socioeconomic range so this year we decided to focus specifically on the difference between the experience of bribery of South Africans in higher versus lower income groups. We found that South Africans with lower income find it significantly more difficult to get through everyday life without paying a bribe, particularly with respect to bribes to secure jobs. There is a certain injustice in the fact that those who have the least resources are most vulnerable to being targeted. It is a reflection of the desperation of many in our society and an uncomfortable reminder that the adage 'bread first, morals later' might hold true. According to survey respondents the top five reasons for resorting to bribery are to avoid traffic offences (36%); to secure a job (18%), to obtain a driver s licence (15%); to get a tender (7%), and to receive unauthorised discounts from business (4%). The survey results also show that lower income groups are 17% more vulnerable to paying bribes for jobs, while those with an income of more than R500 000 in turn experience 16% more tender bribery than the low income group.The average bribe was R2 200 an increase of R195 over last year.Bribery for driver s licences was also eight percent higher for the lower income respondents, which according to Prof Rossouw, could reflect the value that a driver's licence has in relation to securing a job at this income level.The survey findings were based on interviews with more than 4553 South Africans from urban centres in Gauteng, Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal, Free State and Western Cape. - Massmart.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
