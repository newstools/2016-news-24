"He (Malema) was instructed to destabilise not only the governing party but the entire country. He is again entrusted with a mammoth task of dethroning the African hero of our liberation, uncle Bob," PAC National Spokesperson Kenneth Mokgatlhe was quoted as saying. &nbsp;&nbsp;Mugabe has ruled Zimbabwe since 1980 when the southern African country attained its independence from Britain.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
