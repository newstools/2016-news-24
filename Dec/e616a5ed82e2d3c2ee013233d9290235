This was after the department bought an equity stake in the business and the land for farm workers as part of the "Strengthening the Relative Rights of People Working the Land" 50/50 policy in the province. The agreement was facilitated by the National Empowerment Fund and is part of a wider plan to secure permanent tenure for farm workers, and for them to have economic interests in the land they live on. "The farm workers as well as the farm dwellers through the formation of the Wijn de Caab Trust, share equal ownership together with established wine farmers Mark Solms (Zandvliet-Delta Farming (Pty) Ltd) and Richard Astor (Lubeck-Delta Ltd)," the department said in a statement. During his visit to the farm Nkwinti was also taken to the farm museum, which tells the story of the slaves who lived on the farm before eventually becoming free people.
