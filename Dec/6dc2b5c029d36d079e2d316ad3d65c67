It was facing a R56.5m deficit, despite the 8% fee increase."It is unsustainable to continue with a 0% increase. The insourcing that will start from the 1st of January already costs the university an additional R100m to R120m," she said.She said the institution had tried its best to cut non-academic budgets, such as support services.Despite this SRC president Kefentse Mkhari rejected the increase and vowed to mobilise students to protest against it in January. &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
