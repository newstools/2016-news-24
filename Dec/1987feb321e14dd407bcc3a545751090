He was suspended from Parliament for five working days.Malema wanted the court to overturn Parliament's decision to remove him for his conduct. In addition, he wanted the court to declare Parliament's employment of ex-police or military personnel to its security services unlawful. The court also rejected this, Mthembu said.Mthembu said the court found the presiding officer acted reasonably and concurred with Parliament that Malema's behaviour was disruptive and warranted his removal.The judge asserted that: &ldquo;the Speaker, in my view, has shown beyond any doubt that there are instances of interference and disruption that justify the removal of a member who hamstrings and incapacitates Parliament from conducting its business&rdquo;.Mthembu said that according to the rules of the House, allegations of improper conduct against other members could not be made without a substantive motion supported by concrete evidence.&ldquo;It is common knowledge that Malema would not have any evidence to support his malicious political posturing, which makes his utterances abusive of the freedom of speech MPs enjoy in the House.&rdquo;EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said they would respond to the ruling later.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
