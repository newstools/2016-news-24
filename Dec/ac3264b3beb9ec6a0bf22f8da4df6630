He lives in exile in neighboring Senegal and could now return home unless the government takes other action.Youssouf Toure, a National Assembly spokesperson, said Saturday that members voted overwhelmingly 104-to-5 not to pursue charges.The allegations against the former president stems from accusations that his leadership had left the military in such a state of disarray that it could not defend Mali against foreign jihadists.
