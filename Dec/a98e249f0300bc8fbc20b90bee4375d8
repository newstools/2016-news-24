This included a meeting with Zuma in London.Cellphone connectionBut the WAU ultimately failed to draw large numbers of platinum mine workers away from Amcu, and the payments made to Maswabi by the covert agents stopped, he claimed. He was left to pay the WAU's debts himself, including the outstanding bills for houses and offices the new union had rented.The defendants, who were represented by the state attorney's office in Pretoria, originally filed a notice of intention to defend Maswabi's claim. But in mid-2016 this reporter received word that Maswabi reached a settlement out of court with Zuma and others.&nbsp;However, News24 recently learnt that Maswabi was pursuing the matter and that it would finally be heard on Friday.Rapport's original investigation found that a cellphone number listed on the WAU's registration document at the Department of Labour belonged to Monde Gadini, husband of Zuma's legal adviser Bonisiwe Makhene.Gadini also happens to be closely associated with the State Security Agency's (SSA) special operations unit, a shadowy intelligence outfit that has come under fire for getting involved in politically-motivated intelligence projects.&nbsp;* This is a developing story.
