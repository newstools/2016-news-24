Trustee of the Al-Imdaad Foundation Qari Ziyaad Patel said he was overwhelmed by the response from South Africans."More than anything else; more than all the pledges coming through, I think for me, as a humanitarian, I would say I've been taken aback by the level of response and the level of care from our South African community," he said. The Al-Imdaad Foundation has been responding to the crisis in Syria since 2011 and is, according to Abramjee, also co-ordinating a visit to Syria "to look at conditions and relief work underway".The fundraising drive also received support and encouragement on social media during the live broadcast on Tuesday evening.The world needs more pledges like #OperationSA.Imagine how many more helpless &amp; homeless could be helped if we put our differences aside "We need to continue this noble legacy and indeed this is a legacy taught to us by Madiba.
