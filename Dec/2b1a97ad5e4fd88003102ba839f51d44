The driver involved in the incident appeared in the Lothair Magistrate's Court, near Witbank, on Tuesday. The case&nbsp;was postponed to January 30."It took so long for the first court case to take place due to the prosecutor repeatedly referring the case back to the police for proper investigation to ensure that a strong case is built," his son Herman van Schalkwyk said.&nbsp;Hermanus van Schalkwyk, 60, was killed on December 23 last year. He was travelling near Amsterdam in Mpumalanga to see his son in Polokwane for Christmas when Mahlobo&rsquo;s blue light convoy crashed into him head-on.&nbsp;An emotional Van Schalkwyk told News24 that he was&nbsp;still shaken by his father&rsquo;s death."The minister just stopped and assisted his staff involved and left the scene, leaving my father to die," Van Schalkwyk said.&nbsp; He said Mahlobo could have helped get paramedics to the scene, which he believed would have saved his father&rsquo;s life.Mahlobo's spokesperson Brian Dube did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
