"In all of Libya's prisons, they hit people and treat them badly, especially black Africans," said Ibrahim Bidane Sy, a migrant who spent three months in one jail."I was in prison without communicating with my family or friends... luckily the IOM helped me to get out," he added.The operation was the second planned mass deportation of Malians from Libya this year.Earlier this month Algeria, Libya's neighbour, deported 260 Malians who also alleged brutality by the police and authorities.African migrants have been regularly expelled by the thousands since Libya's descent into chaos. It is the focal point for migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean to Europe, and was previously home to thousands of Africans working as labourers or domestic servants.After receiving medical treatment by the Malian authorities, the migrants were due to return home to their families on Friday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
