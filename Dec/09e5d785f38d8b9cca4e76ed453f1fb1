With the exception of Afrikaans, for which she got 74%, she got distinctions in all her subjects.&ldquo;I like especially Afrikaans and maths. Because maths is easy and I like reading.&rdquo;Charmain Robbertse, Mikayla&rsquo;s grandmother and foster mother, said on Facebook: &ldquo;Who still doubts that miracles happen and the power of God? Here is our proof. Kayla passes and is promoted.&rdquo;&nbsp;The family moved from Lephalale, Limpopo, to Pretoria last year, to be closer to doctors.&nbsp;They tried to save her middle finger, but decided to amputate it in July this year. It had bent to such an extent that it was touching her palm and severely restricting the use of her hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Things are looking up after the amputation and the use of her hand has improved. However, when she does sums, she still uses that finger, or where it used to be, to count,&rdquo; Robbertse said.&nbsp;A Mozambique spitting cobra's venom causes tissue damage.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
