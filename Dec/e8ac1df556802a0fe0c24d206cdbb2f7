There is a place for humour, undoubtedly, but it is not in this environment,'' Phahlane said for those who may have been taken in by the spoof.Spokesperson Brigadier Sally de Beer said the claim makes a mockery of the sacrifices of the police officers who will be working as usual on these days while others celebrate.The clarification for those who may have been fooled was after the website africannewsupdates.com claimed that Phahlane said nurses would also get the time off, and the sick would have to visit traditional healers.Although the website clearly states in its disclaimer that all of its work is fiction, the slick presentation often fools people into sharing the information thinking it is real.''Lieutenant General Phahlane has directed that the SAPS places it on record that we distance ourselves from such reports and find this type of misguided humour tasteless and misleading,'' said De Beer.She added that the police had actually stepped up policing efforts over the festive season, and won't be resting with their families.Other claims on the website are that President Jacob Zuma is releasing 20 000 prisoners for Christmas and the release of a DIY home circumcision kit. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
