Rose continued to pray with the commuters before getting behind the wheel and he was subsequently suspended prior to his dismissal.Following arbitration, he lost his case at the Commission for Concillitaion, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA).&ldquo;I have had lawyers contacting me to take up my battle for me, but I have decided to allow God&rsquo;s will to be done. If he wants it to go further, it will go further. But for now, I just pray for guidance,&rdquo; he said.Positive outlookAfter his case concluded in February, he worked as a taxi driver in Atlantis, did a welding course and made some money from casual labour.&ldquo;I am surviving. My family eats every night and while we don&rsquo;t have in abundance, we have enough. God provides for us every day,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Whatever is meant for me will come my way. He has a plan and I must just be patient.&rdquo;After his highly publicised dismissal in December, he received a flood of job offers, Rose recalled.&ldquo;But none of them worked out. Some told me they would get back to me but never did. I don&rsquo;t have any hard feelings because of it &ndash; if it was meant to be, it would be.&rdquo;He was also approached by a well-known water company who offered him a job as a truck driver.&ldquo;They required someone with a Code 14 licence, but mine is Code 11. They are trying to arrange for me to do my truck drivers licence without any charge to me, even the lessons will be free,&rdquo; Rose said.But on the road is not where his heart is.&ldquo;My dream job would be to work with the less fortunate and people going through difficult circumstances to show them God&rsquo;s way. Twelve years ago I was where they are &ndash; a gangster, drug addict and alcohol abuser. I lived recklessly,&rdquo; Rose remembered.&ldquo;But look at God and what he did for me. He changed my path and put me on a road where I am happy and grateful for His blessings. I want to help people who are lost and don&rsquo;t know where to turn to. But only if that is God&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;If he could do it all over again, he would still start his trip with a prayer for God to bless his passengers and their journey, Rose insisted.&ldquo;My faith and His work is what are most important to me,&rdquo; he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
