They are lions who fight crime every day. But due to what Zuma did to the justice system, these lions are now lead by donkeys &ndash; and corrupt donkeys at that," O&rsquo;Sullivan said.Head of the AfriForum anti-corruption unit, Monique Taute, claimed: "Zuma is in control of the NPA and the Hawks."The report further claims that Hawks head Lieutenant General Mthandazo Ntlemeza, chief of detectives Lieutenant General Vinesh Moonoo, Gauteng Hawks head Prince Mokotedi, Police Minister Nathi Nhleko, and NPA head Shaun Abrahams could be charged with racketeering, corruption and defeating the ends of justice.Taute said, because the justice system "has been captured by criminals," it was not likely that anything would come of this report if it was only handed to the SAPS. That is why they would also hand it to the Public Protector&rsquo;s office for further investigation.O&rsquo;Sullivan said the only law enforcement agency in the country that was currently "free from political interference" was the Independent Police Investigative Directorate.Millions had been spent over the last couple of years on unnecessary court cases that the state had lost, O'Sullivan said.&ldquo;We see more and more that state resources are used to illegally charge people who want to expose corruption.&rdquo;"This is why Zuma wants South Africa to withdraw from the ICC. We will send the report to the ICC. Why? Because what is happening in South Africa today is spying on civilians and state-sponsored abuses of civilians&rsquo; human rights," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
