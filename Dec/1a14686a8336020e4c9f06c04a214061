He has stopped taking instructions from the political leadership of the city that was voted into office during the recent local government elections," he said."The youth league will not tolerate anyone who does not prioritise the development of our people and the youth in particular. The idea that the city manager can blatantly refuse to implement decisions of his political principals is of great concern," he added.Cibane applauded the move by Gumede to remove Sithole.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
