The South African Human Rights Commission and the new Health Ombudsman were also probing the matter.The UN experts were concerned that the findings of the investigation were not yet available."We urge the authorities to provide the results of any judicial and other independent investigation as soon as possible, and to explain what measures they have taken to prevent further casualties and protect the rights of those affected by this situation."The Office of the Health Ombudsman was not immediately able to confirm the status of the investigation.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
