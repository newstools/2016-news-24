But only the privileged can buy new clothes and decide what to cook and drink on Christmas Day.&ldquo;As for us, we will drink water&hellip; it won&rsquo;t make any difference,&rdquo; says Ingabire. &ldquo;Raising money for rent this month of December is my priority.&rdquo;Ingabire says her&nbsp;little girl complains about having to wear clothes the family is given. &ldquo;She was refusing to wear those oversized dark coloured trousers and top, saying it&rsquo;s for a boy. But what choice do I have? Whatever people bring from church for her, she should be grateful.&rdquo;Ingabire does part-time domestic work and her two older daughters, aged 16 and 18, work three shifts a week at a restaurant in Panorama&nbsp;to help pay for transport to school and for fees, uniforms and stationery.Ingabire is receiving notices of demand for school fees.

Shops run out of clothes and groceries in the festive season buying spree.&ldquo;In my country Christmas was a party day. I had a very big house. People would come and eat at my house.&rdquo;&ldquo;Look how happy my kids are in these past photos. Now that I have come to live this cheap life, my kids are miserable.
