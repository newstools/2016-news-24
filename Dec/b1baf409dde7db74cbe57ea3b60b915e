After hearing the testimony of several high-profile witnesses, the ongoing Parliamentary inquiry into the SABC wrapped up with the ad hoc committee's final take before adjourning until next year. Jump to bottom The scheduled briefing by the Parliamentary ad hoc committee to wrap up the SABC inquiry for this year, has been cancelled. The committee chair said he had covered everything in their final thoughts during the session.&nbsp;Heh. From Rachel Kalidass&#39;s testimony, it would appear that some of the minutes provided to the #SABCinquiry have been doctored. Incredible!#SABCinquiry begins last day of hearings before Christmas break. Former b member Rachel Kalidass &amp; editor Sophie Mokoena to testify. @News24ICYMI:&nbsp;Muthambi ducks questions on last SABC board member&nbsp;Communications Minister Faith Muthambi on Wednesday dodged and ducked all questions pointedly asking her for opinion on the current, and only, SABC board member. Instead, she called on Parliament to fast-track the process of determining the SABC board s fitness to hold office, and appoint an interim board. One thing she was unwavering about was that she was fit and proper to be a shareholder representative of the SABC, she told the ad hoc committee investigating the current board s fitness to hold office. Committee chairperson Vincent Smith and ANC MP Fezeka Loliwe asked her if she thought the current chairperson and the only member of the board remaining, Mbulaheni Maguvhe, was fit for the job.&nbsp; Jump to top
