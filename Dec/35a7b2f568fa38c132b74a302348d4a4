The pigs, which were being transported from Du Noon to Langa, are currently receiving treatment at the Cape of Good Hope SPCA farmyard."A hugely distressed boar was in the back of the station wagon, in a state of collapse. His temperature had soared to 39&deg;C and he was displaying symptoms of heat stroke," she said."In the trailer, they found two fully grown sows with their legs bound with bailing twine which had also been used to muzzle the sows and attach their snouts to the body of the trailer."'Tethering, mode of transport caused suffering'Abraham said the four men transporting the pigs initially claimed they did not speak English or Afrikaans and were unco-operative, threatening and aggressive towards the inspectors, with one commenting, "Enjoy your Christmas, if you see it"."In spite of their threats, the boar was immediately moved into the SPCA vehicle where he was hosed down with water in an attempt to cool him down. When the sows, [with] increased respiratory rates indicating massive trauma and stress, were untied it was clear that the tethering and mode of transport had resulted in immense suffering for them," she explained."They must have felt every bump along the road as the bailing twine caused lacerations to their muzzles, glutes, hocks and ears."One sow also had injuries to her tail and hind quarters, which Abraham said was most likely a result of cannibalism; a sign that she had been held at a place with insufficient space to house pigs or one whose environment was inadequately enriched.The men arrived at the SPCA's farmyard on Wednesday to collect the animals with more appropriate transport means. However, the pigs were not given back to them.The animal welfare organisation hopes to have the owners as well as the farmer who sold the pigs charged under the Animal Protection Act, Abraham said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
