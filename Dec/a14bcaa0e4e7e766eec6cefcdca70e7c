Kabila came to power in 2001 after his father Laurent was assassinated. He was elected in 2006 to his first five-year term under a constitution that sets a two-term limit for presidents.Ban called on Congolese security forces to show the "utmost restraint" after dozens of people were killed in violence over past months.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
