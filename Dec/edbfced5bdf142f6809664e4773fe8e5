Today&rsquo;s session contributes to that process of reflection,&rdquo; Zuma said. He was speaking at an ANC Youth League Economic Freedom Lecture at the Olive Convention Centre in Durban. &ldquo;Each ANC conference takes stock of progress made and what else needed to be done to achieve this particular goal or other goals&hellip;.&rdquo;Zuma said the ANC Youth League was reminding the government that there were policies that were recorded.&ldquo;The issue was what happened with the implementation of the correct policies?&rdquo;He said the fact &ldquo;that the minority white were in control was not a surprise&rdquo;.&ldquo;As the youth, for you to ask what has since happened is correct. If nothing has happened ... what then do we need to do to implement these policies?&rdquo;Zuma told the more than 2000 people that some could say the ANC had done a lot in the last 22 years to transform society and some would differ. &nbsp;&ldquo;We reiterate that the political freedom gained in 1994 is not complete without the attainment of economic freedom,&rdquo; Zuma said.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
