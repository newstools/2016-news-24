Her body was left on a footbridge leading to Driftsands, which is surrounded by a nature reserve.More than 1 300 signatures were collected ahead of the appearance of Mdani's appearance,&nbsp;but because he abandoned his bail application, it was not used in court.Mdani was&nbsp;remanded&nbsp;in custody, to the relief of most of those present in court, and&nbsp;the case would be heard again on 15 February.Recovering from assaultCox said it would have been nice to show Magistrate Vincent Ketye how much effort the community had gone to to show that they did not want Mdani out on bail.All the people in the packed court,&nbsp;aside from&nbsp;three&nbsp;members of&nbsp;Mdani's family, had made the trip from Driftsands to show that they care about the case. ''They are not all lesbian or gay, they just want to send a strong message from the community,'' said Cox.Zuko Mnukwa, chairperson of Driftsands Youth in Action, said he and other residents were shocked when Mdani was arrested. ''We were shocked to find that we live with him,'' he said. ''But it is a relief that there was no bail.''It was initially thought that Swelindawo may have fallen victim to homophobes, but a possible motive for her murder will likely only emerge during a trial. More involvedShe was already recovering from an assault the day before she was abducted.Investigations&nbsp;into her murder are continuing&nbsp;and the post mortem results are&nbsp;still outstanding, but Cox said the feeling was that there must have been more people involved in her killing.It was hoped that if so, they would also be arrested.Cox said the LGBTI community in Driftsands was especially shocked at Swelindawo's murder because out of 19 "safe zones" in the province, the area had one of the most successful.Fellow activist Lebohang Lehana said their ''safe zone'' work zones, also known as ''solidarity circles'', for LGBTI people, included holding talks on the dangers of recreational drugs, and teaching the community about how they may stygmatise people.For more information on creating an LGBTI ''safe zone'' click here. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
