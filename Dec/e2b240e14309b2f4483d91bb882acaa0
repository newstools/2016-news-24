We express our condolences to the family and community of the slain councillor."Dube-Ncube called on law enforcement agencies to bring Khumalo's killer to book and urged the community to keep calm."We...call upon the leadership of the area to work together to ensure peace and stability in the area... We are indeed shocked that in this day and age, people can still murder councillors."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
