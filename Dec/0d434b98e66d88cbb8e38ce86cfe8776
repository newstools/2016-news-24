At least 14 000 delegates selected by their clans elect parliament members, who elect the president.Officials have said voting for members of the upper house is almost complete, while that for the lower house is just past the halfway mark.Somalia has been trying to rebuild after recently establishing its first functioning central government since 1991, when warlords overthrew a longtime dictator and plunged the impoverished nation into chaos.The election delays have worried some in the international community, which has expressed interest in having the votes carried out this year.But some clans and candidates have continued to file complaints over the process. Allegations of corruption and manipulation abound, leading to warnings by the electoral commission that some elected seats may be nullified because of allegations that candidates paid bribes to sway voters.Opposition leaders have insisted that the ongoing process to elect lawmakers is marred by fraud in favor of the current administration's hand-picked members.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
