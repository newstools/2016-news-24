I am confident that we will find a solution to the problem," Kenyatta said.But even as the president spoke, the chairman of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union, Samuel Oroko, stormed out of a meeting with health ministry officials saying the talks had collapsed after union officials learned that the government was seeking court orders to arrest them."We shall not negotiate until the government withdraws any court issues in good faith," Oroko said.The majority of people in this East African country cannot afford private health care, and the strike has put emergency cases at higher risk of death. On first day of the strike, 87 patients escaped from the country's sole psychiatric hospital.Doctors and nurses have complained for a decade about low pay, and thousands have taken jobs abroad. Kenyans often criticize politicians for seeking treatment abroad, saying they show no faith in the health care system at home.On social media, health care workers and the public have accused the government of being slow to raise salaries while being quick to pay inflated contracts from suspect companies doing business with the health ministry, which is being investigated for corruption.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
