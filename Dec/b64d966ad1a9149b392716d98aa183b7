Sch&auml;fer said that there was, however, nothing preventing schools from&nbsp;getting parents to collect the report cards at the school. Schools may then use this opportunity to discuss outstanding fees, but may not refuse to release the report cards afterwards.&nbsp; "If the reports are then withheld for any reason, the department will investigate complaints and will take further action as required," Sch&auml;fer said.&nbsp; "I understand and sympathise with many schools that are battling to collect school fees from parents, especially when some parents can clearly afford them, but discriminating against a learner for the financial decisions or position of a parent will not be tolerated." "I would, however, like to appeal to parents to try and settle their outstanding fees, if they are in the position to do so." "Schools can take legal action against parents who owe fees and who do not qualify for exemption or partial exemption," she said. The Western Cape academic year is set to end on Wednesday, December 7, when schools&nbsp;are&nbsp;set to&nbsp;issue report cards to learners.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
