It looked like all of us who are in the alliance, we don&rsquo;t seem to see that it&rsquo;s something that must be corrected within the movement."He praised ANC NEC members for debating calls for Zuma to step down.Nehawu was however not overly concerned about the outcomes of the ANC NEC meeting, held between November 26 and 28, which reaffirmed its confidence in Zuma. "The outcome is not so important. What is important is that the ANC itself thinks that it can no longer ignore this matter that society is crying about."Nehawu said it was concerned about the party ignoring its veterans. They were called "empty tins" who lacked struggle credentials when they demanded Zuma be removed."We are very pleased this matter is being discussed and we will indeed respect the manner in which the ANC wishes to handle the matter."Nehawu held its central executive committee meeting this week, at which it reiterated its call for Zuma to do the "honourable" thing and step down.WATCH:&nbsp;Talks about Zuma's leadership show progress in the ANCIt believed that ANC deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa should occupy the Union Buildings and unify the party and the country. He is the one who should lead the transition to an "overwhelming victory" in the 2019 national elections, Nehawu general secretary Bereng Soke said.While the trade union was under no illusions that Ramaphosa could singlehandedly resolve the ills facing the ANC, it would be a major starting point in turning the tide against factionalism in the party.Efforts to renew the ANC had to start in earnest at its national policy conference next year. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
