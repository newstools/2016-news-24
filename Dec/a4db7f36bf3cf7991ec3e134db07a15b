Kenyatta came to power in 2013 amid a wave of resentment at perceived attempts by the West to influence elections.At the time Kenyatta and his deputy, William Ruto, were facing crimes against humanity charges at the International Criminal Court for allegedly orchestrating violence after the December 2007 flawed election in which former president Mwai Kibaki claimed victory over Odinga. More than 1 000 people died and 600 000 were evicted from their homes. Kenyatta and Ruto were on opposing sides of the conflict but joined forces after they were named suspects.Their campaigns spread the message that the ICC charges were meant to clear the way for Odinga. A comment by a US diplomat that "choices have consequences" were taken by some Kenyans as a caution to voters against electing a president who faced such charges before the international court and was used as an example of the West's interference.The charges against the two have since been dropped, but the ICC prosecutor says the lack of evidence was caused by unprecedented witness interference and intimidation.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
