Maswabi has claimed that he'd been instructed to establish the WAU, partly with the assistance of agents from the State Security Agency (SSA).However, the funding provided by Zuma and the other defendants allegedly stopped, leaving Maswabi in debt.According to Maswabi's particulars of claim filed at court, a SSA agent facilitated the first meeting between him and other would-be members of the union and Zuma in September 2013.The alleged meeting took place at the Union Buildings. There were a total of four meetings with Zuma throughout September and October 2013, according to court papers.Undermine AmcuThe alleged meetings were held in the wake of the Marikana massacre in 2012 and in the context of the ongoing violent strikes in the platinum sector."The first defendant (Zuma) had indicated that the police, army and intelligence will work hand-in-hand with the plaintiffs (Maswabi and the WAU) to bring stability within the platinum belt for the interest of the national economy," reads the particulars of claim.The new union's mandate seemed to be very much centred on destabilising Amcu.&nbsp;&ldquo;To willfully plot and then implement moves deliberately designed to create division amongst workers are the actions of persons who not only undermine their oath of office, but who also undermine South African labour law, and the international conventions it has endorsed on the Freedom of Association and many other matters,&rdquo; Vavi said.He said it was clear there were attempts to undermine Amcu, and no expense was spared in doing so."The fact that the money promised to the Trade Union Mercenaries dried up and caused the brand new Workers Association Union to then flounder, does not detract from the fact that no 1 was behaving not like an elected President, but like a gangster, using whatever means at his disposal to promote a &lsquo;sweetheart&rsquo; union at the expense of the tax payer, including miners in platinum.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
