There were basic things we knew are wrong to do and ones that are correct.Every child belonged to the community, not only to the parents. We would respect every elder as if they were our own parents or relatives.Generations and ways of doing things have changed so drastically that older men can no longer differentiate between a girl and a grown-up woman. The same fathers who should guide our children are the ones who destroy our girls by becoming their blessers. This is a form of abuse, as elders use their powers to get what they want, and others use the situation of poverty to their advantage.It is very disturbing to learn that cases of abuse are increasing despite so many awareness campaigns held annually. Can we say this is an issue of ignorance from the perpetrators? Have we reached the stage of accepting abuse and made it part of our lives so that it becomes difficult to differentiate between abuse and a norm? Are the perpetrators taking advantage because they think that the justice system imposes lenient sentences on perpetrators?As responsible citizens, all of us need to go back to basics and treat each child as our own, protect each woman we come across and encourage other men to be man enough and stop doing these acts. If we work toge ther and stand in unity, we can beat this monster. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
