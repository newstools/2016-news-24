Kadazera confirmed that Murekezi, who has been living in Malawi since 2003 and holds a Malawian passport, was wanted in Rwanda on "genocide issues".The 1994 Rwandan genocide was a four-month slaughter that left 800 000 people dead. It was triggered by the shooting down of the plane of then president Juvenal Habyarimana in April 1994.It was not immediately clear if or when Murekezi, now a businessman, would be extradited to Rwanda.Dalitso Kabambe, a top official in Malawi's foreign affairs ministry, said in a statement that his country had received "several requests for extradition" from Rwanda, but was not sure whether Murekezi's name was amongst them.A Malawi immigration spokesman, Joseph Chauwa was last month quoted by a local newspaper saying Murekezi had "met all the requirements for the awarding of citizenship and a travel document".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
