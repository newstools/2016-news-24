A Zimbabwe Independent report said that Grace together with her son Russell Goreraza have gone to war with the Lebanese gem dealer Jamal Ahmed over the  diamond ring which was meant to be Mugabe's wedding anniversary present to Grace. The year 2016 marked the 20th anniversary of the Mugabes' wedding. The report said that Grace had been sued together with Russel (1st repondent) and Kennedy Fero (3rd respondent), who according to court papers, was part of Grace's security personnel.
