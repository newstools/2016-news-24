Libya sank into lawlessness and divisions after the downfall of long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.The fresh clashes sent tanks and convoys of armed militiamen streaming into the streets.The two sides were split between rival militias vying for control of the city: One has its origins in Tripoli, while the other side is led by forces originally from the western city of Misrata and has Islamist leanings.Unconfirmed social media reports said that one of the militia groups had since taken over the north African country&rsquo;s central bank as the ongoing fighting escalated.
