She urged officials to have the "willingness to look further than their narrow political agendas". "The councillors need to realise that the local community is not interested in the ongoing political theatre which prompted our intervention in Nquthu in the first place. The local residents want a functional municipality which is what the new councillors were elected to deliver in August 2016," said Dube-Ncube.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
