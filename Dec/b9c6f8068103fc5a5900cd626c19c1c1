At the end, a man is heard speaking and a blurry, bearded face can be seen before it ends.The teens were driving on a spare tyre, said Pennsylvania State Trooper Dave Peters. State police initially reported the teens were driving with a flat tire, but it's now unclear if that was the case. The fiery wreck badly damaged the car, making it difficult to determine its original condition, Peters said.The video has been taken off Hughes' Facebook page. State police say they will use the footage in their investigation.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
