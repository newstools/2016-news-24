Malema went on to form his own party, the Economic Freedom Fighters, and the league has had to claw its way back into the political space.Sinyangana said the station benefits immensely from community participation and thanked the league for joining the growing group of civic-minded people in the community.After the police station, the league delivered some rice and maize meal to startled resident Feziwe Gxotshiwe who lives in a quiet close in Nyanga. The mother of four blinked at the cameras snapping away in front of her as Moela asked how she was managing with four children to look after and no job.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
