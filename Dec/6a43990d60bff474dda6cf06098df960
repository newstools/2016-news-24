Jeff Wicks, News24Durban - Unruly behaviour by some in Parliament does not conform with teachings of the Bible, President Jacob Zuma told thousands of members of the Twelve Apostles in Christ church at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on Sunday. &nbsp;It was Zuma's first public appearance after an ANC NEC meeting 10 days ago in which several ministers in his Cabinet led a call for him to step down.&nbsp;Speaking through an interpreter, Zuma said that the country's democratic Constitution should be lauded.&nbsp;President Jacob Zuma takes the podium at the Twelve Apostles in Christ thanksgiving celebration @News24 pic.twitter.com/G338G858St"Next week we will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of our democratic Constitution," Zuma said."The chief apostle [of the church]&nbsp;spoke at length about the content of our Constitution.&nbsp;The Constitution grants our people the rights that ensure they enjoy a life they never could before."&nbsp;Zuma said that it was up to government to ensure that what is in the Constitution was realised.&nbsp;"The Constitution says that we should be united as the people of South Africa. I am happy that the chief apostle spoke at length about how politicians should behave. He gave us wisdom. Our behavior should be acceptable to society and to God."He explained that what is happening in Parliament is unacceptable. I really wish that this teaching was listened to by everyone in South Africa," Zuma said.&nbsp;Sittings of Parliament have been regularly disrupted by opposition parties, particularly the Economic Freedom Fighters.&nbsp;The church held their annual thanksgiving celebration on Sunday with a range of political figures present, including KwaZulu-Natal Premier Willies Mchunu and eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede.&nbsp;Zuma and other politicos at the @MMStadium ahead of his expected address ??Msizi Zondi @News24 pic.twitter.com/ZmKAqSj20OSpeakers, including chief apostle Ceasar Nongqunga, defended Zuma and the ANC.&nbsp;Nongqunga said that it was not a sin for the government to upgrade the home of the president, a clear reference to the Nkandla scandal.He called for an end to political violence and called for forgiveness for all, including Zuma.&nbsp;In her welcoming address, Gumede stuck to the same line, asking congregants to pray for Zuma as he was "under attack from the devil".Thousands descend on the @MMStadium for the Twelve Apostles in Christ thanksgiving ceremony @News24 pic.twitter.com/cpRyvgN9Vg24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
