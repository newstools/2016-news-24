Why won't we do the same in 2017?&rdquo; the department's spokesperson Madikwe Mabotha said.However, Mabotha could not confirm when the department would release details on the funding scheme for students in the R0 - R600 000 bracket.In September Minster Blade Nzimande said the department would fund the fee increase for all students with a household income below R600 000."Government is committed to finding the resources to support children of all poor, working and middle class families &ndash; those with a household income of up to R600 000 per annum &ndash; with subsidy funding to cover the gap between the 2015 fee and the adjusted 2017 fee at their institution," Nzimande said.However Wits student representative council president Kefentse Mkhari questioned how the plan would work."Who falls in the 0 &ndash; R600 000 bracket? Do I only have to pay when I'm not on Nsfas [National Student Financial Aid Scheme]?" Mkhari asked, speaking to News 24 on Tuesday."It doesn't really make sense." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
