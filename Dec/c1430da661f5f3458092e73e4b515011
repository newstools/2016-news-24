Administrator   THE case of alleged rape against a 42-year-old local pastor, believed to be a pastor in the Newtown area, was withdrawn on 24 November in the KwaDukuza Magistrate’s Court. The pastor was arrested in December 2015 for allegedly raping a 15-year-old girl earlier last year.  He was granted R3000 bail and made an appearance in court in February. The mother of the alleged victim confirmed with Weekly that the case had been withdrawn.  She said the case was withdrawn because she did not appear with her child on 24 November because she felt her child was being victimised and she could tell they would lose the case. The pastor said the mother and the accused never arrived for court on two dates, 29 August and 24 November, so the case was subsequently withdrawn. He said the incident affected his family and work as a pastor. The pastor said he would not take action against his accuser and her mother, but offered words of counsel to the public. “I just want to tell people that they must always stand with God because their faith will see them through,” he said. Also offering advice in light of the accusations against her husband, the pastor’s wife called on parents, especially mothers, to look after their daughters and ensure that they teach their daughters to accept their mistakes rather than shift the blame on others. The pair claimed when the accusation was made against the pastor they had just moved into the building where the accuser and her mother lived and they do not know why such an allegation was levelled against the pastor.     24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
