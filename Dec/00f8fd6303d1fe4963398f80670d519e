The incidents occurred during McBride's term as Ekurhuleni metro police chief.Reports emerged that senior police and Hawks investigators have been conspiring to falsely implicate McBride in the attempted murder case.Defeating the ends of justiceA whistleblower told Eyewitness News he was contacted by a police lieutenant colonel in 2007 to draft an affidavit to implicate McBride in the attempted murder of cash-in-transit kingpin Marco Singh.Singh was arrested while McBride was metropolitan police chief.The State withdrew charges against McBride and his two co-accused, former director of investigations Matthew Sesoko and former head of Ipid in Limpopo Innocent Khuba, in November.The trio was under investigation by the Hawks' crimes against the state (Cats) unit for fraud and defeating the ends of justice in their investigation of former Hawks head Lieutenant General Anwa Dramat.Dramat was accused of involvement in the illegal rendition of Zimbabwean nationals in 2010.The findings contained in the last report on the matter, and which McBride signed, exonerated Dramat and differed greatly from an earlier report implicating him in the renditions.According to a report by law firm Werksmans Attorneys, portions of statements by individuals who implicated Dramat in the illegal renditions and which appeared in the first report were left out of the second report.McBride has maintained that the earlier report did not take all the facts into account.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
