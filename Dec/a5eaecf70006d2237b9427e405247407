Mphumzi Maqungo retained his treasurer position, while Karl Cloete was re-elected deputy general secretary.Ruth Ntlokotse was elected second deputy president, the only position that was contested during the congress.The union declared it would rapidly implement the resolutions taken at the congress, which included building a &ldquo;Marxist-Leninist vanguard revolutionary workers party&rdquo;.It said its immediate task was to re-assert the Freedom Charter as the basic programme of the national democratic revolution, in order to unite all those who had suffered the effects of colonial dispossession and imperialist domination.The ANC-led alliance had abandoned its programme, Numsa said.&nbsp;&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
