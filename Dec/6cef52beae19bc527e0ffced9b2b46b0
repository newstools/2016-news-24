We will continue, today."Following the resumption of the meeting, Maguvhe laid another complaint.He said the documents the inquiry would be using this week, including the Auditor General's report and the Public Protector's report, were not in Braille, and would "jeopardise" him.Maguvhe is partially blind.Smith&nbsp;replied that&nbsp;SABC secretary Theresa Geldenhuys had notified the committee on November 18 before Maguvhe was scheduled to appear that they would transcribe the documents into Braille themselves, and therefore denied his late request.Executive members, including Maguvhe, acting CEO James Aguma and chief executive of corporate affairs Hlaudi Motsoeneng, then&nbsp;walked out.SABC members including Prof Maguvhe and Hlaudi Motsoeneng walk out of #SABCinquiry. @News24 pic.twitter.com/JVpGr9qHOO&mdash; Paul Herman (@PaulTHerman) December 7, 2016SABC members including Prof Maguvhe and Hlaudi Motsoeneng walk out of #SABCinquiry. @News24 pic.twitter.com/JVpGr9qHOOExpedited appealSmith told the ad hoc committee earlier on Wednesday that Judge Siraj Desai had not given reasons yet for his decision to reject Maguvhe's interdict request."If that is the position, I'm unclear on what basis an appeal could have been made," he had said.Smith said it was the opinion of Parliament's legal counsel to proceed cautiously, with a preference to expedite the appeal in the High Court before proceeding with the hearings.All MPs who spoke agreed that Parliament's legal team should expedite the appeal process "as soon as possible".DA MPs Mike Waters and Phumzile van Damme wanted the committee to still proceed on Wednesday, as there was no court order to halt the inquiry.IFP MP Narend Singh, though, said it was important for Parliament to respect the right of a citizen to appeal a decision, to maintain the moral high ground.EFF MP Fana Mokoena said Maguvhe needed to provide reasons to Parliament as to his decision, in his personal capacity, given that there was no longer a board.A representative from the auditor general was speaking at the time the SABC walked out of the inquiry.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
