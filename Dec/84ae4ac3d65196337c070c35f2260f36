This after he was unable to get a loan from work.Oliver allegedly ran into co-accused Jonathan Jonas before the robbery.He told the court he had grabbed Bl&ouml;chliger from behind in a chokehold until she lost consciousness.Bl&ouml;chliger dragged into fynbosWhen the teen regained consciousness, Jonas allegedly told her to hand over her personal items. She gave him her ring and watch.Oliver said he never asked Jonas &ndash; apparently armed with a gun - to accompany or help him.In his affidavit, he said he attempted to convince Jonas to put the gun away as it would "make everything worse".Jonas allegedly then turned the gun on him and Bl&ouml;chliger, who was dragged into the fynbos where the gunman allegedly shoved her face into the ground and raped her.Jonas laughed and shook his head as he listened to the testimony against him.Oliver also claimed that Jonas had made numerous threats against him, but Coetzee countered that he was "not the victim in jail that he would like the court to believe".He said he received information that Oliver was "popular" behind bars.Stalled plea deal talksIt was also discovered that Oliver had smuggled a cellphone into jail upon his arrest by hiding the device in his anus. In October alone, six other cellphones were found near him.Coetzee said he believed Oliver was a flight risk, had no fixed address and was now unemployed.Oliver had previously been in talks with the State about a plea deal, but these stalled after the prosecution would not budge on life imprisonment.Co-accused Jerome Moses was finalising a plea and sentencing agreement for possession of stolen property. He had apparently helped Oliver sell the stolen cellphone.Last month, he was granted relaxed bail conditions to allow him to be treated at a drug rehabilitation centre in Elsies River until January 20.The fourth accused, Daniel Easter, would plead guilty to possession of stolen property for having Bl&ouml;chliger's cellphone, which he allegedly bought from Oliver and Moses.The matter was postponed to Tuesday for closing arguments. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
