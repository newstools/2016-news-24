According to Sgt Lungi Ngidi, the Gun Run, held on Wednesday (07/12), was started many years ago by the Air Defence Artillery Formation, which was 6 Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment. The main aim of the Gun Run was to raise funds to enable the unit to visit one of the Air Defence Artillery Units overseas. It became a tradition in the Air Defence Artillery Formation to host the Gun Run every year as a show of fitness, as well as esprit de corps, Ngindi said. The team that wins first place must always defend their title the following year. The Men for Change organisation and the AIDS awareness campaign organisation used to be part of the initiative. Two teams consisting of only females are reported to have been the highlight of this year s initiative.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
