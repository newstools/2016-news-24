Officers pursued the man, who fled when police tried to pull him over. "He drove off at a high speed and a chase ensued along the Sun City road. When he was cornered and pulled off the road, he allegedly shot himself in the head with the firearm believed to be the one used during the farm attack," Ngoepe said. He was taken to hospital and is being treated under police guard.Mahlangu said right-wing organisations "have opportunistically and for political expedience [chosen] to characterise farm murders not as a crime against which all South Africans should unite but as white genocide".&nbsp;"Unfortunately, some own goals have mostly contributed to a resurgence of racism that undermines peaceful co-existence within our communities, unity, reconciliation, nation building and social cohesion," he said. &nbsp; "Vigilance in farming communities as well as among role players involved in rural safety will eliminate the threat of opportunistic crime particularly during the festive season."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
