Staff ReporterA drag race patrol ended in a high speed chase and bullets flying between Ghost Squad members and fleeing passengers whose car crashed into a police vehicle on Friday night in Athlone following the chase.This is according to Traffic Services spokesperson, Maxine Jordaan. "At approximately 23:15 on Friday 2 December officers attached to the Ghost Squad unit were patrolling Klipfontein Road, Athlone, as part of a drag racing operation."The officers spotted a Blue Opel Astra (CY357491) driving along Klipfontein Road without any headlights at night. The officers attempted to conduct a routine traffic stop. The driver of the Astra refused to stop after numerous requests to do so, and a high speed chase ensued," Jordaan said.She added the suspects were then pursued through Klipfontein, Calendula and Ruby roads into 7th Avenue, until they drove into a dead end in 8th Avenue."The suspect(s) tried to take evasive action and reversed into the oncoming patrol car in an attempt to evade capture. Both vehicles came to a halt on impact."The left rear passenger in the Astra then fired multiple shots at the officers from their car. His bullets struck the left passenger door of the patrol car and the officers then jumped out of their immobilised vehicle and drew their firearms. Officers retaliated," Jordaan said.No-one was injured in the exchange of fire, but the five occupants of the Astra all ran away on foot trying to evade capture, Jordaan added.The officers arrested four men, but the fifth suspect, a woman, escaped on foot, she said."Two firearms were recovered on [the] scene: one black and silver 9mm Rugar and ammunition with the serial numbers filed off and a 9mm pellet gun. Suspects have been charged with attempted murder, possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition, possession of an imitation firearm, tampering with a firearm serial number, reckless or negligent driving and resisting arrest."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
