However on Friday Jammeh announced that he no longer accepted the election results and called for another vote, saying there were irregularities.Jammeh's ruling APRC party said late Saturday that it will follow up Jammeh's rejection of the election results by filing a petition to the Supreme Court. By law, election results can be contested up to 10 days after the vote.Gambia's president-elect Barrow said on Saturday that Jammeh has no constitutional authority to invalidate the vote, or to call for a new one, and called on him for a smooth handover of power in the interest of the country's peace and stability.Senegal's president Macky Sall joined a chorus of calls for Jammeh to respect election results and step down peacefully in Gambia, where tens of thousands of Senegalese reside.Senegal's foreign ministry, the United Nations Security Council, West Africa's regional bloc and Gambia's diaspora community have all called on Jammeh to respect the Gambian people's choice, and on security forces and others to exercise restraint, remain calm and avoid violence. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
