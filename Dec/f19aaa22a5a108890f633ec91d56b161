It doesn't come as a surprise that the recent allegations have been made,&rdquo; the head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) told reporters in Pretoria.McBride was responding to Gauteng Hawks head Prince Mokotedi&rsquo;s claims of espionage and high treason against him, former Gauteng Hawks head Shadrack Sibiya, and private investigator Paul O&rsquo;Sullivan.Mokotedi suggested O'Sullivan was trying to force President Jacob Zuma to step down by orchestrating a revolt against him.Mokotedi&rsquo;s allegations were contained in an affidavit which formed the basis of a criminal case, which was opened at the Bedfordview police station, Johannesburg, on Monday.Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi confirmed on Tuesday that the case had been opened.The affidavit, deposed by Mokotedi, details a secret meeting O&rsquo;Sullivan, McBride, and Sibiya held at a house in Bedfordview which once belonged to Czech fugitive Radovan Krecjir.In it, Mokotedi claims that members of Afriforum and the DA were party to the surreptitious rendezvous, aimed at identifying certain people &ldquo;as targets for vexatious criminal investigations and shaming in the media&rdquo;.The intention was to put pressure on politicians to have the &ldquo;targeted individuals&rdquo; removed from office, Mokotedi says in his affidavit.&ldquo;It was disclosed by the group that Paul O&rsquo;Sullivan has collected damaging evidence against Mr Duduzane Zuma, the president&rsquo;s son, and that information can be used to mobilise the community to revolt and pressure the president to quit office.&rdquo;However, McBride said this had to be rejected.McBride said a meeting did take place at a house in Bedfordview, but it was not linked in any way to subjects detailed in Mokotedi's affidavit.McBride said he was not sure if DA and Afriforum members were at the meeting, as several people were present.He said O'Sullivan was a complainant in a number of cases and they would regularly meet him to help the Ipid with its investigations.McBride challenged Mokotedi to do a polygraph test live on TV.&ldquo;We have no fear on this. This would collapse, we are unafraid, we are unintimidated,&rdquo; he said.Mokotedi was parachuted into his position following the departure of Sibiya. He was fired last year following a disciplinary hearing which found him guilty of orchestrating the renditions of several Zimbabwean nationals in 2010.Mokotedi previously courted controversy at the National Prosecuting Authority while he headed its integrity management unit. He resigned before facing disciplinary action on multiple charges of misconduct.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
