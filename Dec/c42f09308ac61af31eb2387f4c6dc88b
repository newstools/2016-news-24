Since her appointment in the summer the president's daughter has pledged to turn the company around.Earlier this month Sonangol announced it would not pay dividends to the state this year - a first for the country's main source of foreign currency.Angola's vast oil wealth has not trickled down to the masses and critics accuse both dos Santos and his family of amassing huge wealth by siphoning off state funds.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
