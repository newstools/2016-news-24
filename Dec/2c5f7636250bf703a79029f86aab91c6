Lauren KlaasenCape Town - A recent tweet&nbsp;posted on Parliament's Twitter account in response to an article on City Press about the alleged alarming amounts of public money spent by Secretary to Parliament Gengezi&nbsp;Mgidlana on an overseas trip has created a stir on social media.&nbsp;After a few consecutive tweets by @ParliamentofRSA in defence of the expenditure, including one which called the article "sensational" and "misleading", Twitter piled on the responses to a specific tweet which received more than 150 replies.The tweet consisted of a spelling error and a poorly calculated figure that followers soon picked up on. For Exampe a basic hotel accommodation service which costs R1300 for bed-breakfast in South Africa could cost about R23000 per day in London The error was not overlooked by Twitter users. Here are some of the responses to the tweet:Either the travel agency screwed @ParliamentofRSA in a "royal" way or the typist of this Tweet is highly ignorant &amp; uneducated! #Research @ParliamentofRSA How can you waste R23000 per night?, while we have citizens who sleep without food and proper shelter ? @ParliamentofRSA with that 23000 poor student can acquire a diploma in accounting science at Unisa, stop wasting our taxes @ParliamentofRSA you are gonna get fetched for this....and I am going to enjoy this pic.twitter.com/cKKdwBnEFo @ParliamentofRSA Some spelling mistakes: Exampe should be Example Basic should be High End.&mdash; Monique (@lycotonum) December 18, 2016 @ParliamentofRSA Please refrain from causing parly more embarrassment.
