The incident appears to have played out in Gugulethu, either at or near popular hangout Mzoli's.Manual&nbsp;played the&nbsp;character Gums in the movie, a ringleader of the 28s gang operating in Pollsmoor prison. In the video clip Manual, standing near a car,&nbsp;is surrounded by men who start pushing him against it."He makes a kak movie of the 8s," one of the men can be heard saying.Concern for actor's safetyManual tries in vain to explain that the movie isn't about the gang. He was repeatedly&nbsp;smacked, punched&nbsp;and pushed around.Neither Manual nor Mzoli's responded to repeated requests&nbsp;for comment.According to him, this was not the first time the actor's life had been threatened following the film's screening.This despite that the film had received the approval of a top 28s general, the producer said. "The film [Noem My Skollie] was firstly shown in the Pollsmoor prison [where the film plays out] and one of the top generals of the 28's [gang] didn't have a problem with the film. It's interesting that the leader agrees with the film and not lower-level members of the gang," said Brown. Police could not confirm whether a case of assault had been opened or not.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
