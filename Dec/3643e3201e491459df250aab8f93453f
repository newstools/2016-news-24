Acting on a tip-off, animal inspectors found the animal at a house in Philippi East on Friday.The female seal was likely being kept for the purposes of producing traditional medicines, said spokesperson Belinda Abraham."When we arrived on the scene, she was lying on hot sand and in direct sunlight," said wildlife unit manager Janet van der Vywer.The seal had severe head trauma, causing an eye to bulge. She was also having seizures at the time."We suspect that the head injury was as a result of blunt force trauma administered to immobilise her for transportation," said van der Vywer.The seal was examined at the wildlife unit facility, treated for pain, and monitored throughout the day.She continued to have severe seizures, which the SPCA believed were most likely caused by the head trauma, stress, and inhumane treatment she had experienced."She refused all food offered to her and by the end of the day we had to accept that her suffering was too great and that she would never be able to enjoy the freedom of the ocean again," said Abraham.She was euthanised. A post-mortem was scheduled for later on Monday so her injuries could be understood for prosecution purposes.The SPCA would work with the police, Cape Nature and Marine Coastal Management to ensure that&nbsp;those who had harmed the animal&nbsp;were charged.They could be charged with contravening the Animal Protection Act and the Marine Living Resources Act.Abraham thanked residents for reporting the "heinous act of cruelty". She also thanked the police for&nbsp;their assistance. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
