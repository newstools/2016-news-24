The embarrassing mess-up was later blamed on a secretary.Naturally.In a sign of just how seriously Zimbabwe takes security around the president and top officials, roads around parliament will be closed for two hours this afternoon, an official communique from the clerk of parliament Kennedy Chokuda reads.The possibility of Mugabe standing down has been especially big in Zimbabweans' minds following the defeat of Gambian strongman Yahya Jammeh at the weekend and Angolan president Jose Eduardo dos Santos' surprise announcement that he will not seek re-election in 2017. Dos Santos has been in power one year longer than Mugabe, who assumed power at independence in 1980.Commenting on Jammeh's electoral defeat (and apparent willingness to concede it), one Zimbabwean said on Twitter that it was "a feeling we will always imagine and dream of".Mugabe was supposed to give this speech last week but he was in Cuba for Fidel Castro's funeral.So if he's not announcing his retirement on Tuesday, what will the Zimbabwe president say?Well, judging from previous SONAs, we can nearly guarantee there will be passing mention of (illegal) sanctions, drought and economic empowerment. It will be a speech with gravitas though: it's not normally a platform for fiery political outbursts.Will he talk about bond notes? Now that would be interesting.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
