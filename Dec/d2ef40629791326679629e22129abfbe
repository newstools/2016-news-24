Settlement of 275 personal injury claims had been delayed as the claimants&rsquo; lawyer was still deciding whether to agree to use one set of medical experts, which would help speed the process up.Ndlozi said efforts to seek accountability would however be futile if Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, former police minister Nathi Mthethwa and former mineral resources minister Susan Shabangu were not held accountable for their roles in the shooting. &nbsp;On August 16, 2012, police shot dead 34 striking Lonmin miners, in an attempt to disperse and disarm them and end their industrial action. Ten people, including two police officers and two Lonmin security guards, were killed in the preceding week.Zuma subsequently established a commission of inquiry, chaired by retired judge Ian Farlam, to look into the matter.Farlam found that no senior government officials, including Lonmin non-executive board member Ramaphosa, were responsible for the shootings.It however recommended a probe into police commissioner Riah Phiyega's fitness to hold office. The Claassen Board of Inquiry was set up to do so. The inquiry concluded its hearings on June 3. It announced in November that it would hand its report to Zuma at a date to be determined by him.&nbsp;Zuma suspended Phiyega in October last year.Ndlozi said the trauma the miners and their families had suffered would never be repaired by money.&ldquo;To decide what amount is to be paid to them without having including them in the decision-making processes undermines the tragedy and the trauma suffered by the miners and their families in the hands of the ANC government,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
