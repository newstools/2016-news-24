The mission again expressed regret over the verdict reached by Gabon's top court in September which dismissed Ping's appeal for a recount based on anomalies in Haut-Ogooue, officially confirming Bongo's victory.An initial report by the observers expressing concern about the vote sparked an angry reaction from the Gabonese government, with a spokesman saying the mission was "neither neutral nor impartial".In October, a French newspaper published a report saying the the 73-strong European observer team had been wiretapped by Gabonese intelligence.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
