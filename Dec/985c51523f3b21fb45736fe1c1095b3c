Nicole.JohnTHE family of an elderly Pietermaritzburg couple is looking for information following a hit and run that took place on 9 November between 9.15pm and 9.40pm. The couple were on their way home from a family gathering in Chase Valley when their car was t-boned at the Boshoff and Berg street intersection. According to their son, Steven King, the other driver had jumped the red traffic light and hit the couple s vehicle full on the driver s side. The driver got out and checked his car, but then left without checking on the elderly couple, or exchanging information. My mom turned 73 that day so it wasn t a very happy day for them. The problem is that they now sit without transport. They are both pensioners with limited income. The other car was a dark colour and would have considerable damage to the front of his vehicle, he said. Anyone with information can phone King on 082 920 5799. - Supplied.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
