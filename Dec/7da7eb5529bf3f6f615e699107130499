Social networks mobilise protest because they are easy to use by telephone and charges are relatively low for the population of one of the world's poorest nations. Questioned by AFP, Telecommunications Minister Thomas Luhaka responded by SMS that he was "not informed" of such measures, but one operator said ISPs had been warned they would lose their licences if they failed to comply.During violent riots in January 2015, the authorities ordered a total 48-hour shutdown of the internet, but this completely paralysed the economy, notably because the banks could undertake no transactions."This time the authorities have learned the lesson," one operator said. "There won't be an internet blackout (causing) enormous harm in economic terms." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
