We were in the middle of the hearing when the presiding judge was called by the Judge President (George Chiweshe) and came back later and then granted an order compelling the First Lady to remove her representatives from the properties and to ensure that all workers at the properties who had lost their jobs were immediately reinstated."Grace is not new to controversy. At the height of the land reform, she grabbed a farm in Mazowe, about 30km north of the capital Harare. She later turned into an orphanage. More recently, the First Lady also grabbed another farm, Manzou, located in the same district that ruling Zanu-PF party insiders say she wants to turn into an animal sanctuary, rendering several families, mostly women and children, homeless.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
