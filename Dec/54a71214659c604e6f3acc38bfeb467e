The ICC wanted Bashir to stand trial on charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.The court ruled that failure to prevent him from leaving was unconstitutional. Despite this, the government allowed him to leave from Air Force Base Waterkloof.Government was denied leave to appeal the ruling.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
