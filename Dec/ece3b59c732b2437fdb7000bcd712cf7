"We are aware that people are doing this voluntarily due to their religious beliefs but we would like to urge them to read the user instructions of any products used by their pastors on them." He said people's safety should be prioritised when using chemicals considered to be dangerous to human health. "It must also be investigated whether these prophets and pastors are hiring people to do abnormal things pretending to be the acts of the prophecy or whether people are driven by desperation for survival which makes them seek miracles to change their lives," Gwala added. Another unorthodox pastor from the Mount Zion General Assembly made the news recently when he claimed that spraying Doom &ndash; a household insecticide aerosol brand &ndash; on his congregation would heal them.Other recent cases have involved pastors claiming to have received messages from God calling for congregants to perform acts including biting live snakes and rats, eating their own hair and drinking petrol. This would help them heal or eradicate their woes, the pastors claimed.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
