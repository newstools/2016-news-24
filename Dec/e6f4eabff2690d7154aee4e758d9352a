The IEB still use the national curriculum as a guideline," she said.Rees said she couldn't yet say if the move to IEB was a smart decision."I am a bit hesitant to say the IEB move was a good one, because they [the matrics] did exceptionally well. If they didn&rsquo;t perform well it might have been a different story," she said."We will only know for sure if the matrics start entering universities and we receive those results."According to Rees, the biggest benefit of IEB was that the teachers had rethought their teaching styles."The biggest advantage [of the move] was that everybody sat down and reconsidered how we teach, why we teach what, and how we apply things," she said."I, myself, rewrote and changed several papers to make the adjustment," said Rees, who is a trained art teacher.'IEB is more traditional'She said the IEB system was a much more organised system."When you phone, calls get answered and there is a quick response. But you have to remember that they can deliver this type of service because they only cater to a small portion of matrics in the country."Rees believes that the NSC has its own advantages."There are certain areas where the National Certificate is doing exciting things that relate to our contexts," she said."The art curriculum is, for example, vastly more current and socially aware, where the IEB is more traditional."Rees missed being a part of a larger community with the NSC, but said that the school would work hard not to lose the connection."In the past, we were a part of a broader community, where we worked with other schools in Soweto and not only in a privileged system," she said."We, as a private school, were sharing our knowledge and expertise with those around us. There is something very rewarding working with teachers facing incredible difficulties circumstances in schools." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
