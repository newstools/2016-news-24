"It can't be that each time there is going to be a leadership succession, you have this kind of turbulence that we see," SACP general secretary Blade Nzimande said on Friday. The party held a media briefing on Friday following an augmented central committee meeting held throughout the week. The SACP said it was unacceptable for a 104-year-old liberation movement to not have a clear policy on leadership succession. The party said rather than focusing on the names of those who should be elected as ANC president or in other leadership positions, there should be criteria for effective leadership."It is not our call, it's the ANC's call but the reason why we are commenting on this is because it is a destabilising factor across the alliance," said Nzimande.Concern over 'kingmakers'The ANC is expected to choose new leadership in December 2017, when current president Jacob Zuma steps down. There has been great concern from different quarters of the ANC and its alliance members that the journey towards the 54th elective conference will destroy the movement with competing factions trying to get their preferred candidate to succeed as party leader. He expressed concern over so-called "king makers" who portray themselves as having the ability to put people in power. "You start getting these all-out wars, when people start projecting themselves as kingmakers," he went on to say. Nzimande said there needed to be policies on how leadership or power is transferred.He said the ANC would, otherwise, tear itself apart.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
