The party said he died from torture wounds.The defendants bailed on Tuesday had protested outside court where UDP leader Ousainou Darboe appeared on similar charges after he was arrested in April.Darboe was released on bail along with 18 others on Monday as part of their ongoing appeal against three-year sentences.He told journalists Tuesday that if Barrow's coalition had not won the elections he believed he would not have been released."My imprisonment had already been arranged so there was nothing I could do about it," he said at his home. "If we had not won the elections I would not have been out."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
