Radio communication with the team was very difficult due to the location."Those on the chopper ensured that the hiker was stable."Upon returning to the base to refuel the... helicopter was dispatched to Wupperthal in the Cederberg mountains for a motor vehicle accident involving a truck. One patient was transported to Citrusdal Provincial Hospital.&nbsp; Due to fading daylight the rescue helicopter was unable to return to Wit Els to extricate the patient and rescue team. The rescue team spent the night with the patient on the mountain."At first light on Saturday the hiker, her companion&nbsp;and eight rescuers were hoisted to safety."Technically this was a difficult rescue, team work and was of the utmost importance to ensure everyone is safe," the Air Mercy Service statement said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
