She had finally received a new wheelchair.GroundUp told her story in October, reporting that her mother Zandile had to watch over her as she slept because the paralysed teen could not feel when the rats and mice that were a problem in their shack bit her.During a recent visit, an overjoyed Zandile, who apart from the wheelchair also showed GroungUp food, nappies and clothing donated to her daughter, said she was extremely happy and thankful to the people who had reached out to her daughter."I am so happy and did not expect this overwhelming response. When I got a phone call from the people who wanted to bring me the wheelchair, I didn't think it would actually happen."After that, I also got calls from people who wanted to bring Palesa clothes and food. Now we at least have things for this festive season. I am beyond grateful," said Zandile. The teen's&nbsp;old wheelchair was damaged and almost unusable under the conditions she lives in in the informal settlement of Barcelona with her mother and two younger brothers."We are finished with school now until next year. So, I am looking forward to the holidays and spending more time with my family. And, I want to say thank you for everything," said Palesa.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
