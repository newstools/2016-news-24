Cape Town - Social media users again let rip at a woman who had apparently posted a racist post on a neighbourhood page on Facebook at the weekend. A resident by the name of Vanessa Hartley posted on Sunday that there are "too many Africans flocking to Hout Bay" in Cape Town and also said "they are like stupid animals". Twitter users were naturally incensed: Racism should be criminalized. #VanessaHartley tries a #PennySparrow but there are too many people who share they sentiments, expose them pic.twitter.com/XDOv45N4t0Black South Africans are never shocked at anything racist for they've lived for decades that exact racism spewed by #VanessaHartley et al.&mdash; Prof. AkanyangM (@AkanyangM) December 4, 2016If she can't stand AFRICANS IN THEIR OWN LAND why is she still in SA I'm pretty sure we can all breathe without you darling #VanessaHartley&mdash; MKGB (@Therealmkgb) December 4, 2016If she can't stand AFRICANS IN THEIR OWN LAND why is she still in SA I'm pretty sure we can all breathe without you darling #VanessaHartleyAccording to a screengrab posted on Twitter, Harley apparently posted an apology on a Facebook page called Hout Bay Complete in which she stated that she had left her phone unattended at a bar.So #VanessaHartley thinks we're stupid? She left her phone unattended, at a bar, for a whole 21 minutes? GTFOH pic.twitter.com/OQvmlebk9oHer apology has not brought about any sympathy, as Twitter uses continue to express their distaste for the racist remark.That apology was drier than the kalahari desert, she should be punished #vanessahartleyAccording to Trendinalia ZA, #VanessaHartley is currently still one of the top five trending topics in South Africa.&nbsp; ? #NelsonMandela ? #AskAMan ?

Similar to Hartley's case, the post went viral on social media and eventually led to a hefty fine by the Equality Court. #PennySparrow Jan 2016: "Too many black people on our beaches"#VanessaHartley Dec 2016: "Too many Africans on our beaches" What a year...People like #VanessaHartley are the reason why racism still prevails. It's actually quite sad to have people that still think in that mannerIt's never gonna end if people post such hateful things in Facebook and get only a slap on a wrist. #VanessaHartley #RacismMustFall&mdash; ThembileThembs Shazi (@BlackFireFly892) December 5, 2016It's never gonna end if people post such hateful things in Facebook and get only a slap on a wrist. #VanessaHartley #RacismMustFall&mdash; ThembileThembs Shazi (@BlackFireFly892) December 5, 201624.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
