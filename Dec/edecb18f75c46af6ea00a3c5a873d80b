"In the case of Sfiso, his children will be... taken care of even after his passing because if we play his music, the family gets royalties," Motsoeneng said at Ncwane's funeral on Saturday in Durban. He said that South Africans were right to be proud of Ncwane's work. "We are very proud of Ncwane and what he achieved during his time here on earth as an artist. He had his own company and that shows growth. I pray that other artists follow suit."He said that he did not want artists to have to travel to Johannesburg to make music. "We are working hard to ensure that the SABC has quality studios in KZN so that it can be able to record artists from the province. We want to see them prosper here. As the SABC we have started scouting and nurturing talent."Motsoeneng&nbsp;said the SABC would always push for 90% local music and urged artists to work together and not put each other down. "Jealousy must be a thing of the past."At least 3&nbsp;000 people made their way to Moses Mabhida stadium for Ncwane's funeral. Dignitaries from the gospel industry, government and the religious sector also converged on the event. There was also a heavy security presence in preparation for a large crowd. Rain has pelted down steadily, but Ncwane fans have still streamed in. Ncwane died of kidney failure on Monday at a hospital in Fourways, Johannesburg.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
