These increases are in line with the recommendations made by the state in September this year,&rdquo; the statement reads.In September, Minister of Higher Education and Training Blade Nzimande announced that university fees may not exceed an 8% increase in response to mass student protests against fees.Nzimande also promised that households earning less than R600 000 per annum would not be exposed to university fee increases.State supportREAD: Mantashe: We must not spend all the money on 'Victorian universities'Wits said that it was in a financially constrained position that forced the institution to increase its fees.&ldquo;The University has no choice but to increase fees if it is to remain financially sustainable as academics and professional and administrative staff need to be remunerated, books and journals need to be purchased (many in foreign currency), utilities need to be paid and infrastructure needs to be maintained.&ldquo;In addition, the University will accommodate the costs of insourcing and the new ICT renewal project from 2017,&rdquo; the Wits statement said.Wits said that state support amounted to R146m in terms of supporting a 0% increase.&ldquo;However, we have been recently informed that the 2016 fee increase will now be rolled into the subsidy, the net effect of which is that our subsidy increase for 2017 will be only 2.5%. This equates to a net decline in income of approximately R54m for 2017 from the state.&rdquo;READ: R17bn over 3 years needed to fund higher education - GordhanThe National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) recently announced that students it supported will no longer have to pay registration fees at universities and colleges at the beginning of 2017.However, Higher Education deputy minister Mduduzi Manana warned that NSFAS not enough students were applying for funding from the institution.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite discouraging. Why would students not apply when the window is open for them?&rdquo; he told Parliament&rsquo;s higher education committee.Wits said that it currently assists 22 000 out of 37 000 students with financial aid, but it faced a deficit of R56.5m despite the 8% fee increase. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
