The official said Wednesday that the Justice Ministry committee tasked with monitoring the businesses of the Islamist group has issued the order against Mustafa Saqr and his company Business News, which also publishes the economic daily al-Borsa. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorised to speak to the press. The company, in a statement, said it has no political or religious affiliation and that President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi chose the same dailies to run his pieces on economic policies last year. Saqr said that he will defend his company's reputation. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
