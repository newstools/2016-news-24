Some had to be admitted to hospital.The City of Cape Town sent out a health warning last Friday, but by then residents were furious, Netwerk24 reported."They should have warned us when the pipe burst last Monday.

This could have been avoided if we were informed of the problem on Monday," Heidenrich said.The city council released a statement on Monday informing residents that the water in St Michaels was safe for consumption.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
