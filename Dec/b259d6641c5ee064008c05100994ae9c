"AfriForum accuses Genl Maj Prince Mokotedi of attempting to conceal his own role and those of other supporters of President Jacob Zuma in the capturing of the criminal justice system by telling lies."According to Kriel, Mokotedi filed the affidavit because he is concerned about a report AfriForum published in which the organisation allegedly exposes Mokotedi as one of the role players in the "illegal capture of the criminal justice system by Zuma supporters".&nbsp;Kriel also said in the statement that AfriForum will not be distracted by&nbsp;Mokotedi's "dirty tricks", and that they will continue to fight corruption and expose those who have undue influence over the criminal justice system. &nbsp;Robert McBride told News24 on Tuesday that Mokotedi's claims are attempts to get rid of him and that he was not sure if any Democratic Alliance and AfriForum members had attended the meeting.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
