Nosipho.MkhizeThe SA Post Office advises motorists to check their car licence prior to going on holiday. Many motorists may not be aware that their car licence has expired or will expire whilst on holiday and may be given a traffic fine for the infringement. There are currently 31 post office branches in KZN where vehicle owners can renew their vehicle licence. By law vehicle licence renewals must be done in the province the vehicle is registered in and cannot be done while on holiday in another province.Geert Bataille, head of the SA Post Office s Retail division, says motorists must remember to take proof of residence and an identity document when renewing a car licence - this is a legal requirement. Should motorists not have received a renewal notice, the renewal form (ALV) may be downloaded from www.enatis.comDuring the 2015/2016 financial year, more than 3,7 million motor vehicle licences were renewed at SA Post Office branches, evidence of the success of this service.
