"Fulfilling political promises when you take over the reins of power and you have to clean up a lot of mess, it's not easy," said the Nobel prize-winning author. The ex-military ruler has seen his approval ratings decline in recent months from 80% last year to 41% this September, according to analysis firm BMI Research.Soyinka said while Buhari was the better choice of the two candidates in last year's vote where he squared off against ex-president Goodluck Jonathan, it was high time the country weaned itself off leaders with military backgrounds."I was not particularly enamoured of the idea of a military person continuing - for heaven's sake, it's been too long," he said."I feel very passionate that it's about time that we eliminated the last vestiges of military control, of military representation. It's as if there are no brains outside the military."Nigeria abandoned military rule in 1999 in favour of multi-party democracy following six military coups after independence from Britain in 1960.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
