Pupils in the 20% range would be compelled to take mathematical literacy.Quality of teachers a concernWestern Cape Education MEC Debbie Sch&auml;fer on Friday criticised the interim measure.&nbsp;"This is simply putting a band aid on a patient in ICU and will result in the death of our economy if we do not do something urgently to fix it," she said in a statement.&nbsp;"How can a learner who achieves 20% be expected to pass maths the following year or two?"Questions were raised around the department's plan for improving the maths marks of those who were condoned."If there is no drastic action taken, we will be sitting in the same position next year," said Sch&auml;fer. "The circular does not address the real problem, and that is that we simply do not have sufficient good maths teachers in South Africa."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
