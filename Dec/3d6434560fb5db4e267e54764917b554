That is the reason all these people [are] making noise, they know in those meetings I defeat them," Motsoeneng said to loud applause.The Western Cape High Court ruled on December 12 that Motsoeneng may not hold any position within the SABC.Motsoeneng, however, told the audience that he still considers himself an SABC employee."I am still an SABC employee. I don't have a title, but I am [an] employee of the SABC. I don't need a title to change the lives of people, I need myself," Motsoeneng said.Motsoeneng for ministerThe former SABC COO also expressed frustration with board members coming out against him."All of them used their vote to say that they agree with Hlaudi, today they are turning back to say, 'Joh, it was Hlaudi who took that decision'. Which means I am the most powerful person in South Africa.""If those decisions [have] assisted SABC to [empower] black people, I am very proud," Motsoeneng said.Speaking to News24 on Wednesday, ANCYL KwaZulu-Natal regional secretary Thinta Cibane said the league would place pressure on government for Motsoeneng be appointed as a minister."He [Motsoeneng] will bring transformation to departments," Cibane said.According to Cibane, the ANCYL in KwaZulu-Natal is concerned about ANC members being part of the SABC parliamentary inquiry."It is ridiculous that these so-called ANC members agree publicly and privately with the DA and EFF," Cibane said."This [the parliamentary inquiry] is nothing more than antics leading up to the elective conference of 2017."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
