However, a person can be fined an amount of R750 according to the current municipal policy," safety and security mayoral committee member councillor John Best said.NMBM has also denied that those driving without their drivers' licences would be taken into custody and be liable for a fine of R1 000.According to Best, a person driving without a licence can only be arrested once a warrant of arrest has been issued. "However, motorists are warned to refrain from doing illegal acts. If caught, the law will take its course with the relevant fines issued to offenders," Best said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
