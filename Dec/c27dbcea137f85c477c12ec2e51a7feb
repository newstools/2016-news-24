Samuel and his mom were transported to Somerset Hospital.&ldquo;Yet again, our staff members have done the City proud,&rdquo; Smith said. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re told the mom was only six months pregnant, so the actions of Messrs Freeman and Daniels are to be commended. If they hadn&rsquo;t responded in the way they did, the situation might have turned out differently." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
