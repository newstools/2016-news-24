However she said Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng should be tasked with choosing a judge to head up the commission.Premature&ldquo;It&rsquo;s insufficient to give notice of a review,&rdquo; said Selfe.The Nkandla judgment obliged Zuma to carry out remedial action unless it&rsquo;s set aside, and that was not done in this matter, Selfe said.The DA chairperson said the party would approach the Constitutional Court because the matter fell under its exclusive jurisdiction.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about the powers of the public protector and those of the president,&rdquo; he told News24.Constitutional law expert Professor Marinus Weichers said he believed the DA raised a valid point in saying the public protector&rsquo;s remedial action is binding, but felt the party&rsquo;s bid was premature.&ldquo;The Constitutional Court is generally hesitant if lower courts have not decided on it yet,&rdquo; said Weichers.He said he did not believe the DA's bid would succeed.&ldquo;Zuma is at the lower courts, the ConCourt might just say let&rsquo;s wait and see how that goes.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
