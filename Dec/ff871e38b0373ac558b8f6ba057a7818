Only this time, he has traded in his sleigh for a donkey and carriage.&nbsp; Donning a faux white beard and a worn out red jumper, Ferose Hartley exudes the kind of excitement that people expect from Santa himself.&ldquo;It makes me happy to see that I can play a role that impacts the children. Being Santa gives me butterflies all over my body and brings so much joy,&rdquo; Hartley told News24. The &ldquo;Santa kom Eldos toe&rdquo; [Santa comes to Eldos] initiative, established by NPO Dedicated Ladies, seeks to bring hope to the youth of the Eldorado Park community, an area overshadowed by a high crime and unemployment rate.&nbsp; While many children ask Santa for a doll or bicycle, Hartley said the most heartfelt request he has received from a child was to bring back his father and their home.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Christmas spirit is gone in Eldos. It would be lovely if we could introduce the children to a real Santa,&rdquo; a member of the organisation, Wendy Starkey said. Starkey said they wanted to give children a feel of the Christmas celebrations and not just the visuals they see on television.&nbsp; The non profit organisation established the project in 2012.&nbsp; In 2015 they handed out 6000 party packs.&nbsp; Starkey described the event on the December 23 as emotional and humbling.&nbsp; Charlene van Buuren who plays Mrs Santa Claus said the event was going to rock Eldorado Park. &ldquo;This year we are trying to make it a little bigger and better and give out more party packs. We also want the parents to take more photos of Santa,&rdquo; Van Buuren said.&nbsp;Chairperson of the organisation, Joane Starkey said the aim for this year is to hand out 10 000 party packs.&nbsp; In previous years the project was funded by the ladies from the organisation.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are praying and hoping that we will have more sponsors, otherwise we will use what we have,&rdquo; Joane said.&nbsp; The organisation consists of five ladies and two men.&nbsp; Although the ladies fight a lot, they try to put their differences aside and make it work.&nbsp; &ldquo;As women there will always be a lot of cat fights, but we always talk it out. We try and keep the peace together for the sake of the children.&rdquo; Joane said having Santa in Eldorado Park was one of the most precious things.&nbsp; &ldquo;We know what it&rsquo;s like not to have, there were times when we didn&rsquo;t even have Christmas clothes. So why not make the difference in lives,&rdquo; she said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
