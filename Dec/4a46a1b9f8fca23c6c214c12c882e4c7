We are extremely concerned about the children trapped in these areas," he added.Boko Haram attacked a military-escorted humanitarian convoy in July about 70km from Maiduguri, the birthplace of the insurgency, wounding a Unicef worker, two other aid workers and two soldiers.Suicide bombings&nbsp;A rocket-propelled grenade slammed into the windshield of a bullet-proof vehicle, one that Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has accused the agency of buying instead of spending money on people in need. UNICEF said the vehicle was a donation.Lake spoke just days after Buhari accused the UN and private international aid agencies of exaggerating the crisis to seek donations. Buhari declared that Boko Haram was "technically defeated" a year ago and appears fixed on maintaining that fiction.While soldiers from a multinational force of Nigeria and neighboring countries have pushed the extremists out of towns and many villages they occupied, attacks on military outposts and suicide bombings of soft targets continue.The Associated Press has reported since September that children already are dying of starvation in Maiduguri, the biggest city in Nigeria's northeast that is easily accessible. Doctors Without Borders said in November that thousands of kids already have died, including 10% to 25% of children admitted to its 110-bed Maiduguri emergency treatment center.Nigeria's Senate is investigating allegations that government agencies are diverting food aid that could help prevent those deaths.Buhari was elected in March 2015 on a platform that pledged to finish off Boko Haram and halt endemic corruption.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
