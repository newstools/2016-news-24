It's absolutely sad."In response to ANC MP Juli Kilian, he said company secretary Theresa Geldenhuys had failed in her duties to keep the board in check when its meetings were not quorate."It is the role of the company secretary to honestly advice the board if they don't quorate. If you don't, you fail in your duties."Political interferenceREAD: Motsoeneng 'squatting' at SABC - former board memberHe said if Geldenhuys could not advise the board that founding legislation was higher than any of the other Acts, including the Company's Act, then that was a failure.He also said the SABC board's wheels started coming off after three members - Ronnie Lubisi, the late Hope Zinde, and Rachel Kalidass - were removed in July 2014 for protesting the decision to appoint Hlaudi Motsoeneng as permanent chief operating officer.Responding to Democratic Alliance MP Phumzile van Damme, Tseisi said he did not know what Communications Minister Faith Muthambi's role was in her interactions with the board.He also said political interference was one of the main causes of instability in news organisations and that he had spent much of his role investigating that prior to being suspended in May 2014.He returned briefly in September 2016, but then left permanently in October.The committee also interviewed former board member Krish Naidoo and former acting CEO Phil Molefe on Friday.On Monday, the ad hoc committee will interview former SABC human resources chief Jabulani Mabaso, former technology head Sipho Masinga, former labour relations general manager Madiwe Nkosi, and four journalists representing the "SABC 8". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
