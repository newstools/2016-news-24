In return, the joint venture obtained uranium concessions. In Chad, Mebiame's bribes of cash payments and luxury travel helped win an asset the government had stripped from a French company. Leon Mebiame, Samuel's father, was primer minister of Gabon from 1975 to 1990.As part of September's settlement, an Och-Ziff Africa subsidiary pleaded guilty to a count of bribery in DRC and is due to be sentenced in March. Two of the firm's founders, Daniel Och and Joel Frank, agreed to settle civil charges brought by the SEC without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations.In 1977, the United States criminalized the paying of bribes to foreign officials to win business and other developed nations have followed suit but have not punished foreign bribery at comparable rates.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
