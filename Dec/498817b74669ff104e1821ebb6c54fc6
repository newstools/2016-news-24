Here are five of the best Hlaudisms from his address:&nbsp;&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I am a born intellectual."&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Too much education is dangerous. Don&rsquo;t overdose on education. I talk to professors and I like them. I ask them why they are always quoting people and telling us about the world, but why can&rsquo;t you come with solutions. Until you come with solutions, I will not recognise you."&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I go to interviews for fun, not because I want a job. I tell the panel that their questions are not relevant, so I tell them that I can assist them and tell them what questions to ask. And then I get the job."&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You know why we are not moving with speed in South Africa, because we have copied the West. We are in Africa; we should have our own standard. When you do research, it takes three years, and two years to implement them. I don&rsquo;t believe in research. It is not how I operate&hellip; if I see a problem, I solve it now.&rdquo;&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;"There is a difference between a certificated person and an educated person, but I won&rsquo;t go there."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
