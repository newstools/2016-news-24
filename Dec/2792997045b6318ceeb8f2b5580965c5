Dhlomo said on December 14, two healthcare workers were allegedly assaulted and government property was damaged during an incident when a group of rowdy people accompanied a patient to KwaDukuza Clinic. A fight ensued between members of the group and the staff. The suspects then allegedly assaulted the staff. &nbsp;Gate destroyedDhlomo said the suspects were believed to be part of a group of people who had attended a Christmas year-end function where alcohol was allegedly consumed. Dhlomo said the clinic&rsquo;s security gate was removed and destroyed. A security guard who was walking past the clinic alerted the police to the incident. He said the three suspects appeared to have been the leaders of the attack. &ldquo;Even during the days that we were fighting apartheid, nurses and ambulances were never attacked instead they would be given safe passage and protected to attend to those shot by the enemy.&rdquo;He condemned the attack on health workers and government property. &ldquo;Actually in other states, an attack on official and government building is regarded as an act of sabotage.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
