He questioned the authority of then Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's recommendation which calls for the establishment of a judicial commission to investigate allegations detailed in her State of Capture report. Madonsela was investigating allegations of an improper relationship between Zuma and the powerful and politically-connected Gupta family whom the president has referred to as his friends. Madonsela said in the report she didn't have the resources to finish the investigation and recommended a judicial inquiry. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
