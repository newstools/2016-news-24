When I saw the one guy&rsquo;s revolver, I knew I had to be careful. Everything happened so fast that I can&rsquo;t say if I was scared of dying or just got a terrible fright,&rdquo; he told&nbsp;Netwerk24. Johnson and his assistant, Uric Carolus, had stopped and got out of their bakkie in Montmedy Road, &nbsp;Lorraine, around 02:00 to put copies of Die Burger in their plastic bags before delivering them.&nbsp;This was when four robbers appeared from bushes. They were apparently from the Piet-se-Bos informal settlement.&ldquo;They told us to stand still and searched us. They took some of the papers and magazines, my money, bank card and licence. They took my cellphone as well,&rdquo; said Johnson.&nbsp;&ldquo;They took everything they wanted before disappearing into the bushes again.&rdquo;Johnson had been delivering papers and magazines for two months.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s weird. We usually use my car, because it&rsquo;s easier. The one night I use the bakkie, this happens. Fortunately no one was injured. It could have been so different.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
