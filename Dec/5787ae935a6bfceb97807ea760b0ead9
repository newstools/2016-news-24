Vusi.Mthalane A MAN who pays for tuition for an Esayidi TVET College student says a serious matter he reported to the institution has not received the attention it should.Vincent Bulala said he received a complaint from the student that a mathematics and engineering lecturer at Esayidi Oslo Beach campus, whose name is known to the Fever, tells students to study the book on their own and then sits on the phone until the period is over. Bulala said he investigated this and it was backed up by other students. He says he then brought the matter to the principal s attention, but struggled to get an undertaking that the matter will be urgently looked into. After a number of times trying to set a meeting with the principal and being told he was not available, I was told a meeting that will include everyone involved in this matter can only sit in January, said Bulala. This concerned him as he says some of the complaining students might not return next year. The Fever tried to get Esayidi s side of the story, but emails sent were not replied to and messages not responded to. The Fever also saw the trail of emails sent by Bulala to Esayidi requesting a meeting to discuss the matter.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
