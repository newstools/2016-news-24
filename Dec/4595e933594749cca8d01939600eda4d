She didn't know what to do with them, but her neighbours in Mbuba said "plant them" and showed her how. The crop was large as were the sweet potatoes - the biggest weighing in at three kilograms.Last week Winnie arrived at the Gazette office with huge bunches of healthy looking green turnip leaves, pumpkin tops, spinach and mustard, which she was selling. Obviously the green-finger gene provides the magic touch as the area in which she lives only gets water on a Friday and she also does not use compost.To contact Winnie phone 076 776 3444.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
