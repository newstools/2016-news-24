"In fact our legal team went even further that we had strong legal grounds to continue."We are absolutely in our rights to have proceeded."Addressing SABC executive Hlaudi Mostoeneng's allegations that the committee is politically biased, Smith said: "We are politicians, this is a political arena and every member here belongs to a political party."We have attempted to be fair and neutral, and from my party X or your party Y, it does not automatically translate that there is a political agenda. Our agenda is accountability."IFP MP Narend Singh said the SABC's apparent defiance would not stop the ad hoc committee from dealing objectively with facts.ANC MP Makhosi Khoza said it was a "sad day" when the country's highest legislative body was being questioned."Questioning the legitimacy of this committee is questioning the institution itself," she said.DA MP Phumzile van Damme said she was very proud of the committee after it stood its ground against "one man" who was trying to delay accountability.'Braille issue a delaying tactic'EFF MP Fana Mokoena told Maguvhe he should not allow himself to be used by people who have no interest in the SABC at heart.Smith also said Maguvhe's allegations that his rights as a "blind person" were being violated should be rejected with the contempt they deserve."We deliberately today asked the Auditor General, the Public Protector and the portfolio committee: have you ever been asked to provide documents [to the professor] in Braille? They never have."So this issue about not respecting the professor because he is [partially-sighted] and he needed Braille really is a delaying tactic and we must call it what it is."Smith repeated that the SABC's own secretary Theresa Geldenhuys indicated on November 18 that they would transcribe the necessary documents into Braille for Maguvhe.He also said it would be the last time they would respond through the media.Maguvhe earlier told the media that he had felt bullied, belittled and disrespected by the ad hoc committee.The inquiry will recommence at 09:30 on Thursday. On the list of witnesses are former board members Vuyo Mavuso, Lulama Mokhobo and Ronny Lubisi, and Maguvhe himself. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
