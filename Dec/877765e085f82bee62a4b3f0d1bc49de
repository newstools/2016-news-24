parolee was beaten to death, allegedly by prison warders, when he tried to
break into the Virginia prison, the correctional services department said on
Friday. The night duty patrol
at the Virginia Correctional Centre noticed an intruder trying to break into the residential
quarters on Thursday, the department said in a statement. They tried to
apprehend him, but he ran away. Shots were fired, and he was caught. Officials allegedly assaulted
him and he died in hospital. The man was not an inmate at the prison and had
been released on parole on September 21. He had no reason to be there. It emerged later that
the man had other parole violations. His previous convictions included housebreaking.
His name was not released. Correctional services
commissione Zach Modise said a high-level investigation would be conducted and action
would be taken against any warders found guilty of involvement in the man’s
death. “We want to convey our
condolences to the family and relatives of the deceased. We welcome the swift
action taken by the police in this matter. I am personally disappointed and
shocked about this extreme criminality and thuggery. “Those found guilty of
this brutal act must face the full might of the law. We will not tolerate any
type of unlawful behaviour by officials who are supposed to uphold the law.” Modise visited the
prison on Friday to obtain first-hand information about the circumstances of
the parolee’s death.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
