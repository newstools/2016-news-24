Our Law Enforcement Officers are currently checking on recycling systems, and where it is found to be lacking will be instructing the business to adhere to this within a month.&ldquo;Our Law Enforcement officers will be out in force to ensure that nobody breeches these new water restrictions,&rdquo; said Bouw-Spies.She said last week, Knysna&rsquo;s daily target of 8ml a day was not met as residents used 16.3Ml a day.&nbsp;Sedgefield&rsquo;s target daily water consumption is 1.9Ml a day and its residents used 2.9Ml a day during the same period.&nbsp;&ldquo;We are asking all residents and visitors to be our eyes and ears on the ground and report water abuse.
