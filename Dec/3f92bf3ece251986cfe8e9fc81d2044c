It wants elections next year - along with a pledge that Kabila will not stand.Kabila, 45, who has ruled since 2001, is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term but under a controversial recent constitutional court order, he may stay on until a successor is chosen.In a YouTube video, Tshisekedi launched "a solemn appeal to the Congolese people to no longer recognise the authority of Mr. Joseph Kabila, to the international community to no longer deal with Joseph Kabila in the name of the Democratic Republic of Congo".He urged people "to peacefully resist the coup d'etat".The message was not available in DRC where authorities have since Sunday imposed strict controls on social media networks.Tshisekedi said he hoped to continue the talks launched by the Catholic Church last week.In Rome, Pope Francis appealed to the people of DRC to be "artisans of peace" at his weekly audience."May those who are in positions of political responsibility listen to the voice of their conscience, learn to see the cruel sufferings of their fellow citizens and have at heart the common good."DR Congo has never witnessed a democratic transfer of power following polls since independence from Belgium in 1960.The president has been in office since his father Laurent Kabila's assassination in 2001. He was elected in 2006, and again in 2011.Some two decades ago, the country collapsed into the deadliest conflict in modern African history. Its two wars in the late 1990s and early 2000s dragged in at least six African armies and left more than three million dead.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
