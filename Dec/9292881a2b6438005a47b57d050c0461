A wildlife expert, Nick Lynch, who has reportedly been monitoring the transaction since 2014, described as "a mad act of cruelty" the separation of the young elephants from their herds.Zimbabwean wildlife officials have defended the move, saying it "would ease pressure on the 'overburdened' parks".&nbsp;This comes a few days after a Harare judge ordered Grace to return three properties that she seized from a Lebanese businessman in a botched $1.35m diamond ring deal.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
