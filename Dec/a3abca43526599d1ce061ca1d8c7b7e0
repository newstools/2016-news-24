Bridget.Siebert1THE former school counsellor who so far faces 10 counts of rape and sexual abuse of primary school boys will be indicted to stand trial in the high court next year.This emerged when the counsellor made a brief appearance before a magistrate last week via CCTV, screened from the New Prison in Pietermaritzburg.Magistrate M. Boikhutso was told that advocate Frank van Heerden from the office of the KZN director of public prosecutions, who was in court, is preparing the indictment to be served on the counsellor at his next court appearance on January 30. This is by agreement between the defence and state. The court was also told one or more charges may still be added to the charge sheet.The counsellor s defence team still plans to lodge an appeal in the high court against last month s decision by the magistrate to again refuse him bail. However, this can only be done once the defence obtains a copy of the transcript of the bail proceedings. For the time being it appears that the counsellor will spend the festive season behind bars.He has so far failed in three attempts to be granted bail, and has been in custody since his arrest in June this year. He initially faced two charges of rape and two of sexual assault, but since then the number of charges has increased as more pupils came forward alleging they were molested.The alleged victims are boys between the ages of five and 11 years old who were pupils at the school where the accused worked.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
