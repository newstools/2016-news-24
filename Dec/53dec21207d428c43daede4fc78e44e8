"The battle to come is to conquer the National Assembly."No fewer than 1 337 candidates are standing in the single-round poll, in which winner takes all in each constituency.This electoral system has forced Ouattara's own Rally of Republicans (RDR) party to find common ground with other parties in the RHDP coalition, particularly its main allies of the Ivory Coast Democratic Party.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
