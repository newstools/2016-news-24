In September, Minister of Higher Education and Training Blade Nzimande announced that university fees may not exceed an 8% increase in response to mass student protests against fees. Nzimande also promised that households with an income of less than R600 000 per annum would not be affected by the fee increases. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
