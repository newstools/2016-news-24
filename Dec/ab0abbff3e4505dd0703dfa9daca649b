Inter-African trade has barely increased over the past decade despite overall growth during that period, Sellal said at the event attended by some 2 000 entrepreneurs.One main obstacle is that "Africa does not consume what it produces and consumes what it does not produce", Sellal said.Following the drop in world crude oil prices, Algeria is seeking to diversify its economy and has encouraged firms to do business with the rest of the continent.Exports to sub-Saharan Africa totalled just 0.25% of Algeria's exports over the first nine months of the year, according to official figures.In comparison, Morocco has become the second largest African investor in the continent after South Africa, with more than 60% of its foreign investments worldwide going to Africa, mainly sub-Saharan Africa, according to Morocco's OCP Policy Centre.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
