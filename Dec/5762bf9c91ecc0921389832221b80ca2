We have just celebrated Reconciliation Day, and now more than ever, we should be dedicated to building a non-racist country."At the weekend Sasonof posted: "Eh eh Wena...must have smelt like the inside of Zuma's asshole," with the apparent reference to President Jacob Zuma.His comments raised the ire of other Facebook users who accused Sasonof of being a racist.In response to those condemning his comments, he wrote: "So fuck you and your bf. Go suck on Zuma's dirty, tyrant asshole if you love it so much."Sasonof also lashed out at one of his detractors directly, calling him a monkey."Mohammed Jameel Abdulla you're a fuckin little idiot!
