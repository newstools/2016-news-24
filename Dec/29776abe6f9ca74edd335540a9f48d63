Foreign nationals buy goods in our country, create businesses and stimulate economic growth," he said. &nbsp;Taverna-Turisan added that Mashaba was stating that it did not matter whether "you are from SA or any other country, a criminal is a criminal, and they must be dealt with"."We cannot accept lawlessness in our city and any criminal, whether a South African national or a foreign national, must be apprehended. To say that we must keep quiet about illegal immigrants is to say we must ignore the rule of law and that is simply unacceptable," he said. &nbsp;Revitalise inner cityHe said Mashaba was discussing his plans to revitalise the inner city of Johannesburg and take it back from criminal elements. &nbsp;"It is essential that national government cleans up its act and ensures that there is quick and efficient processing of asylum seekers and refugees. This would protect those who wish to legitimately enter our country from criminal elements, including slum lords and drug traffickers, who abuse their desperation and are able to evade the law."He said Mashaba would welcome a meeting with someone from national government who dealt with the immigration law.At an unrelated event on Tuesday in Westbury, News24 tried to ask Mashaba about the immigration matter but members of his office would not allow the reporter to question him directly. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
