A third accused in the case, Jerome Moses, who allegedly helped to sell her cellphone, is also out on bail.The three accused, along with the fourth, Howard Oliver, who has denied raping and murdering the teen, are all expected back in the dock on January 18, when Oliver is expected to hear whether or not he will be released on bail.When Bl&ouml;chliger's body was found she was naked and on her knees, with her neck twisted in an unnatural position.According to police, a bra and T-shirt had been used to strangle her and one of her shoelaces had been tied around her neck. She was bleeding from the face and genitals. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
