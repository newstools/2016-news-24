In the secretariat report, the union said the August elections proved that the ANC, Cosatu, SACP government had signed its "death warrant".&nbsp; "The ANC, Cosatu, SACP can blame all sorts of issues: factionalism, corruption, the electoral system and even voodoo, but the stark truth is [they] have lost their way and are no longer revolutionary formations," Numsa has said. This confirmed that the working class needed a party committed both in theory and practice to socialism. "Nothing less, nothing more," the report says.Political vacuumThe union has been working to create the party and&nbsp;"they had to create a national structure with offices and all necessary facilities to begin the work of building the party across the country".The report bemoaned the formation of coalition governments in South Africa after the August local elections, questioning whether it would make any difference to the ordinary person.&nbsp; The congress needed to resolve how the union would resource the party, how industrial units would be built and how the international work of the party must be shaped, the report says. The ANC's "degeneration" has created a political vacuum, Numsa said, which made it more urgent than ever before to move more swiftly and more visibly. "To build a genuine revolutionary socialist political party, rooted in the working class, committed to our Marxist programme and be [a]democratically controlled, mass-based workers party, with a programme &nbsp;based on Marxism&ndash;Leninism&nbsp;and abolition of capitalism."&nbsp;Chirwa on Monday called for Numsa members to protect the organisation at all times, otherwise "their enemies would eat them up like a corrosive, like a cancer, slowly and slowly".'You cannot build a federation from the top' The secretariat report also outlines the creation of a new federation which was recently announced by former Cosatu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi.Concerns were raised that while there was a lot happening nationally in the formation of the federation there was little happening locally and regionally. "You cannot build a federation from the top," Numsa said.&nbsp; Chirwa said it was time to form a genuine and militant federation.Numsa was booted out of Cosatu after it decided that it would not support the ANC in the 2014 general elections.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
