We should criminalise racism with a minimum jail sentence of 10 years.&rdquo;There have been several incidences of alleged racism the past month. On December 3, News24 reported that Vanessa Hartley allegedly posted on Facebook that Africans are &ldquo;like stupid animals&rdquo;. On December 12, at a Cape Town eatery, Clark&rsquo;s, coloured clientele were allegedly asked to leave after an apparent racist spat with a white woman. On Sunday, Sandton resident Ben Sasonof commented on a picture of a crowded Durban beach saying it &ldquo;must have smelt like the inside of Zuma's asshole&rdquo;.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
