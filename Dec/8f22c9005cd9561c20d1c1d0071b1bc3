We shall not let them down," a statement by the NSPCA reads."The judgment recognised that the NSPCA is best placed to conduct such private prosecutions, and to give effect to enforcing the offences set out in the Animal Protection Act."The NSPCA was founded in 1955 and undertakes 90% of all animal welfare investigations and prosecutions in South Africa, according to their website. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
