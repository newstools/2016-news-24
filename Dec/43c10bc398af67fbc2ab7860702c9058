The turnout was 59%.Those figures reflect the correction issued Monday by election authorities, showing a slimmer-than-thought victory for Barrow, of just over 19 000 votes.Barrow on Saturday called on Jammeh to drop his challenge, while the UN, US and other foreign authorities lambasted Jammeh and urged Gambians to keep the peace. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
