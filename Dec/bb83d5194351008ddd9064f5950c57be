WATCHPretoria - In Captain Steve Strumpher&rsquo;s cupboard are about 130 specially made shirts to express his support for the All Blacks.&nbsp; Strumpher, 55, is a nurse at the SANDF's 1 Military Hospital in Pretoria.&nbsp;He told&nbsp;Netwerk24&nbsp;he will support the All Blacks until the day he diesEach of the shirts has his name and the team who faced the All Blacks in each specific match.There is also a shirt showing his disgust at the Springboks. &nbsp;&nbsp;On the most recent shirt he&rsquo;s had made, there is the Springbok emblem covered with a black cross. Under this are the words "R.I.P. Springbokke". &nbsp;"Every shirt is special. I don&rsquo;t wear them when I&rsquo;m working in the garden or eating a Russian and chips. And when they have to be washed, I wash them with care. I also only wear the shirts after the match against the All Blacks, so that I don&rsquo;t put the hex on them."&nbsp;Even his bathroom is full of All Black memorabilia."I only dry myself with All Black towels. If I don&rsquo;t have an All Black towel, I&rsquo;d rather not bath."Strumpher gave several reasons why he&rsquo;s peeved with the Boks. The biggest one is politics. "I see the new minister of sport is Jacob Zuma and one of the Guptas the coach. The assistant coach is Des van Rooyen and Julius Malema can be the team doctor."His advice to the Springboks: "Perhaps they&rsquo;ll play better if they are sprayed with Doom."His favourite All Black players?&nbsp;"There are so many of them! Too many to single out. Richie McCaw was an excellent leader. And then there is also the late Jonah Lomu." &nbsp; Strumpher isn&rsquo;t just a supporter of the New Zealand rugby side, but the country as well."My will states that when I die, my children have to phone the New Zealand Embassy in Pretoria. They have to dress me in New Zealand garb and have me cremated just like that. The New Zealand anthem has to play during the cremation. Then they have to either leave my ashes at the embassy or take them to&nbsp;New Zealand." Captain Steve Strumpher with one of his many All Blacks T-shirts.
