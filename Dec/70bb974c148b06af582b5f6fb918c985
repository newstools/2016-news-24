	     Another train was set alight, in the early hours of this morning. In what Regional Metrorail Manager for the Western Cape, Richard Walker, is calling "a siege", another four carriages were destroyed by fire in Kraaifontein staging yard shortly after midnight. Watch. WATCH Cape Town - A train was partially destroyed in a fire on Thursday night at Thornton station, Metrorail has confirmed. Regional spokesperson Riana Scott said four carriages were gutted in the blaze, which started about 21:15. No one was injured and the matter was being investigated. The incident comes days after the rail transport provider was crippled by vandalism which wreaked havoc on the service. Operations were disabled on Sunday after cable thieves hit one of the company's communications nerve centres on Saturday, rendering controllers unable to see where the trains were on the lines. On Monday, a limited service was running as repair work continued. By Tuesday, the train shuttle system was introduced. It bypassed the most severely affected stations, such as Salt River, and moved from one station to another, with commuters changing trains to get to their destinations. By Wednesday, two of Cape Town's three main train lines were back up and running after around- the-clock repair work. Technicians were continuing with repairs. Scott said, while most of the repairs had been completed, variable delays would continue until the system was completely up and running. The cost of the repair work has not yet been confirmed. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
