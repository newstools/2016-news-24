The welfare of our comrades is something very important &ndash; but some of us relegated the structure to second place [in the] internal dynamics of the ANC," Nyanda said.Nyanda also suggested that suspected attempts to exclude some veterans sparked concern amongst those unsettled by the current state of the MKMVA."We became concerned with the MKMVA when it appeared there were attempts to exclude others, I was never invited... perhaps we have left it too late but we are coming in," Nyanda said.However, some within the MKMVA say they find these comments odd as the organisation "honoured" Nyanda.They have also questioned correctional services deputy minister and former MK member Thabang Makwetla's involvement with the group of veterans "concerned with the welfare of MK" in view of the fact that he was the former deputy minister of defence and military veterans.The challenge on Maphatsoe is not new. Last month, MK members distanced themselves from his labelling of ANC veterans calling for Zuma to step down as "empty tins" "without struggle credentials"."We, as former MK combatants and members strongly condemn these comments and disassociate ourselves from Maphatsoe. He cannot say this in our name. We stand by our veterans and stalwarts who include such individuals as Gertrude Shope, Andrew Mlangeni Ahmed Kathrada, Denis Goldberg, Laloo Chiba, Rashaka Ratshitanga and many others who have also taken a stand against corruption," a statement by Mandla Justice Dlamini said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
