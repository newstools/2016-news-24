Icasa revealed it had laid criminal charges against the SABC on November 29 for failing to adhere to a ruling it made&nbsp;ordering&nbsp;the withdrawal of the SABC's "protest policy".The broadcaster appeared to have reneged on its agreement to abide by the July 11 order to withdraw its decision not to air footage of violent protests, Icasa representative Nomvuyiso Batyi told MPs.Batyi said the SABC never provided any proof of its withdrawal of the policy, despite eventually agreeing to abide by Icasa's order on July 20."As you can imagine, the authority was faced with a dilemma, that here is an entity that advised it would abide by its decision," she told MPs."But later on, we were informed the SABC has never actually canned any programming."Batyi also revealed that Icasa had not approved the SABC's "90-10" local content policy. Motsoeneng, who is now the chief executive of corporate affairs, previously stated he had made the 90-10 decision in 10 minutes during an executive meeting.The committee will sit again on Thursday, where it will interview former board members Vuyo Mavuso, Lulama Mokhobo and Ronny Lubisi, and the last remaining board member Mbulaheni Maguvhe.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
