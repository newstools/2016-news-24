Effects of this spring tide are now in full swing, and peaks will continue to affect the coastline until the end of the upcoming weekend. Spring tide happens twice every month at full moon and at new moon. During this period, the tides bring higher than normal high tides, lower than normal low tides, and stronger than normal rip currents. Over the mentioned period of time, beach-goers as well as coastline hikers are advised to take extreme caution around the coastline, and be aware of the abnormal sea conditions, and its effect on the coastline. Bathers should go to beaches only where and when lifeguards are on duty. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
