Here's how parents and educators can deal with schoolyard bullying.WATCHCape Town &ndash; &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t even finish watching the video. I flung my phone aside and one of my colleagues had to bring me sugar water to calm me down.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the reaction of the mother of a 15-year-old girl after she saw a video of her daughter being bullied,&nbsp;Netwerk24&nbsp;reported on Monday.&nbsp;The video shows the girl, a pupil at L&uuml;ckhoff High School in Idas Valley, Stellenbosch, being attacked on November 24. Classmates filmed it. The mother apparently only became aware of it last week.Neither the mother nor the child may be identified because the girl is a minor.&nbsp;The matter has been reported to police and the Western Cape Education Department.&nbsp;School 'not interested'&ldquo;I also wanted to report it at the school, but they weren&rsquo;t interested in what I had to say,&rdquo; the mother said. She had no idea why the bully, also a girl, targeted her child. &nbsp;&ldquo;She also doesn&rsquo;t know. She says she was playing when the girl stormed her. She says it wasn&rsquo;t the first time. She&rsquo;s been bullied all year long.&rdquo;The video shows the bully beating the other girl&rsquo;s head against her knee, pulling her hair and slapping her in the face.&nbsp;The attack left her bloodied.&nbsp;Provincial education department spokesperson Jessica Shelver said they were aware of the attack.&ldquo;We are concerned about the aggressive nature of the attack. No bullying is allowed in our schools and disciplinary action will be taken.&rdquo;&nbsp;The victim would be offered counselling and support.&nbsp;The girl&rsquo;s mother wanted her classmates to tell her why they failed to intervene.&ldquo;What kind of parent rears a child who instead of helping, stands by and films an attack like this?&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
