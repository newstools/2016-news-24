Only days earlier, Working on Fire volunteers had conducted fire awareness sessions in the settlement. Last November and December almost 1 000 homes were burnt down in separate fires. The community has been reeling from repeated blazes since then, with those affected losing all their possessions. Disaster Management's Charlotte Powell said the Red Cross would provide humanitarian aid to those left homeless and the provincial government's department on human settlements is on the scene conducting an assessment. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
