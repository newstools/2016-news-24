That person took all their people and put them in the finance department.Then, addressing Zuma, who was present at the event, he said, &ldquo;That is why President Zuma you were forced to last year, to reverse the appointment of a finance minister. I don&rsquo;t really know why you bowed to that pressure.&rdquo;He would not elaborate further.&nbsp;Maine was referring to the short-lived appointment of current Minister of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Des van Rooyen as Finance Minister. He was replaced after two days by Pravin Gordhan who had occupied the position in previous years.&nbsp; He went on to say that in future, the media should not be invited to certain ANCYL events because ANC members could not express themselves freely then. He cautioned cadres to be careful about what they said during the event. &ldquo;Next time let us not invite them, because we want to raise important issues,&rdquo; said Maine.He also said anti-transformation was one of the biggest issues facing the country, he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
