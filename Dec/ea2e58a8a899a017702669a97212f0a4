We are not allowed to use a car that has exceeded that, but I'm willing to take that risk so that all the villages might receive water," said Radzilani.She also spoke about the need to refurbish boreholes and to build more water tanks to get water to every household in Vhembe."Since we got into office on 26 August we have received 310 cases of water issues, and out of that 310 we managed to resolve 133. Only 53 villages were getting water, but now 133 villages get water. We hope that soon all the villages will receive water," she said.Radzilani said the municipality had bought five new tankers and were in the process of purchasing two more.Recounting other developments, Radzilani mentioned the successful filling of critical senior positions and restoring "the relationship between the municipality and treasury", which she said was important as Vhembe had been among the more dysfunctional municipalities in the country.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
