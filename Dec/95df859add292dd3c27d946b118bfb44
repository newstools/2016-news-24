To be adopted by the UN's most powerful body a resolution needs nine "yes" votes and no veto by a permanent member.US Ambassador Samantha Power told the council after the vote that the resolution "would not have been a panacea ... but the arms embargo would have had some significant effects" in stemming the flow of weapons.The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has repeatedly called for an arms embargo, warning that "If no action is taken, South Sudan will be on a trajectory towards mass atrocities".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
