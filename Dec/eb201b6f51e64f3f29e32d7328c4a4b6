The organ exhales and inhales about five times per second to collect odours, which are then analysed by about 300 million receptor cells.The team then used a 3D printer to create the outer shell of a plastic "nose" fashioned after the snout of a Labrador retriever.The prosthesis was fitted to a commercially-available explosives detector, which was also reprogrammed to inhale and exhale in quick succession, sniffing in essence, rather than non-stop suction.With the alterations, the machine was 16 times better at detecting odours from a distance of 4cm, the team observed.Though it seemed "counter-intuitive", breathing out during sniffing actually drew odour-laden air towards the nostrils, the researchers found.Dogs are widely used in explosives and drug detection, search and rescue operations and more recently also in cancer diagnosis. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
