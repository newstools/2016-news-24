"Of the 20 who died we have managed to retrieve four bodies from the lake.""We can't at the moment put a finger on what happened. Whether it was overload or the waves", he said adding none of the passengers were wearing life jackets.Bukasa's inhabitants are largely fishermen and farmers. It is a favourite for foreign tourists, though none were among the dead.Deadly accidents are common on Ugandan waters. In November about 10 people drowned when a boat capsized on Lake Albert in northeast Uganda. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
