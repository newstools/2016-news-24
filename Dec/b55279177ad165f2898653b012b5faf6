She began swearing at the people watching her, hitting the child more and even overturned one of the tables, breaking the plates that were on it,&rdquo; said Tjirkos.&ldquo;At this point, I went outside and tried to calm the man down, because I thought that he was making her more angry and I didn&rsquo;t want the situation to get physical. Then the [shopping centre&rsquo;s] security guard arrived on the scene and began comforting the young boy who was crying,&rdquo; he added.Following the incident co-owner Tyrone Dewitt and Tjirkos had a discussion with the woman&rsquo;s husband about the regular customer&rsquo;s behaviour in an effort to ensure the child&rsquo;s safety.&ldquo;It was shocking and, as a father myself, I don&rsquo;t care about what people may be saying about the restaurant &ndash; the thing that matters to me is the boy&rsquo;s well-being. And while we are trying to work with his father, if his response to this is not appropriate, I myself, will take measures to do what&rsquo;s best for the child with authorities,&rdquo; Tjirkos told Fourways Review.Child abuse cases have made news headlines even as the country participates in the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children.In Pretoria, the so-called &ldquo;Springs monster&rdquo; and his wife face charges of abusing their five children including charges of rape and attempted murder.And in KwaZulu-Natal, a woman was charged with negligence recently after she abandoned her 6-month-old baby with a friend to go on a drinking binge.A child abuse probe is also underway at Wynberg Girls High School in in Cape Town after allegations that black girls in the hostel were targeted by the house mother.WATCH the video here (WARNING - graphic content not for sensitive viewers):24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
