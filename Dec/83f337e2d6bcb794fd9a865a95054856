According to the Economic Freedom Fighters, he is the only student countrywide that is still behind bars following university protests earlier this year. He was refused bail in the Durban Magistrate's Court last week and has been behind bars since September 27. He faces charges&nbsp;ranging from public violence and&nbsp;illegal gathering, to trespassing and inciting violence.The case has been held in camera since Khanyile&rsquo;s supporters caused disruptions in the court gallery. The denial of bail raised the ire of EFF supporters, with one of their leaders, Gazuzu Nduli, calling the magistrate a racist outside the court building last week."The magistrate is obviously not neutral in this case. Throughout this case she has shown bias and is very racist in the way she is treating Khanyile. We shall not retreat or surrender."Outside court, an EFF legal representative, Benz Mabengwane, said&nbsp;that his legal team would on Wednesday approach the High Court to urgently seek bail for Khanyile.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
