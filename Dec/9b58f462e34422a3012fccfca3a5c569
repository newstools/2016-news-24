Funding and donations handed over intended to assist the SPCA were simply not received by the organisation. Receipts were not issued for income meant for the SPCA. Money was paid directly into the former employee's bank account," the statement said on Friday.The SPCA said a warrant of arrest had been issued for the former employee and she was arrested after returning from Italy on Thursday afternoon.The association's chairperson Dave Taylor said that even if the full amount in question was paid&nbsp;back&nbsp;to the SPCA, criminal charges against the woman would not be dropped."It is extremely serious, unethical and downright dishonest when funds meant for animals are taken unlawfully. The uMngeni SPCA has been transparent on this matter and issued a media statement when information came to light."The SPCA thanked donors for coming forward with information&nbsp;about funds that were not paid directly into&nbsp;its bank account.&nbsp;Police could not immediately&nbsp;be reached for comment.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
