The court declared that appointment invalid and unconstitutional. Motsoeneng also has to pay costs."I welcome the judgment and I am glad he has to pay costs personally. He must stop wasting tax payer's money on his personal litigation. "His next move is to go to jail," said Maimane.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
