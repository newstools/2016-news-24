Students from households with an annual income of up to R600 000 would not have to pay the increases.Legislation should be used to force corporate South Africa to help fund free education, Mkhari said."We understand that government is ultimately responsible for free education. The university is but a small fish in the pond. It is our collective duty as students to put pressure on government to realise free education. We should go door-to-door to make people understand."The university said on Monday that it was providing financial help for 22 000 out of 37 000 students. It was facing a R56.5m deficit, despite the 8% fee increase."It is unsustainable to continue with a 0% increase. The insourcing that will start from the first of January already costs the university an additional R100m to R120m," spokesperson Shirona Patel said."We tried our best to cut non-academic budgets such as support services." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
