Congolese police put the toll at 20 dead, saying they had largely been killed in "looting" or by "stray bullets".Other sources say somewhere between 56 and 125 people have been killed in a week of clashes, not counting the unknown toll from fighting between security forces and an anti-government militia in the central town of Kananga.Kabila, 45, has been in power since the 2001 assassination of his father Laurent at the height of the Second Congo War.He was confirmed as leader of the mineral-rich nation in 2006 during the first free elections since independence from Belgium in 1960, and re-elected for a second term in 2011 in a vote marred by allegations of massive fraud.Constitutionally banned from seeking a third term, he obtained a controversial court ruling in May stating that he could remain in power until a successor was chosen.DRC has never seen a democratic transfer of power following polls since independence from Belgium in 1960.Two decades ago, the country collapsed into the deadliest conflict in modern African history. Its two wars in the late 1990s and early 2000s pulled in at least six African armies and left more than three million dead. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
