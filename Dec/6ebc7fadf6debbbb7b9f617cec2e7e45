Rescuers had their hands full and a long distance swimmer even jumped in to&nbsp;help struggling bathers&nbsp;to safety.In another incident, a surfer borrowed somebody's boogie board to go out and help bring another struggling&nbsp;bather to the shore. Thursday at 08:53 marks the occurrence of the new moon, which causes dramatic and dangerous strong tides.These tides are expected to last until Monday.The NSRI has advised:&nbsp;- Only go to beaches where lifeguards are on duty, and to swim in the zones demarcated by the lifeguards with their red and yellow flags;- Paddlers and boaters should download the free app, RSA Safetrx, to their cellphones. If they have an emergency, they can just push a button and their exact location will be known.- The main thing to remember in a rip current is to keep calm and alert somebody by shouting or waving your hands.
