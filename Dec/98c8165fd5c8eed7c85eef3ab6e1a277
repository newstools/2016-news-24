She returned without fanfare and died in KwaZulu-Natal in 2016.On the allegations of censorship, Methodist Reverend Alan Storey said that his sermon, which contained the poem, had been recorded on December 11.He said that he was later contacted by SAfm producers who said that they would be editing his sermon to remove the poem.&ldquo;I emailed them back to ask whether it was a copyright issue or one of context. Less than a minute later I got a call and they told me that it was because of the content. According to them they would need to provide a balanced view and that the poem was only one side of the story,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;It is my sermon and it was not up to them to decide what was balanced,&rdquo; Storey added. &nbsp;He said that the sermon was aired without the poem at 08:00 on Sunday.&ldquo;In light of the hearings one would think that they [the SABC] would be a little more conscious of the implications around this,&rdquo; Storey added.Efforts to contact SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago and the radio station were unsuccessful at the time of publishing.Storey's full sermon can be heard here. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
