	     Cape Town – The City of Cape Town has asked residents to take extra care of waste during the festive season to ensure that residential areas stay baboon free. The city's environmental resource management department said on Friday that more waste was generated throughout the holidays than at other times of the year in residential areas which, if not managed effectively, may attract animals,  including baboons. Johan van der Merwe, the city's mayoral committee member for energy, environmental and spatial planning, said city-wide support was needed to keep baboons out of residential areas.  "The city needs your support to create baboon-free residential areas and achieving this requires the co-operation of every resident," Van Der Merwe said.  He encouraged residents to use lockable two-pin "baboon-proof" bins. He said residents can request the bins from their local municipal office.  Baboons have been a protected species in the Western Cape since 2000.  "It is illegal to feed baboons; to poison, trap, hurt or kill a baboon by driving with the intent to kill; hunt by shooting at baboons using a pellet gun, catapult, bow-and-arrow, stoning, setting your dog on them, or use a weapon of any kind in order to injure a baboon; or to keep a baboon in captivity without a permit," Van Der Merwe said.  He encouraged residents to report any baboon-related incidences to the baboon reporting helpline on 071 588 6540. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
