As a result, internally displaced people often did not have access to registry services.A Unicef study two years ago found 2.8 million minors in the country had no legal record of their birth or citizenship status.In 2011, Ivory Coast launched an effort to reduce the number of child workers labouring in the cocoa sector, the country's biggest industry, and get them into schools.Since then, 17,829 classrooms have been built or restored, according to the National Monitoring Committee charged with overseeing the government's anti-child labour efforts.But as of early 2016, between 300 000 and one million children were still estimated to work on cocoa plantations and elsewhere in the industry, according to a report by the International Cocoa Initiative.The July 2105 law making schooling mandatory now carries the threat of prison sentences for parents who keep their children aged six to 16 out of school.The NSIA Foundation, which belongs to the private NSIA banking group and promotes schooling and training for children in West Africa, is providing &euro;275 000 for the registration effort.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
