I haven't heard from her again."MPs asked him what he thought a minister's role should be at the public broadcaster."The role of the minister should be one of political oversight. I just think she came to close to the action at the SABC."WATCH this video:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
