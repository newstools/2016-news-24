"We are marching to build pressure."The starting point was the disused airfield of the Nazi-era Tempelhof Airport, which during the Cold War became the hub for the Berlin airlift and now houses several thousands refugees from Syria, Iraq and other countries.The marchers plan to cover around 20km a day and walk through the Czech Republic, Austria and several western Balkan countries to Turkey - and then on to Syria.It is the route into Europe that was taken last year by more than a million people, many fleeing battlefields in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East, with the majority ending up in the top EU economy Germany.Several thousand people have pledged on Facebook they would join at least a section of the about 3 000km trek bound for Syria's second city, which is now squarely under the control of President Bashar Assad's regime.Backed by Russia and Iran, Syrian troops last week retook control of eastern Aleppo, which had been held by disparate rebel groups since mid-2012, after a devastating month-long offensive that caused tens of thousands of people to flee their homes. Germany has pledged &euro;15m in aid to pay for medical staff and trauma counsellors for the devastated city, Development Minister Gerd M&uuml;ller said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
