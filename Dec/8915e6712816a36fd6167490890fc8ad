To recover the money that is lost by the power utility due to electricity theft, including illegal connections, meter tampering and bypassing and the selling of illegal prepaid vouchers, Eskom is forced to increase the price of electricity, which ultimately affects legal electricity users in the form of increased tariffs."The state has also applied for an investigation into how the four accused benefitted from their illegal activity, which could lead to the seizure of assets including real estate and vehicles.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
