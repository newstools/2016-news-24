Dozens of activists were arrested and arraigned in courts countrywide, charged with public violence.&nbsp;For his part, Mugabe has told the world that he was not going to leave office "as long as I still have the mandate from the people of Zimbabwe".&nbsp;Zimbabwe's opposition parties have long charged that Mugabe lacked legitimacy after he controversially thumped former prime minister Morgan Tsvangirai in the the 2013 national elections that the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) said were rigged.Opposition coalition The parties were now mulling to form a coalition and field a single presidential candidate that would face off with Mugabe and his ruling Zanu PF party.Mkwananzi said #Tajamuka was set to forge an alliance with the country's opposition parties in order to strengthen opposition against Mugabe."We are going to put pressure on all opposition parties to form the coalition in time for the 2018 elections; this (coalition) is the only escape route for Zimbabweans who are faced with rising poverty and are subjected human rights abuses by their government."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
