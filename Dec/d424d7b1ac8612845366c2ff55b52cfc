"I have already confessed to the murder. I will represent myself," Wasief Buxbey, 27, who looked visibly distraught, said during proceedings. Pearce, 20, was found murdered in her mother's locked 4th floor Sea Point apartment nearly two weeks ago. She had been stabbed and some items had been stolen from the flat. Buxbey was arrested last Wednesday. During proceedings on Monday, Magistrate Joe Magele urged him to make use of a legal aid attorney. Buxbey, speaking softly, told the court he did not want to apply for bail. State prosecutor Rui Carvalho asked that the case be postponed until the State had received outstanding witness reports, crime scene photographs and post-mortem results. Magele postponed the matter to March 28, 2017. Buxbey will stay in custody until then.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
