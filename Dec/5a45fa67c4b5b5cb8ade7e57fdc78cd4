One was Thursday, December 1, at 16:00 and the other December 7, also at 16:00.However, she asked that her investigators answer questions in camera because of safety fears.Mkhwebane said the investigators told her they were worried about their safety, given the death threats against SABC staffers who had raised concerns about censorship at the public broadcaster.Mkhwebane said the committee wanted her to attend its meeting on Tuesday, but her office had already scheduled a strategic planning session.DA MP Phumzile van Damme complained that Mkhwebane had said it was her prerogative to decide whether she attended as one of more than 20 witnesses the committee wanted to interview for its probe into the public broadcaster's problems.Mkhwebane took office on October 17. Her first weeks were marked by fallout over the &ldquo;State of Capture&rdquo; which Madonsela oversaw, and suggestions that she was trying to protect President Jacob Zuma, whose son Duduzane was mentioned in the report.The report details allegations that the wealthy Gupta family had a hand in key Cabinet appointments and government contracts.Mkhwebane's reading of the Public Protector Act was that she was not compelled to be a witness. It merely states that she is &ldquo;competent&rdquo; to do so.She instead asked police to investigate who leaked the audio recordings of Madonsela&rsquo;s interviews with President Jacob Zuma, EFF leader Julius Malema, and former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor.Not only was it against the Public Protector Act to leak these, she alleged, but it damaged the credibility of the office and threatened the confidentiality afforded whistleblowers.It was up to the police, not her, to decide whether a crime had been committed.Madonsela had already said she released the recording of her interview with Zuma after he claimed that she had not afforded him the opportunity to reply to her questions.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
