Limpopo police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said Van Rensburg, who was reported missing on Wednesday, was found inside his light aircraft on Thursday morning. The 40-year-old pilot was last seen when he left his home in Zebula, Bela-Bela, to go to Vaalwater on Wednesday morning. "His family became concerned when at around 17:00 he had neither returned nor called them. They started looking for him and realised that he never arrived at Vaalwater," he said. Police launched a search and his remains were found inside the crashed craft. He is believed to have died instantly. The cause of the crash had not yet been established, Ngoepe said, and an inquest docket had been opened. "The police investigations are continuing in conjunction with [that of] the Civil Aviation Authority." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
