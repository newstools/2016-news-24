Two police sources confirmed to News24 that a man had been walking to the FNB in Musgrave to deposit money when he realised he was being followed and if he did nothing, was soon to be the victim of a robbery. The man broke into a run and rushed inside the bank, flinging the bag of money behind the enquiries counter. A man brandishing a rifle was on his heels and without hesitating, jumped the counter to purloin the bag. He made a hasty retreat.
