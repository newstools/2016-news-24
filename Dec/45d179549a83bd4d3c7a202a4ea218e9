Kalisha.NaickerTHE ANC national elective conference in 2017 will be a very interesting one and will determine its aim to win the national elections in 2019.However, it can only be a fruitful exercise if ANC members engage continuously on organisational issues and decide what type of leadership they want after President Jacob Zuma. The quality of leadership is fundamental to determine the level of popular confidence and whether we are able to implement our policies and realise strategic objectives.Therefore we should ask ourselves, when and why did leadership transition become a problem for the ANC? If we agree with a historical interpretation that leadership contestation has been part of the organisational culture of the ANC, when and why did leadership transition become a problem in the ANC?What are the manifestations of this problem and how do they impact on the ability of the ANC to pursue its mission?This is the challenge that the life of O.R. Tambo places before us today. Through the example of his life, he continues to warn ANC members that we should avoid the pitfall of doing the opposite of what his life presented.Tambo represents the best example of how good leaders can contribute to forging excellence and to raising the movement s performance.Therefore, I would prefer that in the upcoming ANC national conference, the contestation of positions does not take place, for the sake of unity. Instead, the focus must remain on the culture of the movement and the president must be succeeded by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa after Zuma s term.The leaders I think can rescue the ANC are: national chair Gwede Mantashe, deputy president Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, secretary-general David Makhura or Joel Netshitenzhe and Treasury general Enoch Godongwana. Without ignoring the ANCWL s call that it s their turn to lead, their candidate could be prepared for the position in order to get full support from the membership.THABANG MASEKOANC Yure Mdyogol BEC memberIn his personal capacity24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
