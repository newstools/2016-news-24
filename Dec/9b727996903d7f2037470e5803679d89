It has been embroiled in clashes between the armed forces of Marshal Khalifa Haftar and jihadists holding onto pockets of the city.Despite the victory over ISIS in Sirte, Kobler warned that the jihadists "continue to be a threat.""The fight against terrorism produced results. However, the gains are not irreversible," he said.The recapture of Sirte could strengthen the UN-backed unity government of prime minister-designate Fayez al-Sarraj, aimed at replacing the two rival administrations fighting for power in Libya.The GNA, established in March, has not been able to solidify its authority despite the support of some militias.It is challenged by Haftar in the east and Khalifa Ghweil, leader of the former Tripoli-based Government of National Salvation.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
