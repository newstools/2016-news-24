"Democracy does not come from the sky, it won't come from America or Europe, we are the ones who have to fight for it" Rwanda is regularly praised for its stability and economic performance but criticised for a lack of political freedoms.Several opposition parties - including the United Democratic Forces (FDU) - are not officially recognised and cannot participate in elections.FDU leader Victoire Ingabire was arrested in 2010 while campaigning against Kagame.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
