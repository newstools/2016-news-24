She suffered some smoke inhalation and some burns to her fur.&rdquo;He said the dog was visibly shaken by the incident as she was found in a state of shock.&ldquo;She was rushed to a local veterinary hospital and in a stable condition. She suffered first degree burns to her body and carbon monoxide poisoning.
