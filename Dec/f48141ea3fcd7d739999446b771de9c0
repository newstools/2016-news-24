Lynn.HitchcockTHE festive season is ahead and people with sinister intentions are targeting Sassa beneficiaries with the intention of cheating them through all sorts of scams. Social grant beneficiaries have been inundated with text messages urging them to obtain new cards, which are green in colour before January, 2017. Sassa never communicates with beneficiaries via SMS and beneficiaries are warned not to respond to any SMS these imposters send to them.Sassa advises all beneficiaries not to fall for this scam because there are no new Sassa cards and it is not true that beneficiaries should get these cards before 1 January, 2017. Beneficiaries should be on the lookout for people requesting their personal and card details pretending to be from Sassa. Sassa said it conducts businesses from its own offices and beneficiaries should not accept invitations to any other office. The other thing that beneficiaries should be aware of is that the Sassa card is not green in colour. The only valid Sassa card has the colours of the South African flag and it will never be replaced by a card that is green in colour, said Sassa national spokesperson, Kgomoco Diseko. The danger of responding to these scams is that beneficiaries could be stripped of their cash or unusual deductions, which they never authorised, would come off their grants. Beneficiaries must not give their personal details or card details to strangers because this can lead to identity theft. Once a criminal syndicate has your personal details, they can commit fraud using your name, said Diseko. Beneficiaries should ignore the SMS message and if unsure, they should call Sassa on 0800 60 10 11. - Supplied.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
