See pictures of west African leaders who are in Gambia to urge Yahya Jammeh to respect elections that voted him out of power after 22 years. Cape Town &ndash; Gambia&rsquo;s president-elect Adama Barrow has said that he will declare himself president on January 18 if Yahya Jammeh does not leave office, according to BBC.Jammeh last week declared he no longer accepted results of the December 1 vote, in a stunning turnaround that sapped hopes for a peaceful political transition for the west African state.Jammeh, 51, cited "unacceptable errors" by election authorities and called for fresh polls. "In the same way that I accepted the results faithfully believing that the Independent Electoral Commission was independent and honest and reliable, I hereby reject the results in totality," Jammeh said in a speech broadcast on state television.Barrow, however,&nbsp;called on the longtime leader to drop his challenge.&nbsp;West Africa leader, who headed to Gambia this week to try and resolve the issue, said no deal was reached for Jammeh to leave power.&nbsp;"...There is not something that can happen in one day. It's something that one has to work on," Liberian leader Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was quoted as saying.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
