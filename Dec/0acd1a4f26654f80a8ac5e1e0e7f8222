Gavin Faustmann of Pinetown and Jacques Rheeder of Waterfall were allegedly&nbsp;found in possession of illicit images.Accused Number 1 in the matter, who hails from the Bluff, may not be named as he has also been charged with rape, sexual assault, and the sexual grooming of a 6-year-old child. He may not be named so as to protect the child's identity.According to information placed before the court, the sordid web was unravelled when Faustmann&rsquo;s IP address was logged by the US Department of Homeland Security after he accessed a flagged child pornography website. Thereafter, a warrant of arrest was issued and during the course of his detention, his electronic equipment was seized. Faustmann then allegedly revealed the identities of Accused 1 and Rheeder, who were subsequently arrested. The child was identified as Accused 1&rsquo;s neighbour, and after investigators took a statement from the girl, it emerged that she may have been raped. Faustmann broke down in the dock after the three were remanded in custody for a formal bail application next week. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
