Xalisa asked.In October, Van Rooyen tried twice to interdict the release of the former Public Protector's report into "state capture".The report included details of Van Rooyen's numerous visits to the controversial Gupta family.Email trailREAD: Des van Rooyen a 'regular visitor' to Gupta home - reportMeanwhile, in another response, the minister refused to answer questions regarding his advisor, Ian Whitley, and Trillian Capital Partners CEO Eric Wood.Democratic Alliance MP Kevin Mileham asked if Van Rooyen had had any discussions with Wood and Whitley regarding the use of municipal assets to secure debt financing before or after his appointment to the finance and Cogta ministries."If not, what is the position in this regard; if so, what was the nature of each discussion and why did he have discussions with the specified persons," Mileham asked.He also asked if Van Rooyen would make a statement on this matter.Van Rooyen did not take him up on the offer."The Honourable Member is kindly advised that this matter is sub judice," the minister said.This related to media reports in the Sunday Times that there was an email trail between Van Rooyen and a Gupta-linked company.The trail apparently links Van Rooyen, Whitley and Wood, and indicates that Wood knew in October, two months in advance, that Zuma was going to fire former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
