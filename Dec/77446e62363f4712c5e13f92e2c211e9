In January 2013, Mozambique cast doubt over why the miner made a $3bn writedown on its Mozambican assets - an amount that contributed to Rio chief executive Tom Albanese losing his job the same month.After spending close to $4 billion acquiring Australian-listed Riversdale Mining in 2011, Rio Tinto said it struggled with the cost of transporting coal from mines to market.But Mozambique expressed dissatisfaction with the explanation.Albanese resigned also as Rio suffered impairments of $10-11bn, mostly related to the 2007 purchase of aluminium firm Alcan. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
