You must galvanise the masses to be ready for a revolution. You cannot galvanise the masses that are not organised,&rdquo; he said. Zuma was speaking at an ANCYL economic freedom lecture at Durban&rsquo;s City Hall to a capacity crowd. He highlighted the importance of economics saying that without an economy, policies could not be implemented. &ldquo;The economy is very important. If you don&rsquo;t have an economy, your freedom is not complete.&rdquo;Zuma went on to say that people in politics often found it hard to let go of councillor positions. He added that he would volunteer to assist the ANC when he retires and that &ldquo;I will not be looking for money&rdquo;. He said he would not mind a councillor position. &ldquo;I will be very happy if I am elected as a councillor in Nkandla.&rdquo;Zuma said that it was not the position held that counted, but the organisation that a person worked for. &ldquo;If the organisation says 'Zuma, Nkandla has been bothering us, canvass so then you can be a mayor&rsquo;s councillor', what would be the problem there?&rdquo;ANC provincial chairperson Sihle Zikalala assured Zuma that he was &ldquo;not going anywhere&rdquo;.&ldquo;We are not rushing for 2017 but we are not afraid of it either.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
