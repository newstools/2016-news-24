He told the paper at the time that he was not surprised that his wife had then been appointed as defence minister because she "was a fairly senior minister already".During the interview, he revealed that while visiting his home country he preferred to stay "in his rural home in Bondo because it is cheaper".He was a man who reportedly never forgot "his Kenyan roots".The couple met in exile and reportedly married in 1996.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
