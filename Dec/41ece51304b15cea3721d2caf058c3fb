"The fact is that in some areas we lost support. We need to go back and regain that same support," he said on Sunday. Mthethwa was speaking at a KwaZulu-Natal ANC Youth League lecture at the Durban City Hall. Mthethwa addressed a packed hall of various&nbsp;youth league&nbsp;branches in the province calling on members to come together and stop infighting. "Do not fall into traps of people who conduct themselves through insults. Ours should be the supremacy of our argument."He urged members of the youth wing of the party to focus on communities and issues on the ground. "The revolution is about the people. If you forget about the masses you are lost. We want to reconnect with the branches of the ANC to reconnect with the people on the ground."He further cautioned members of the party to not think individualistically. He said that during party conferences, the main focus should be an agenda that "talks to the people".Mthethwa said that during conferences, members should be allowed to lobby themselves. However, he&nbsp;urged lobby groups not to become factions. "The mistake you should not make is after conference you continue working through these lobby groups. If you do that, you are no longer lobby groups, you are now factions."Mthethwa added that the ANC would declare 2017 the year of anti-apartheid hero Oliver Tambo. He would have been 100 years old.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
