Jeff Wicks and Kaveel Singh, News24Durban - Protestors&nbsp;in Springtown erected burning barricades and hurled stones at cars on Umgeni Road on Monday. This follows similar action last week when protestors blocked the road after shacks were demolished in the informal settlement. On Monday residents set fire to tires and refuse in the roadway before stoning cars, prompting metro police to intervene.Burning barricades on Umgeni Road at Springtown.
