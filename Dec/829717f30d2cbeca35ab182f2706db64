Ramaphosa said there were those who wanted a review of property rights enshrined in the document.&nbsp; "Some say the Constitution has robbed us of a proper land redistribution process. Others would want to look at other clauses. Well, it&rsquo;s South Africa. Everything is transparent and open for debate,"&nbsp;he said in Parliament on Wednesday, at the launch of a book commemorating the 20th anniversary of the Constitution.&nbsp;The book, Reflections on the Bill of Rights, was compiled by veterans from across political parties who had helped draw up the Constitution.&nbsp;They included National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete, IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, former DA MP Sheila Camerer, and FF Plus chief whip Corn&eacute; Mulder. &nbsp;Ramaphosa referred to people who say the transformation process has failed, that democracy is under siege and then ask if some things agreed upon in 1996 shouldn&rsquo;t be reviewed.&nbsp;&ldquo;These are all legitimate questions. We can always reconsider what we agreed upon then."However, I&rsquo;d still want us to handle the Constitution with care. There are many people who see it as a sell-out because there were too many compromises," he said."We have to have a good look at the Constitution. Let&rsquo;s determine where the shortcomings are. Then we can start talking of clauses,"&nbsp;Ramaphosa paid tribute to those who drew up the Constitution."It is an excellent Constitution. There are shortcomings and we might not be quite there yet, but we&rsquo;ve come a long way."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
