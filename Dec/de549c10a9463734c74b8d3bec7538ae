We do not know what caused the fire, but it is being investigated. Our damage is roughly estimated at about R160 000 and it includes our computer equipment as well as other emergency equipment, said Moodie.According to Solly Luyt, Relay EMS Uitenhage client relations officer, there are rumours that Relay has closed-down. This is absolute nonsense. We are up and running as always and we now just operate from a brand new and much more suitable office across the road at 38 Cuyler Street. Luckily with the off-site back-up data system in place we did not experience any loss of information or data, said Luyt.The Relay office was next to an electrical installation business as well as a herbalist. We wish to thank all for their support, the fire brigade, Cuyler Hospital, Udipa and the many other people involved, said Moodie.Uitenhage Relay EMS contact number stays the same: 0861 061 061. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
