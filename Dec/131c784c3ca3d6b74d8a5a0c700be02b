If you think about it, they are not spending that much. It costs R800 easily these days for a meal plus wine for two people.&rdquo;Klugman sees the festival as a rite of passage to adulthood for matrics.&ldquo;They work hard during the year and now they are done with school and can legally drink and are entitled to a party and the festival allows them to do that in a controlled environment,&rdquo; he said.According to Klugman, the festival serves a commercial need but the organisers realise that they have a huge social responsibility.&ldquo;For many of them it is the first time at a music festival and we are sensitive about it. We go to a lot of trouble to ensure their safety.&rdquo;He said the matrics are not allowed to drive into the festival grounds to prevent them driving drunk.&nbsp;Some festivalgoers complained about the free transport system and in response, they have brought in extra buses to shorten queues, Klugman said.&ldquo;Of course matrics are going to party and be into each other and that is just how it goes. That&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are not running a missionary station here. It is rock &lsquo;n roll here,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;When you become a student life becomes more serious. This is the free-est they&rsquo;ll ever be. All they have to do, is to party.&rdquo;&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
