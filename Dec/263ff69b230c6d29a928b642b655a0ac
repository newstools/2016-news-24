The churches had reportedly been advocating for abortion to be allowed only under certain circumstances.&nbsp;The churches said that "human life begins at conception and therefore abortion should not be permitted".Nyasa Times, however, quoted the country's information minister Malisen Ndau as denying reports that the government was planning on introducing "pro-abortion laws"."The truth of the matter is that the Law Commission has developed a report and made recommendations to government to adopt a new law on abortion."Currently, the law on abortion is governed by the Penal Code. Sections 149, 150, 151 and 243 of the Penal Code prohibit termination of pregnancy except where the life of the mother is threatened. This is the status of the law," Ndau was cited as saying.Abortion was currently punishable by at least 14 years behind bars in the southern African country. Homosexuality, on the other hand, was also punishable by at least 14 years - and according to reports, the government recently said it would carry out a review about whether to repeal the country's anti-homosexuality laws.Update: Pictures from the anti-abortion march in Lilongwe pic.twitter.com/OUWGE4BgmU#pro_life_demo The march attracted almost all denominations in the country including the Rastafari pic.twitter.com/i8rNW6rWsE&mdash; Malawi Nation (@MalawiNation) December 6, 2016 #pro_life_demo The march attracted almost all denominations in the country including the Rastafari pic.twitter.com/i8rNW6rWsE 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
