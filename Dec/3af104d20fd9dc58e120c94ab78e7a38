It is about freedom of choice. We don't criminalise alcohol or tobacco,&rdquo; he said.Prince's career as a lawyer ended when the Cape Law Society would not admit him because he was convicted of drug possession as a student.Fourteen years ago, his lawyers argued in the Constitutional Court that, as a Rastafarian, he used dagga for spiritual and religious purposes.He lost the case and became a legal adviser.&ldquo;It changed my life completely. I can only give people legal advice and help them to prepare for a case. I cannot go into court and represent them,&rdquo; he told News24 in August.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
