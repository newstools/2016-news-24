The armed group has abducted tens of thousands of children for use as soldiers and sexual slaves, and killed and maimed thousands of civilians in remote regions of northern Uganda, northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan and the Central African Republic.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
