The question of Kabila's succession has triggered a renewed political crisis in DRC, a vast resource-rich nation riven for decades by rival power struggles.The Security Council was due to adopt a unanimous declaration initiated by France demanding that the country's political actors reach a "broad consensus towards free, fair, credible, inclusive, transparent, peaceful and timely presidential and legislative elections leading to a peaceful transfer of power."Kabila, who has been elected to two presidential terms, is barred from serving again but has never said he plans to step aside.Last month, he cut a power-sharing deal, appointing fringe opposition politician Samy Badibanga as prime minister in a move that effectively extends his term to at least late 2017.Kabila came to power after the murder of his father Laurent-Desire Kabila by a bodyguard in 2001 during the Second DRC War, which ended two years later.Elected in 2006, he went on to win a second five-year term in a 2011 vote that the opposition decried as rigged.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
