All motions received in terms of the rules will be before the AGM. UCT confirms that notice of a motion has been received, seeking the Convocation to consider a vote of no-confidence in the Vice-Chancellor and his senior Executive," he said.The university would not discuss the matter as it was meant to be dealt with at the AGM next week. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
