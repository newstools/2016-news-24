He would also not attend the council meeting. Yengeni said this was because he had prior engagements.Some pundits had seen the event as a move to challenge MKMVA leader Kebby Maphatsoe&rsquo;s hold on the organisation. The former combatants however said their intervention was not focused on an individual.Maphatsoe has been criticised for using the association to fight factional battles in the ANC, instead of focusing on its members' needs.&ldquo;We are not going to discuss Kebby the person. This is a meeting to look at challenges facing the organisation and how former members can contribute to stabilising the organisation,&rdquo; Yengeni said.They would evaluate the MKMVA&rsquo;s performance to see if it had fulfilled the role it should have in the lives of former combatants.The council is set to take place in Nasrec, Soweto, from 09:00 on Saturday.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
