In the video a Metro policeman is seen pointing a firearm at the man who is carrying a knife. The man, wearing a blue cap and a jacket, then starts chasing around the Metro police around the Hyundai. Police wearing bullet proof vests then arrive on the scene and try to apprehend the man pointing firearms at him. The man is then seen trying to talk to someone who was inside the Isizu before heading to the red Hyundai. He gets out of the vehicle and appears to be threatening the group of frightened officers. The police eventually pounce on the man, grabbing the knife out of his hand before forcing him to the ground.
