The doctors in this country have been taken on a goose chase for so long," said Ouma Oluga of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union.Corruption-plagued countryHe said that from Tuesday next week "all hospitals will be closed, be it private or public".A judge on Wednesday ordered union officials to appear in court next Tuesday, threatening them with jail for disobeying a court order to call off the strike.Judge Helen Wasiliwa said that if they did not show up she would order their arrest.The strike led to chaos outside hospitals earlier this week, with bystanders helping women give birth, and more than 100 patients escaping from Kenya's only psychiatric hospital in the capital Nairobi.At least 14 patients are reported to have died in public hospitals due to lack of care, President Uhuru Kenyatta said Wednesday."We are ready to dialogue with our doctors and nurses. Let's be mindful of the lives of our people," he said. However Kenyatta and his government have received short shrift on social media, where supporters of the strike question the loss of millions of dollars in the corruption-plagued country, while doctors battle to secure wage increases."It is appalling that Kenya cannot pay its doctors a decent salary, while billions are shamelessly stolen from the public coffers," said an editorial in the Daily Nation this week.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
