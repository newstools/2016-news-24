"If there are people who still discriminate against others on the grounds of their race, religion and colour it means that we are still far behind in reaching the goal of&nbsp;a united nation. We need to build a nation free from racism and from any form of discrimination," he said. "We must condemn this scourge, not offering a safe haven to those with racist attitudes in our society. Condemnation against this kind of behaviour is not enough but such rotten elements must be arrested and prosecuted. We must not allow people to be treated in such a manner in a democratic country by self-centred racists. South Africa is a glass house that must be guarded and protected against such practices," he added. "As the IFP we condemn the persistence and resurgence of violent ideologies based on racial or national prejudice. We also condemn political platforms and organisations based on racism; xenophobia or doctrines of racial superiority and related discrimination. Such attitudes are incompatible with democracy and freedom," Gwala said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
