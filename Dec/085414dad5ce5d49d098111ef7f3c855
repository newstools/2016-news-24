When it got to the mountain, it first assisted a woman who had injured her shoulder in Woody Ravine, said WSAR spokesperson Johann Marais."By that time, the guys had already reported low clouds and strong winds. We&rsquo;ve organised guys to go and assist them. It is going to be easier to carry the body up and across the mountain to the Cable Car."By 16:00, the Table Mountain Cable Way&rsquo;s operations were suspended. An alert on its Twitter account stated: "Temperature at the top is mild, wind strength is strong, visibility intermittent."Marais said the alternative plan was for rescue teams to carry the body down on a stretcher.Two teams of 10 people usually alternated carrying a stretcher down the path. The strenuous task could take up to five hours.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
