Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi on Tuesday confirmed that the case had been registered. &ldquo;This stems from serious allegations about a plot against senior government officials, the information of which was sourced from reliable sources.&rdquo; &ldquo;We are however not in a position to divulge the contents of the affidavit, the alleged senior government officials targeted and the so called plotters,&rdquo; he said. McBride said he would hold a press conference on the matter on Tuesday. O&rsquo;Sullivan orchestrating 'a fully-fledged revolt' The affidavit, understood to have been deposed by Mokotedi, details a secret meeting of O&rsquo;Sullivan, Mcbride and Sibiya at a house which once belonged to Czech fugitive Radovan Krecjir. It claims that members of Afriforum and the Democratic Alliance were also party to the surreptitious rendezvous aimed at identifying certain people &ldquo;as targets for vexatious criminal investigations and shaming in the media&rdquo;. The apparent motive, says the affidavit, is their proximity to President Jacob Zuma. Those to be smeared are&nbsp;listed in the affidavit as: &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acting National Police Commissioner Kgomotso Phahlane. &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hawks head Berning Ntlemeza &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prince Mokotedi &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Shaun Abrahams &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Newly-appointed State Security Agency head Arthur Fraser&ldquo;The attendees agreed that Mr Paul O&rsquo;Sullivan should collect information and dig dirt that would implicate the aforementioned persons in any kind of transgressions especially on corruption and other acts of criminality,&rdquo; the affidavit reads.&ldquo;The group held discussions on several matters that the Ipid is investigating against Phahlane and Ntlemeza, and that those cases must be finalized&nbsp;in within the next month and be submitted to the NPA for decision. The group further agreed that should the NPA decline to prosecute, AfriForum and the DA should pursue a private prosecution.&rdquo; In the affidavit Mokotedi alleges that his informant suggested that O&rsquo;Sullivan should &ldquo;identify more journalists who would be willing to publish stories on the targeted group.&rdquo; &ldquo;Information on the targeted persons and put pressure on the politicians to have these targeted individuals removed from office. It was disclosed by the group that Paul O&rsquo;Sullivan has collected damaging evidence against Mr Duduzane Zuma, the President&rsquo;s son, and that information can be used to mobilise the community to revolt and pressure the president to quit office,&rdquo; his affidavit says. He suggested that O&rsquo;Sullivan was trying to orchestrate a fully-fledged revolt.&ldquo;The meeting on the 3rd of December 2016 was meant to concretise and put into action a plan to destabilize the security forces of the country and oust the President of the country through popular revolt,&rdquo; he wrote, in justifying is allegation of high treason. Efforts to contact O&rsquo;Sullivan, McBride and Mokotedi were unsuccessful at the time of publishing.&nbsp;Courting controversyMokotedi was parachuted into the position following the departure of Sibiya, who was fired last year following a disciplinary hearing which found him guilty of orchestrating the so-called Zimbabwe renditions. Mokotedi had courted controversy at the National Prosecuting Authority while he headed the Integrity Management Unit. He resigned and bowed out before facing disciplinary action on multiple charges of misconduct, for allegedly leaking a report at the culmination of an investigation he initiated and steered into former prosecutor Glynnis Breytenbach.&nbsp; According to his charge sheet, Mokotedi had expanded on the scope of an investigation into medical schemes without authorisation and then, without approval, had submitted the report, which purported to focus on Breytenbach, to the police.He was accused of breaching the NPA&rsquo;s media policy, contravening the NPA&rsquo;s code of conduct, contravening Section 41(6) of the NPA ACT, gross insubordination, conducting investigations without approval, improper disclosure of investigation reports, failure to comply with the NPA whistle-blower policy, dissemination of false information and bringing the NPA into disrepute.When news of the report&nbsp;made headline news, Mokotedi raised eyebrows by publicly defending himself on live talk radio, which resulted in a new charge of breaching the NPA&rsquo;s media policy.News24 previously reported that several months into his tenure in his current job, Mokotedi was unable to secure the appropriate security clearance that his job required. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
