We will not tolerate any form of behaviour that threatens the safety and well-being of health professionals and health facility support staff, who render such important work.&rdquo;Dhlomo said the work that clinical staff perform was sacrosanct and should never be undermined.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
