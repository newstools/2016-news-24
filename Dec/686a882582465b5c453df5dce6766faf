But Maya was the only dog who ate the meat while the Germishuizens&rsquo; other family dog, Joey, did not. Matthew said Joey was more aggressive and since he did not eat the meat, the burglars may have been deterred.The brother and sister said their family had Maya since she was a puppy and were &ldquo;relieved&rdquo; and &ldquo;thankful&rdquo; that she would be okay.&ldquo;It was really touch and go for a while, but the vet said if she made it through the night, she would probably be okay,&rdquo; said Matthew.&ldquo;She is still not herself and is a little confused, but much better than she was last night.&rdquo;He said his family alerted Magma Security who inspected the property and had been keeping a close eye on their house and their road.Clarendon Veterinary Clinic vet, Dr John Carlyon, treated Maya and said although it was a suspected poisoning, it could not be confirmed.Clarendon Community Watch chairperson, Rowan White urged residents to be wary and to have a good relationship with neighbours who would be able to raise an alarm if something went wrong.He added that people should also ask their domestic workers, who are on the property when the owners are away, to monitor the front lawn and keep an eye out for suspicious behaviour.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
