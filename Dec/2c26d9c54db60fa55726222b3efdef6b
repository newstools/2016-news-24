The species may move more slowly while hunting and it can only maintain top speeds for a few hundred meters.More than half of the world's cheetahs live in southern Africa, including in Namibia and Botswana, which have relatively sparse human populations. Cheetahs have been virtually wiped out in Asia, save for fewer than 50 in Iran, according to the study, whose contributors included the Panthera group and the Wildlife Conservation Society.Durant said there was uncertainty over the 7 100 number, which was based on data from experts in areas where cheetahs live and estimates for other areas. Cheetahs are difficult to find because they move over vast regions, she said.Durant also led a previous assessment of nearly 6 700 cheetahs published last year by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which keeps a watch list of threatened species. Since then, experts have provided new information and refined counting methods, contrasting with rough estimates in the 10 000-range in recent decades.Decline in ZimThe cheetah population in Zimbabwe declined from an estimated 1 500 in 1999 to between 150 and 170, according to a survey conducted between 2013 and 2015 by a group called Cheetah Conservation Project Zimbabwe. The group solicited cheetah photographs and reports of sightings from tourists, safari guides and others and interviewed more than 1 000 people, including village heads and cattle managers.Cheetah experts note that Angola is developing a plan to protect cheetahs and African wild dogs. That could yield better data on cheetah numbers in a country where information has been thin, said Rosemary Groom, a conservationist who participated in an October workshop on the subject in Angola's Quicama National Park.Despite habitat loss across the continent, the Mara area in south-west Kenya and in the adjacent Serengeti National Park in Tanzania still offers a refuge, said Femke Broekhuis, head of the Mara Cheetah Project. Recent data from a GPS collar on one Mara cheetah showed that it travelled 19 kilometres overnight, she said.Cheetahs often roam alone, though on Monday morning Broekhuis saw a rare sight: five male cheetahs, together.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
