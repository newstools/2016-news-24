With what he [Mugabe] said, can he excuse himself or really absolve himself? Why did he mention those things in the first place?" the 61 year old former long-time Mugabe ally was quoted as saying.Mujuru, now the leader of the opposition Zimbabwe People First (ZimPF) party, said her allegations were backed by what Mugabe has been saying, particularly after her expulsion from the ruling Zanu-PF party last year when she was accused of attempting to unseat and possibly assassinate Mugabe.Mujuru insisted that her husband was killed by his political foes, after he had been handpicked by the ruling Zanu-PF committee to work on a Mugabe succession plan.According to a&nbsp;NewsDay&nbsp;report, Mujuru said that the committee was chaired by the late vice president John Nkomo and had Defence Minister Sydney Sekeramayi and her husband as members.The report cited&nbsp;former Zanu-PF politburo member - now late - Cephas Msipa as having spoken in the past about the succession committee.&nbsp;Msipha reportedly said that Mugabe had&nbsp;appointed Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Joice and then party chairperson, Nkomo to identify his heir.The committee, however, "died a natural death before even meeting once, as Mugabe changed goalposts and blocked discussions over the issue", the report quoted Msipha as saying.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
