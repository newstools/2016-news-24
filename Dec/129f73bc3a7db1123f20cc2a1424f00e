The grass is tall and weeds flourish.The health department gave the department of public works until December 23 to sort out the problems. &nbsp;In was reported in August that health officials had previously&nbsp;inspected the building. It was classified as unsafe and the Hawks were prohibited from going inside.Now, four months down the line, apparently nothing has been done to solve the problems.&nbsp;The building belongs to the department of public works, which is also responsible for its upkeep.Thami Mchunu, the department&rsquo;s national spokesperson, said that they had submitted an application for financing to the&nbsp;police and were still waiting for approval.&nbsp;He said they could only start doing maintenance once they received the money.&nbsp;Hawks&rsquo; national spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaidzi confirmed in August that new premises had been approved for the Hawks, but that he didn&rsquo;t know how long it would be before they moved there.&nbsp;He later said it was no longer a matter for the Hawks to deal with and that it was in the hands of the police.&nbsp;However, Western Cape police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andre Traut said that the SAPS had nothing to do with the process and that it was the responsibility of the Hawks.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
