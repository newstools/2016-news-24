There were plans for another 150 000 grave sites.In the statement, it said the Klip Road Cemetery in Grassy Park and the Welmoed Cemetery in Blackheath had been extended.New cemeteries &ndash; including in Delft, Khayelitsha, Wallacedene and Atlantis &ndash; had either been partially developed or developed from scratch.Availability of land a challenge"There are many residents of Cape Town whose cultural and/or religious beliefs require the burial of deceased persons. For many people cremation may therefore never be an option," said mayoral committee member for community services Anda Ntsodo."It is our duty to respect the wishes of our communities and it is for this reason that the City commits millions of rands every year to the development of cemetery space."In Cape Town, we currently have enough burial space to accommodate another 10 years of burials at the current demand."Ntsodo said the availability of land posed the biggest challenge when developing cemeteries."There are many competing interests for every piece of land in our city, including housing, social facilities, business premises and biodiversity conservation."Also, when land is identified for cemetery development, the environmental and land use approval processes take between seven and 10 years on average to complete."Most funerals took place on Saturdays and in the statement, the City encouraged residents to consider weekday burials so that cemeteries would be less crowded over weekends.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
