Plans for Public Order Policing operations should identify the means of communication which SAPS members will use to communicate with each other."A protocol should be developed and implemented for communication in large operations including alternative mechanisms where the available radio system is such that it will not provide adequate means of communication."Phiyega suspendedAfter the multiple killings at Marikana, Zuma established the commission of inquiry, chaired by retired judge Ian Farlam, to look into the matter.It found that no senior government officials, including Lonmin non-executive board member Cyril Ramaphosa, were responsible for the shootings.It however recommended a probe into police commissioner Riah Phiyega's fitness to hold office. Zuma suspended Phiyega in October last year. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
