Frank Chikowore, News24 Harare - Zimbabwe's new surrogate currency is called a dollar and worth a dollar but a visit to the country's banks may be worth nothing. The majority of Zimbabweans are failing to access the new bond notes introduced by theÂ central bank last week in an attempt to avert a liquidity crunch that has left the country's money markets and national economy paralysed. Scores of people are now having to brave the wet and sometimes chilly weather to join bank queues at night in order to increase their chances of accessing the limited amounts being offered to depositors by financial institutions.

Mashakada said the solution to the crisis was "political". "We need a new man at State House who has new economic policies that work; the bond notes have not in any way addressed the cash problems faced by the Zimbabwean people," Mashakada told News24.
