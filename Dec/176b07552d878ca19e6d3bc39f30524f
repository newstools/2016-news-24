Heilie Combrinck It has come to the attention of a dentist from Uitenhage that a man is going around Uitenhage and Despatch doing illegal repair work on dentures and introducing himself as an employee of Dr Singh. “The only information we have is that the man is called Rasta and that he has a look which suits his name. He goes around from house to house, introducing himself as a staff member of Dr Singh.  “He then says that we have send him to check whether there are any people who need denture repair work done,” said Dr Singh, who owns an established dental practice in Uitenhage. “We wish to inform residents of Uitenhage and Despatch that my practice has never instructed anybody to do repair work outside of the practice. All dental work is being done at our lab which is situated at our premises,” said Dr Singh. He requests people with dentures which need repair work being done not to give it to this person or to give him any money. “He will disappear with the money and the dentures. And because it is an illegal operation it is likely that the police will not be able to help you find this person or your dentures. “This means that you have become a victim of a scam and it is your responsibility to inform the dentist and the police should you be confronted with this person,” said Dr Singh. According to Dr Singh, the con man usually gives different addresses where he is staying. The latest was in Flamingo Flats, Uitenhage. Dr Singh said they don’t know for how long this has been going on and how many people have fallen prey to his scam. “We received a phone call last week from someone wanting confirmation that ‘Rasta’ is working for our practice.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
