The first two took place ahead of the ANC&rsquo;s last national executive committee meeting for 2016, held at the end of November.The NEC agreed to the veterans&rsquo; request to hold a consultative conference. However, the ANC said it would dedicate two days of its policy conference in June 2017 to discussing the state of the organisation and ways to fix it.&ldquo;We are talking about the renewal of the ANC as a whole. This goes beyond individuals. We are not doing this solely for ourselves,&rdquo; political activist and businesswoman Barbara Masekela said.It was the party&rsquo;s mandate to govern South Africa and drive social change, said former minister of safety and security Sydney Mufamadi. Whatever happened with the ANC was of interest to society in general, he said.The stalwarts said there would be a preparatory committee which would meet ANC leaders to discuss the two conferences.ANC veteran Gertrude Shope said the situation reminded her of those who left the country to fight for freedom, but couldn&rsquo;t make it back to South Africa.&ldquo;The only thank you we can give to them is to build our organisation and nation to a level where everyone can feel and accept that South Africa is a democratic country,&rdquo; the former ANC Women&rsquo;s League president said.The veterans said they would attend a conference hosted by former commissars and commanders of Umkhonto we Sizwe, an event ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe had previously said was outside party structures.The MK council meeting is spearheaded by former MK general and South African National Defence force chief Siphiwe Nyanda and former MK members Bheki Cele, Thenjiwe Mtintso and Thabang Makwetla.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
