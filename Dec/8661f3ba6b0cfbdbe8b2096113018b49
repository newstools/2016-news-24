The City's head of water and sanitation, Ednick Msweli, presented a report outlining a pilot project and the cost implications to the executive committee on Tuesday.Msweli said the City intended erecting 12 boreholes in areas most affected by the drought.He said the drought situation was still dire, with major dams still sitting below 50% capacity. "We are still in the grip of the drought. Only Hazelmere Dam is performing well presently. However, its capacity cannot exceed 70%, as a section of the dam wall is being repaired."The boreholes would cost R450 000 each. The cost to council would be R5.4m for 12 containerised plants, with an additional R600 000 for the drilling of the boreholes.Msweli said the cost of a&nbsp;litre of water produced from the boreholes would be considerably less than what the City paid bulk water supplier Umgeni Water.Made in South AfricaIn the first year, an estimated 43 800 000 litres of water would be produced at a cost of R0.14 per litre from the project. Within five years, 219 000 000 litres would be produced, costing R0.03 per litre. In 10 years, it is anticipated that&nbsp;438 000 000 litres of water would be produced at a cost of R0.01 per litre, he said.Msweli added that water generating&nbsp;stations&nbsp;would provide 500 people with 20 litres of safe drinking water every day, for life."The stations are low-maintenance, requiring maintenance only annually. They are portable, solar-powered [at a cost of] 2.5 cents per litre for 10 years."He said the stations are designed, produced and patented in South Africa. Msweli added that benefits to the initiative included a quick turnaround time to secure safe water in communities.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
