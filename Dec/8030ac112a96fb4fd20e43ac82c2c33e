Final arguments would be heard on January 19.TimelinesThe defence has drawn on timelines and places the&nbsp;accuser&nbsp;can remember and has researched recorded events and the construction of buildings as part of its efforts to verify or disprove statements.During the last court appearance, Baron's friend, retired fellow pastor Samuel Michaels, 66, denied events that were put to him.Prosecutor Dercia Rabie read from the accuser's statement, in which she said Michaels would remember what happened.&ldquo;I told the big people about it when I was a child,&rdquo; Rabie read.&ldquo;When I began with the case, I found out how much people can lie. I found out that pastors can lie to you. Michaels is lying.&rdquo;But Michaels denied he had known about what happened.&ldquo;Nobody told me about it until a case was lodged with the police,&rdquo; he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
