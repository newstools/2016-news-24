that justice would be served in the murder of Sundumbili chief Linda Mathonsi. He made this assurance, and announced a special task team
had been set up to probe the murder, while visiting the slain chief's family. Mathonsi was gunned down in front of his daughter while in
their car outside the Sundumbili library on Monday evening. His daughter and
their bodyguard were wounded in the hail of bullets. Heavily armed police officers flanked Ntlemeza during his
visit to the mourning family. He said he had personally assembled a task team to
investigate the killing. "I am calling on those responsible to hand themselves
over. I don't want to put any effort into having to find you," he said. "We have formulated a task team comprising of members
of the DPCI (Hawks), the KZN police and other people that I won't even
mention." Ntlemeza said Mathonsi's family had said they were worried about
further attacks. He said police in the area were working on a solution to
ensure their safety. Ntlemeza's brief address to the media preceded a visit to
the crime scene. Chalk outlines of where bullet cartridges had been were still
visible on the road. Ntlemeza faces his own woes. The Helen Suzman Foundation and
Freedom Under Law have asked the High Court in Pretoria to set aside his
appointment and declare it irrational.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
