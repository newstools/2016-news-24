"Large-scale attacks could start at any moment."Russian Deputy Ambassador Petr Iliichev cast doubt over warnings of a risk of genocide, arguing that criminal groups and "undisciplined" troops were responsible for mass violence, and not the government's policy.There is growing alarm over the humanitarian crisis in the country as the conflict enters its fourth year.More than 6 million people - half of South Sudan's population - are in need of urgent aid and humanitarian organisations expect this number to rise by 20 to 30% next year.Some 1.3 million South Sudanese have fled across borders as refugees, including 383 000 who have fled to Uganda since July, according to UN figures.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
