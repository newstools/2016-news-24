'Reign of terror'Ahmed said the first lady was aware that his business had already incurred the costs of preparing the diamond for its sale.To avoid trouble the businessman offered to repay the money in instalments and has paid back $150 000 already, he said in court documents. He also claimed that Grace, together with her son, initiated "a reign of terror and harassment where I was verbally threatened, harassed, insulted and told that I could not do anything to them as they are in fact 'Zimbabwe'"."Threats of taking over my properties in Zimbabwe were also made," he added.
