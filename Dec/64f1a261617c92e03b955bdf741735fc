Some braved the sometimes wet and chilly weather to join bank queues at night in order to increase their chances of accessing the limited amounts being offered to depositors by financial institutions.&nbsp;RBZ governor John Mangudya on Tuesday reportedly doubled the withdrawal limit of bond notes to $100 per day and introduced $12m more of the surrogate currency to "smoothen transactions during the festive season".But, bank officials said they awaited official communication from the RBZ boss.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
