It said the outcome of the municipal polls had put it at the centre of electoral revival. "It is the EFF which has restored conscience in the heart of our politics; where it is now evident, more than ever, that without respecting the will of the people, even century old liberation movements can fall," the party said.It thanked its members for working tirelessly during the campaign, which it described as the longest, as well as its supporters.The EFF also wished South Africans and the continent a "revolutionary new year"."We call on all who will be travelling over this time to do so responsibly and not to drink and drive. We call on young people to practice safe sex and not to abuse alcohol and drugs. We also call on all parents to take extra care of children amidst all the festivities; let no child be lost in this season, let the whole community be on guard against child neglect."&ldquo;We wish you all a 2017 full of peace, social justice, equality and economic freedom in our lifetime,&rdquo; the party said.#EFF: The EFF claims 2016 as the most important political year in South Africa's democratic history since 1994.
