I hope this marks the end of the use of blockade tactics in our country," he added."This is a very significant event, which will help restore our economy. We will add 175 000 barrels per day to national production within one month and 270,000 bpd within three months."Libya currently produces around 600 000 bpd, and seeks to double this next year, especially since the reopening of terminals in the east of the chaos-ridden country that had also been blockaded.The NOC said the reopening at Rayayina "will add $4.5bn to our projected revenue next year" at current crude prices.Al-Sharara, around 800km southwest of Tripoli, is a joint venture oilfield operated by the NOC and a consortium of Spain's Repsol, Total (France), OMV (Austria) and Statoil (Norway).Al-Feel, farther south some 200 kilometres from Sebha, is run jointly by the NOC and Italy's ENI.Before the fall in 2011 of Muammar Gaddafi, Libya produced 1.6 million bpd.But since then, the country has been gripped by political and security chaos, unable to exploit or profit fully from its enormous oil resources and pushing the economy to the brink of collapse. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
