This election is going to consolidate that democracy further," he said.Asked to comment on allegations of corruption, he said "there is a general perception of corruption in all African countries. I think it is a stage of our development."As we continue to strengthen the institutions of state, I think that people will come to see the integrity in these institutions."Results are expected from late on Thursday in a tight presidential race in which Mahama's popularity has been chipped away by criticism from his main rival, veteran politician Nana Akufo-Addo, over sluggish economic growth and high-profile corruption.An exporter of gold, cocoa and oil, Ghana was once hailed as a regional growth model but in 2015 had to go to the International Monetary Fund for a bailout.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
