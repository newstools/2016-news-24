She initially claimed that the men had broken into Mitha&rsquo;s Vorna Valley home.The plot to rob and kill Mitha was revealed in a confession Zwakala later made to investigators.In her original statement to police, Zwakala said three men knocked on Mitha&rsquo;s door on December 10. She said they came into the home and she heard Mitha scream.When she tried to help Mitha, one of the men allegedly grabbed her, took her to a bedroom, tied her up and stuffed a plastic bag into her mouth to keep her quiet, IOL reported.Mitha&rsquo;s screams stopped, and after the men left, Zwakala shuffled out of the room and called for help.Zwakala later led police to a home in Ivory Park, on Gauteng&rsquo;s East Rand, where police found laptops stolen during the murder.The firearm stolen during the attack was found in the shack Zwakala and her boyfriend, Mashego, shared.The other three were arrested in Gauteng, Limpopo and Mpumalanga in March 2015.The family thanked police and the media for how they handed the case.Ismail said Van Veenendaal delivered a detailed and comprehensive judgment.&ldquo;We commend her for sending a strong message that these kind of crimes are not the norm which society needs to live in.&rdquo; &nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
