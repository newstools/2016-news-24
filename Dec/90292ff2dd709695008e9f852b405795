Whoever is coming into the next board, it will be an issue which has to be taken into account."Mavuso said the CEO, CFO and COO were the only positions that required the minister's approval.All the SABC's other group executives were appointed by the board according to the Broadcasting Act.Ping pong, musical chairsHe said the results of Muthambi's amendment were that the SABC's group executive appointments become like a game of ping pong or musical chairs."What has been the practice is people have appointed from within. We never saw an advert."It may have been internally [promoted], but never external."He said it required certain political muscle to resolve this issue.ANC MP Fezeka Loliwe was asked why he did not quit sooner during his three-year stay as a board member, given his seemingly principled character."Honourable member, I'm not a quitter. I believe in fighting until sanity prevails."But in this instance, I think I became insane as well. It reached a point where it was just too much."Mavuso resigned publicly from the board on October 5, along with Krish Naidoo, during a sitting of Parliament's portfolio committee on communications.The committee meanwhile will interview Naidoo, former acting GCEO Phill Molefe and former group executive for risk and governance Itani Tseisi on Friday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
