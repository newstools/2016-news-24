I have directed the police to do everything within their powers to bring to justice those responsible for this callous deed.&ldquo;What is most shocking and disturbing is that these killings appear to be systematic and well-orchestrated. We urge members of the community to work with the police to ensure that the assassins are brought to book soonest,&rdquo; urged Kaunda. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
