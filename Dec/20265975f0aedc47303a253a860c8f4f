She said education was the safer way to gain material goods."These elderly men are the ones who are spreading this incurable disease. You must learn to say no to them, and focus on your education so that you can buy yourself Carvela shoes and a KFC Streetwise Two. Blessers and blessees must fall," said Ramathuba.She also urged young men to get tested for HIV/AIDS because they are dying from denial."Most young men are dying because of this incurable disease because they are afraid to go for testing and they are in denial as soon as they find out that they have it."False prophets, traditional healersShe also took a swipe at false prophets, pastors and traditional healers who claim that they can heal HIV/AIDS."You must stay away from these false prophets and traditional healers who claim that they can heal this incurable disease. As far as we know there has been no cure for HIV/AIDS but it can be treated [with] ARVs," said Ramathuba.She said HIV infection in the province, at 1.5%, was low compared to other provinces."I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate people who are living with HIV in the province for taking their treatment, because the spread of the HIV in the province is very low compared to other provinces," she said.Limpopo AIDS Council Deputy Chairperson, Makhomisani Mlambo urged people to go for testing and lambasted health workers for spreading rumours."Health workers in our clinics and hospitals, you must stop going around talking about other people's status in our communities. This leads to people being stigmatised, and some being afraid to be tested," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
