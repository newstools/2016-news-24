I thought they were looking for their mother," he added."She headed toward the poultry sellers, and then detonated her explosives belt."The attack was not immediately claimed by Boko Haram but bore all the hallmarks of the jihadists, who have regularly used women and young girls to carry out suicide attacks in their seven-year insurgent campaign in the troubled region. On Friday at least 45 people died and 33 others were wounded in another double suicide attack carried out by female bombers in the northeast.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
