One of their mothers reported the two to police in October.The judge in Marrakech ruled Friday that the girls must remain under parental authority until they turn 18.Their defense lawyer, Rachid El Ghorfi, expressed relief at the acquittal. Ghorfi says, "They should have never been in front of the prosecutor or the judge."Women and girls rarely are charged under Morocco's law prohibiting homosexual activity.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
