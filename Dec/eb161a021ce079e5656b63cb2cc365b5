The test assesses the ability of an applicant's family to fund the student&rsquo;s studies.Students can qualify for varying amounts up to the maximum of R71 800 a year for a university student. This includes full tuition fees, accommodation, meals, books and travel, the Nsfas website says. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
