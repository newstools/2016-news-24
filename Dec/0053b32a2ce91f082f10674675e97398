But that round will be limited as DRC's bishops will leave on Saturday for a long-planned visit to see Pope Francis.The main sticking point in any future deal is the political fate of Kabila, who true to his reputation as a man of few words, has not announced his plans.A democratic handover would break ground for DRC's 70 million people who since independence from Belgium in 1960 have never witnessed political change at the ballot box.And in the last few years hundreds of people have died in political violence in the capital, Kinshasa, and elsewhere.Tshisekedi and his allies had threatened nationwide protests from Monday to press Kabila to step down, but have opted to hold off pending the negotiations."If we win guarantees (on an election date and a pledge that Kabila will not seek a new mandate) we will speak to the people because the challenge begins from December 19," Jean-Marc Kabund, the secretary-general of Tshisekedi's party, told AFP.The government for its part has ordered that social networks including Facebook and WhatsApp be blocked from 23:59 on Sunday.Police said they were setting up checkpoints in large Congolese cities to "discourage criminal intentions that have started to take on worrying dimensions".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
