When he died, the relief was no longer necessary.Proper regulatory frameworkIt said there was evidence to suggest he had changed his mind about wanting an assisted death.The high court judge was not told about the change in his condition or his doubts.According to the SCA, the high court&rsquo;s notion of a dignified death was not informed by a rounded view of society."It [a court] needs to consider the impact of its decision beyond our affluent suburbs into our crowded townships, our informal settlements, and in the vast rural areas that make up South Africa."Should assisted suicide ever be allowed in the country, there would need to be a proper regulatory framework.Dignity SA, the organisation which helped Stransham-Ford bring his application to the high court, extended its love and thoughts to his family on Tuesday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
