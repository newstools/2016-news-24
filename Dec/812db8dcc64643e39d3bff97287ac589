Jeff Wicks, News24Richards Bay - A police hostage negotiator managed to&nbsp;convince a man to climb down from the tower of a crane where it was previously thought that a person was being held hostage on Monday. However, it later turned out that there was only one person in the crane.Earlier paramedics had been on standby at Richards Bay, Lira Link, where it was at first thought that&nbsp;two people&nbsp;were barricaded in the tower of a crane at a construction site. IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson Paul Herbst confirmed that medics had been on high alert after initial&nbsp;reports surfaced of a suspected hostage drama in progress, six storeys above ground. Herbst said a police negotiator had arrived at the scene and attempted to initiate contact with the person that was, at the time, believed to be the hostage taker. Information given to the medics at that&nbsp;stage was that two people were barricaded in the control module of the crane. Herbst said it then emerged that only one man was inside the crane and after an exchange of words with the negotiator, he was convinced to climb down. The man was taken into custody.#hostage - from the scene: negotiators convinced a man to leave the crane tower.
