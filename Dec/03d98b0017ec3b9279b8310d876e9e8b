Nyanda also highlighted that there was little time left in order to achieve this goal before the 2017 elective conference, where Zuma will step down as leader of the party."If we do not succeed, the dreams we dared to dream will become nightmares. Those who died so we may be free have died in vain," he told guests.He also hit out at those who had claimed there was a sinister motive behind the gathering, saying it was not true. He said it was a well thought out idea, aimed only at trying to help the ANC find ways to address its challenges."We are not here to discuss Kebby, not here to discuss the president, this or that person. We are here to discuss issues."On Thursday, treasurer general in the MKMVA Des Van Rooyen, at the 55th anniversary of the ANC liberation army seemed to hit out at the former commanders, telling those gathered at the event that there was only one MKMVA that was recognised by the ANC.Nyanda said an invitation to their event was sent out to leaders of the MKMVA. The military association&rsquo;s leaders will come under discussion throughout the day as leaders attempt to analyse whether or not it has fulfilled its role in looking after the welfare of former combatants."We do know that some leaders of some factions, who wanted to preserve their influence and interests, are mobilising resources to subvert internal democracy and corrupt branches of the ANC."We may therefore be ignored and our efforts resisted and subverted, he said.The former minister also said if this was the case then the ANC would surely die. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
