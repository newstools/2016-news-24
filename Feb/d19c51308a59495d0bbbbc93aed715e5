A man ran to the department of health's Emergency Medical Services (EMS) base in the early hours of the morning asking for help, KZN spokesperson Robert Mckenzie said. Paramedics rushed to the scene and heard the baby moving and crying inside the 3m-deep pit in the Sdakeni area of Masinga. They used a crowbar and large rocks to break the concrete base of the toilet open and plucked the baby out. Mckenzie said the baby was very cold and soiled, but was cleaned, warmed and taken to hospital. She was reported to be recovering well. He described the man who alerted them as "the good guy" in the situation, but did not want to go into the details of how the baby came to be in the pit. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
