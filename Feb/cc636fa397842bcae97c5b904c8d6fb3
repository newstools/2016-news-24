Cape Town - Three men arrested for suspected bank card cloning and being in possession of illegal point of sale (POS) devices will remain in custody after appearing the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court on Monday. Hawks spokesperson Lieutenant Robert Netshiunda in a statement said the trio were arrested on Friday. Malawian Diamond Thengeza, 26, was arrested at a restaurant in Canal Walk after several complaints were received from customers whose bank cards were allegedly cloned after they had swiped at the eatery, he said. "An illegal POS device was found at the business premises, while another two devices were found at his house," he said. "Further investigation led the Hawks to Thengeza’s countryman Clarksen Gwazeni, 24, who was also arrested after an illegal POS device, two laptops and two cloned bank cards were found at his flat in Parklands, Tableview." Mzwandile Khumalo, 31, was also arrested at his flat in Kuils River after he was found with four cloned bank cards, as well as two laptops and two POS devices, Netshiunda said. Thengeza will make a formal bail application next Tuesday while Gwazeni and Khumalo will apply on Thursday.
