	     Burgersfort - A platinum miner in Limpopo was killed
after the brakes failed on a utility vehicle she was in at the Atlatsa
Resources Bokoni mine near Burgersfort.  This is the second death at the mine in 30 days.  Ramadimetja Degrecia Phaladi died at the Brakfontein
shaft earlier in the week. The mine said her colleague, Topase Suzan Bhembe,
was injured and was in a critical but stable condition in hospital. "Whilst the investigation is ongoing, all operations
related to the use of trackless equipment at the Brakfontein shaft have been
suspended," Atlatsa Resources spokesperson Prudence Lebina
said. "The Atlatsa board of directors and management extend their condolences to
Ms Phaladi's family and friends." The death has prompted the National Union of Mineworkers
(NUM) to call for a speedy investigation and improvement in mine safety. NUM branch chairperson Thapelo Madintsi told News24 on
Friday that they were shocked by the accident. "We are very concerned about the fatal accident in
the mine - it is the second incident within a month," said Madintsi. "It is very disturbing... when workers go
underground, we expect them to return to their families, not to perish." The mine said on January 14 that Kganki Nicholas
Kupa, a scraper winch operator at the Brakfontein shaft, had died while
underground.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
