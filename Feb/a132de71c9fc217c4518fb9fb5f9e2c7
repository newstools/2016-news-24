Pietermaritzburg - Police believe they have arrested another member of a gang behind more than a dozen business and residential burglaries and thefts out of motor vehicles in the northern suburbs. This comes a week after another gang member, with the alias “Marble Eye”, was arrested. The alleged mastermind, who also has a glass eye like the gang’s ringleader, has been dubbed by police who arrested him as “Marble Eye Two”. On January 27, The Witness reported that gang leader Marble Eye and two accomplices in a seven-man gang who terrorised home and business owners in the northern suburbs were arrested by the Combined Action Team (CAT), with alleged links to more than a dozen cases in the area. Following up on information about the gang, CAT members arrested the alleged mastermind, Marble Eye Two, during the early hours of yesterday morning. It is believed the man and an accomplice had broken into a local church and were fleeing with the goods when they were nabbed. The accomplice managed to escape but R85 000 worth of music instruments, sound equipment and clothes were recovered from Marble Eye Two after he was tackled by a police dog near the Khan Road informal settlement in Raisethorpe. According to a police source, footage from five shop owners reveal both Marble Eye and Marble Eye Two burgling the premises. It is believed the gang members live in the Malahleni area and on the night of their crimes had walked to the northern suburbs at about 8 pm. The gang then allegedly monitors police presence in their target areas before breaking into homes and businesses between 2 am and 4 am. The suspects are expected to appear in court soon.
