Amanda Khoza, News24 Durban &ndash; The property of alleged Pietermaritzburg drug syndicate kingpin Joyce Komane was expected to go under the hammer on Tuesday morning, the NPA said. The Asset Forfeiture Unit would auction Komane&rsquo;s properties after the Pietermaritzburg High Court ruled in August 2013 that the properties were funded by proceeds from drug dealing between 1996 and 2005, KwaZulu-Natal National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Natasha Kara said. The auction was expected to begin at a property on Carey Road, Westgate, at 09:30. This would be followed by four more properties &ndash; one in Bisley, two on Jabu Ndlovu Street, and one in Northdale. The Witness reported that Komane was arrested in 2005 and faced trial, along with Ramjini Chetty - a woman known as Pietermaritzburg&rsquo;s "drug queen" - and others. They were charged with racketeering and dealing in cocaine and Mandrax. Komane was convicted of drug dealing, forgery and money laundering, and sentenced to 18 years in prison. This was overturned on appeal in 2010.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
