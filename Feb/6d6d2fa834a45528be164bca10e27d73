One was Patel&rsquo;s domestic worker and the other was employed in his store.Both had left the programme because they were not comfortable with it, and without the investigating officer&rsquo;s knowledge.Mudau asked for the trial to be postponed until the witnesses were found.Patel was arrested in April last year after he was linked to the murder of his wife Fatima. She was beaten, strangled and shot in the couple's rented apartment in Nirvana, Polokwane.Defence lawyer Tumi Mokoena objected to the postponement, arguing that it would prejudice his client.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
