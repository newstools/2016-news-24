The aircraft, which had been leased to a British firm by US-based Western Global Airlines, has now been impounded together with its consignment, said to consist of millions in freshly-minted South African rand notes on their way from Munich, Germany, to Durban in KwaZulu-Natal for the South African Reserve Bank.Zimbabwean officials removed the body of the man from the plane on Monday, placing it inside a metal coffin that was hoisted up to an opening in the plane&rsquo;s fuselage, according to a picture published in the private NewsDay.A post-mortem was now being carried out "to establish whether the body is not carrying viruses that may cause the spread of diseases here", the Herald reported.Earlier reports said that ground staff at Harare International Airport had been alerted to the presence of the body on Sunday by blood dripping from the plane&rsquo;s air conditioning vault.The Herald suggested that what had been initially thought to be blood may in fact have been other fluids from the decomposing corpse.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
