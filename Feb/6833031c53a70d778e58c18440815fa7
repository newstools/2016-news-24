Extraordinarily, the desert sand has preserved the plant fibre battens which covered the planking seams," it said."It is by all means a remarkable discovery," Barta said."The careful excavation and recording of the Abusir boat will make a considerable contribution to our understanding of ancient Egyptian watercraft and their place in funerary cult."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
