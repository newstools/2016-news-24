the lives of two people in Utrecht in December 2012 was shown during the trial
of men accused of the murder. Brandishing firearms and wearing balalclavas, the two
alleged bombers were photographed robbing two garage staff just before the
garage's ATM machine was destroyed and two passing motorists were shot dead. The Pietermaritzburg High Court was shown CCTV footage
of the men holding up garage staff at 02:00 and stealing R1 900 from them. Two people travelling to work, Bongakuhle Nkosi and Sizwe
Gule, were mowed down in a fusillade of AK47 bullets as they passed the scene
of the blast. The ATM machine was blown 30 metres from its
installation. The owner of the building, Heidi Rohrs, told the court that
the robbers took R115 000 from the ATM and that damage to the building had cost
about R100 000 to repair. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
