Once on the beach the man was found to be unconscious and suffering signs and symptoms of a non-fatal drowning," Lambinon added.The man, in a critical condition, was treated on the beach, before being rushed to hospital by ambulance."It appears that the [man] had been at the beach with his wife and two children - they are on holiday from Blaufelden, Germany - when the man was caught in rip currents."A surfer, Jean Bezuidenhout, had noticed the man in difficulty and he had paddled his surfboard through the surf and on reaching the man successfully rescuing him," Lambinon said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
