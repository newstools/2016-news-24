No human body parts can be used to make muthi,&rdquo; THO national co-ordinator Temangcamane Maseko said. The THO made the remarks following the court appearance of two sangomas implicated in the disappearance of 3-year-old Leticia Nkentjane in Boschfontein, Mpumalanga, on October 30 2015.&nbsp;Her body had still not been found.The Nelspruit Regional Court recently heard that the two sangomas, Jabulani Ndlovu, 27, and Themba Mnyambo, 43, both from Boschfontein, used the girl&rsquo;s body for muthi."These people, if it really happened, are not our members," said Maseko. They were arrested with four other people on November 23 last year after being suspected of kidnapping the girl. During their bail application, the two sangomas distanced themselves from the allegations. The application was continuing on Friday.Their four co-accused did not apply for bail as they feared for their lives.Another accused, Bongane Ngomane, had turned State witness. He told police he wanted to clear his conscience after the two sangomas threatened him not to talk while he was in custody.&nbsp;He had been taken to a place of safety and was under police guard. Boschfontein residents and the girl&rsquo;s family had asked prosecutor Toby Stein to ask the sangomas for Leticia&rsquo;s remains, so they could bury her. Stein said the two accused were not willing to say anything. Tonga police spokesperson Lieutenant Mzwandile Nyambi said they were still searching for the body. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
