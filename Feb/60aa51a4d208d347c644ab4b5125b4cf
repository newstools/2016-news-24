welcomed President Jacob Zuma's proposal that Parliament should consider
relocating to Pretoria. In his State of the Nation Address on Thursday, Zuma said that
a lot of money would be saved if Parliament was moved. This would cut the costs of hotels, cars and flights, he
said. ANC chief whip Stone Sizani’s office welcomed Zuma’s
"bold statement". "The existence of two capitals, Pretoria as the seat of
government and Cape Town as the seat of Parliament, is an unsustainable,
onerously expensive and indefensible arrangement which was intended to serve
the narrow interests of the colonial rulers and must be corrected without
delay," spokesperson Moloto Mothapo said in a statement. He said there was no doubt that moving Parliament would save
millions of rands, which could be channelled towards service delivery. "The time that is wasted on travel between the two
capitals by MPs, ministers, government staff and officials of state-owned
enterprises could be directed towards boosting productivity," the party
said. The ANC said they were confident that Zuma’s view would be
seriously considered by parties in Parliament. The Economic Freedom Fighters have already come out in
support of the move, though they said it was unlikely to happen during Zuma’s
term in office. The party also called for the move not to be used as a
money-making scheme. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
