Durban - A 5-month-old boy who was left unattended, died in
a shack fire in KwaMashu on Sunday, KwaZulu-Natal Social Development MEC Weziwe
Thusi said on Wednesday. Thusi said the child's mother was reportedly out running
errands and his father was visiting friends when the shack caught fire. "I am upset that a child has died in such a horrible
manner, but I am also angry that in 2016 there are parents who see nothing
wrong with leaving an infant alone. "We have been preaching child protection for years and
that children cannot be left alone for a split second, but clearly our messages
did not reach this family and that is why we are talking about this tragedy
today." She urged parents and caregivers to take responsibility for
looking after children very seriously. "I have asked our social workers to visit the family
and offer assistance. I am hoping that this will be the last time that I send
social workers to attend to anything similar to this."
