Mpho Raborife, News24"Planet Zuma is a place in a parallel universe, far, far away from the lives of ordinary South Africans," - so says DA leader Mmusi Maimane in Parliament. Watch.WATCHJohannesburg -&nbsp;During the State of the Nation Address debate on Tuesday afternoon, DA leader Mmusi Maimane cited the Star Wars prologue, saying President Jacob Zuma lived in a galaxy far, far away, on "Planet Zuma".Following the debate in the National Assembly, South Africans uploaded creative memes on Twitter, poking fun at Maimane's comments, accompanied by tweets with their views.Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula said Maimane was probably on a PlanetFitness Treadmill doing cardio when he thought of this "Planet Zuma"."What a joke," he commented.Communications expert Khaya Dlanga posted a picture of Jupiter with the caption: "Planet Zuma, the recently discovered planet on our solar system, discovered by Maimane. #SONAdebate."Comedian Loyiso Gola sounded more upbeat, tweeting "#planetzuma would be dooooope thou". Political analyst and social commentator Eusebius McKaiser, who seemed to agree with Maimane, said "#PlanetZuma really is a good rhetorical refrain. Sadly the president indeed lives in a parallel universe. At our expense. Tragicomedy stuff."Former Congress of South African Trade Unions general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi said: "Wow - new one from the box #PlanetZuma in the #SONAdebate".Mmusi Maimane &amp; this Planet Zuma analogy pic.twitter.com/Ev7oxwOMmM&mdash; S L A Y O N C &Egrave; (@AyandaMlotshwa) February 16, 2016From broken man to Planet Zuma.
