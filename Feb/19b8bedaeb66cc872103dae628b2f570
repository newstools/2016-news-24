Musa slit Balanga's throat on April 15, 2015, accusing the journalist of broadcasting news that his father Jean-Pierre Soma Pendeli Domaro was to be replaced in his hospital supervisor's post.Judicial authorities arrested five people after the murder and put them on trial. Boto said he was "disappointed by this verdict", which acquitted Musa's father and a former doctor at the hospital, Charles Tete Ndjeka, along with two others.According to the lawyer, Pendeli Domaro and Ndjeka were "morally responsible for the murder"."We plan to appeal," Boto added.Press freedom group OLPA, a Congolese non-governmental organisation, welcomed Musa's conviction. "This is a strong signal to anybody who threatens the life of a journalist and who is tempted to believe that they will enjoy impunity," OLPA executive secretary Joseph Alain Kabongo told AFP.In April last year, international watchdogReporters Without Borders (RSF) denounced Balanga's murder and stated that deadly attacks on journalists in the DRC were rarely investigated.In 2013 and 2014, "60 journalists were beaten or threatened" in the vast central African country, according to RSF.The DRC stood in 150th place out of 180 in the global press freedom ratings released by RSF for 2015.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
