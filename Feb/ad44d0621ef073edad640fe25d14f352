New York - A New York native fell victim to a not-so-Good Samaritan, after receiving a note informing him that his lost wallet had been found, but the finder would be keeping the cash to “buy weed”. Reilly Flaherty uploaded the anonymous note he received on Tuesday to Instagram, after losing his wallet a week earlier at a gig in New York. In the note, the anonymous person told Flaherty he had found his wallet, but would be keeping the cash to buy marijuana, as well as his subway metro card because “the fare’s $2.75 now”. The anonymous note-sender also kept the wallet because "it's kinda cool", but returned Flaherty's credit cards and driver’s licence. “To be honest, I was thinking this person is the Walter White of wallet returning,” Flaherty told US-based website Mashable, comparing the sender to the popular Breaking Bad character. “They start out with seemingly good intentions, but then you quickly realise they’re actually just a villain plagued with an insatiable appetite for MetroCard spending and marijuana-infused subway rides, hurting everyone they love around them.” At least the perpetrator had enough manners to say “toodles”.  thanks..
