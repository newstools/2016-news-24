In a statement released on Tuesday, the KFCB said the video promoted same sex marriage, a practice it claimed was contrary to the Kenyan constitution. Homosexuality is illegal in Kenya. A report by The Star indicated that that Art Attack did not obtain appropriate license to distribute the video, with the KFCB chair asking Kenyans not to allow such content to turn the country into modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah. Distribution and exhibition of inappropriate content that is likely to "corrupt" moral values of youth and children is also illegal and attracts a sentence of two years in prison. KFCB said the Board had already written to Google asking them to block the video from streaming in Kenya. However, the Google Kenya communications manager Dorothy Ooko told Business Daily that they had not yet received such a request but encouraged Kenyans to flag any content they deemed inappropriate.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
