THE annual SPAR River Mile Festival is once again set to anchor Nelson Mandela Bay s vast water sports calendar this month.The 92nd River Mile, which takes place on the Sundays River at Cannonville just outside Port Elizabeth on February 20 and 21, traditionally welcomes thousands of open-water swimmers and supporters to its shores.Race director Michael Zoetmulder of Zsports said that although the event was a staple for local swimmers, it had shown tremendous growth over the past decade. Ten years ago the race drew just over 500 entrants and in 2014 it topped out at 1 600. He said the extended two-day programme which culminates in the SPAR Ladies and Men s Miles offered events for swimmers of all ages and ability. Children 12 years and under can enter the Kids Across the River races and our veterans do well into their eighties. Apart from the swimming other disciplines included the 5km Wimpy Family Run and the 10 and 30km Oracle Media mountain bike events. We recognise the need for family activities in PE and, as such, provide a variety of events during the festival, said Zoetmulder. It also allows us to offer a triathlon component. The River Mile supports the Smile Foundation and Cleft Friends through raising awareness and collecting donations.The News Caf PE Disabled Mile and the Wakaberry Kids Across the River races, which feature a special needs category, cater for swimmers with disabilities.The Wimpy Rotary Kids Zone, Castle Beer Tent and stalls will provide festivalgoers with plenty to do and see.Zoetmulder said they had selected an assortment of food vendors as well as craft and general stalls ranging from swimwear to art. Gates open at 08:00 daily and entry is R20 per person. Enter at www.rivermile.co.za or find SPAR EC in Action on Facebook for more information.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
