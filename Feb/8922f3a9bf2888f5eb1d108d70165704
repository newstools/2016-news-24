The war veterans made the call after Kasukuwere vowed to thwart their plan to bar Moyo from attending the politburo meeting.They accused Moyo of fanning factionalism within the ruling party, following a number comments on his Twitter page in which he attacked fellow cabinet ministers, politburo members and journalists.According to News Day, Zhuwao described the threats by the war veterans as a direct attack on Mugabe, who he said had called the politburo meeting. "&hellip; It is highly disrespectful to even attempt to then bar members of the politburo from attending a meeting that has been called for by the president and First Secretary of the party. "It is the president of the party, who is the appointing authority and, therefore, any attempt to then turn around and say that you will not allow someone to attend a meeting they have been invited to attend by the appointing authority is tantamount to usurping the powers of that same appointing authority," Zhuwao was quoted as saying. Meanwhile, according to the state owned Herald newspaper, Zhuwao denied having a working agreement with the troubled war veterans minister. He told the publication that there was no "modus vivendi" with Mutsvangwa. "I wish to correct an impression created by Chris Mutsvangwa wherein he indicated he has a modus Vivendi with Kasukuwere and Zhuwao, I wish to state that I have not agreed to disagree with Chris Mutsvangwa, especially in light of his stated cordial relations with the EU which has imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe and still maintains them," Zhuwao said.&nbsp; According to reports, Zhuwao, Kasukuwere, Moyo are all members of the Generation 40 (G40) faction which is opposed to Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa becoming president of Zimbabwe.The G40 is, instead, pushing for Grace Mugabe to succeed her 91-year-old husband, should anything happen to him while in office.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
