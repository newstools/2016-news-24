@Jeranji Sheraton residents who started a school crossing patrol are upping their effort following the robbery of three pupils of Steenberg High School on Friday. The pupils, aged between 14 to 15 years, had their money and a cellphone stolen. The residents started a crossing guard after their numerous requests to the local ward councillor to have extra safety measures on Military Road did not achieve anything. They decided to step up and do it themselves (“Locals jump in at road”, People’s Post, 2 February). Now the residents will be going a step further to make sure that Military Road, which has also been noted as a hotspot for robberies, is kept under watch. They say robbers get away easily because of the busy road and they want to put a stop to that. Beatrice Twigg of the Sheraton Park neighbourhood watch says the pupils’ recent ordeal is even more reason to step up their patrol. “There are drug dealers who sell drugs hidden in the bushes. Our children have become targets. We will be upping our patrol as well to make sure that that spot is free of crime,” she says. Twigg adds they will continue with the crossing patrol to ensure the safety of pupils going to and from school. “We want to make sure that they get home safe and they go to school safe as well. We are really prioritising their safety and we hope that those in authority will see the importance of having safety measures, especially around this area where it’s so difficult to cross,” says Twigg.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
