All the government schools have obtained above 70%, but the private schools are the ones that are bringing us down," she said.Mhaule was addressing teachers, Grade 12 pupils, councillors and other role players during the Mbombela local municipality&rsquo;s excellence awards on Friday evening. "You have your Hazyview Private College. Of course they will say they are better, but we do not expect private schools to obtain less than 70%, especially when all the government school have obtained more than 70%."Hazyview Private College has obtained 69%; we are not happy. Twin College are in 68%. It is worse with Royal College because they are at 59%; they are below 60% while Elephant College is at 55%," said Mhaule.Mhaule said although private schools were independent from the government, they still needed intervention."You cannot throw them away and say these are private schools. They are our learners; our children are in those schools and we must support them and in the end they have a bearing in the overall results of the province," Mhaule said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
