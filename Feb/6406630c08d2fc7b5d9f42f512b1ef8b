The attacker then ransacked the church, ripped the cross off the tabernacle, and made a hole in the roof.A badly-injured Prince managed to call a priest for help.&ldquo;We condemn this behaviour, which again shows our vulnerability to crazed people, especially in our poorer communities,&rdquo; Pearson said.Provincial police spokesperson Constable Noloyiso Rwexana said the attack was being investigated and no arrests had been made yet.Despite his ordeal, Pearson said Prince was in &ldquo;high spirits&rdquo;. He was living on another of the church&rsquo;s properties to be closer to hospital, where he was receiving treatment.Pearson said they would re-examine the security of the property as it was not as good as they had thought. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
