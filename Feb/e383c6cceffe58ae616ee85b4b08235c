The National Freedom Party&rsquo;s Vikizitha Mlotshwa said there was nothing new in Mchunu&rsquo;s address.&nbsp;&ldquo;It is more or less the same as last year's speech. The premier failed to properly address the issue education,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;He said he would monitor closely that the department does not decline but he has not dealt with education MEC Peggy Nkonyeni and we are not satisfied by that.&rdquo; Mlotshwa said Nkonyeni had failed to solve problems affecting schools in the province.&nbsp;&ldquo;We are calling the premier to reshuffle his cabinet. MEC Nkonyeni is not fit for this portfolio.&rdquo;Mlotshwa also criticised the department of agriculture.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes rural communities have been given tractors and cattle but they are not monitored.&rdquo;Similar speech to GordhanBlessed Gwala from the IFP said Mchunu&rsquo;s speech was similar to the one Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan delivered on Wednesday night. &ldquo;They come up with very good programmes but will they be implemented? They are just massaging the hearts and minds of voters ahead of the local government elections,&rdquo; he said.Gwala said he was waiting to see what would happen after the elections.&nbsp;&ldquo;Everything will go up including taxes, they are just saying what people want to hear for now,&rdquo; he said.The DA&rsquo;s Zwakele Mncwango said the premier presented &ldquo;a wish list.&rdquo;&ldquo;He failed dismally to touch on the issue of the drought and how the province would be dealing with the crisis&hellip;&nbsp;He did not deal with issues affecting education&hellip; he just left it to the MEC to elaborate on how she would deal with the failure rate.&rdquo;Mncwango said Mchunu failed to take leadership on the issue.Implementation of projectsVukani Ndlovu of the EFF said the party was concerned about the implementation of projects.&nbsp;&ldquo;The change in leadership [in the province] has had a serious impact on some of the things that need to be implemented," he said.&ldquo;We know that soon there will be a change in leadership and we will see some of the projects not been completed,&rdquo; he said speaking about the upcoming local elections. Ndlovu commended the government for making attempts to collect money owed to the National Student Financial Aid Scheme by its officials. &ldquo;I think it was a fair speech but we are not happy with how corruption is being handled by the provincial government,&rdquo; he said.
