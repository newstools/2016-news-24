murder of Cape Town metro police officer Ben Koopman has been released, deputy metro
police chief Yolande Faro said on Sunday. “The City of Cape Town’s Special Investigations Unit, who is
working with police and the Hawks on the case, were on scene when the suspect
was arrested in the early hours of Saturday,” she said. “He has since been released due to a lack of evidence.” This follows the release of two men arrested in Kleinvlei on
Wednesday, also due to insufficient evidence. Koopman, 53, was gunned down while on duty on Monday after
having lunch at his Eerste River home. His wife Katriena on Thursday told News24 her son had seen
his father being killed. This after his two attackers greeted Koopman before
accosting him and firing the fatal shot. His service pistol and radio were stolen. Faro said while they were disappointed that no one was in
custody for the shooting, they expected a “breakthrough soon”. “The police and the Hawks have indicated they are following
up on a number of leads,” she added. A R50 000 reward is also being offered by the City for
information on the gunmen. A memorial service is being planned for Wednesday while the
funeral will take place on Saturday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
