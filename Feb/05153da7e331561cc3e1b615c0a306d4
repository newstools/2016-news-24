Johannesburg - The ANC Youth League in Gauteng has described this week's provincial cabinet reshuffle as a "recycling of old faces and friends". "Gauteng is a vibrant, youthful province and in line with our ANCYL national congress resolution on 40% youth representation within all leadership and governance structures... we expect government to be at the forefront of embracing this call and to give space to young talent," provincial chair Matome Chiloane said in a statement. "The reshuffle is therefore a clear signal that [the] Gauteng government's preoccupation is in pleasing the ruling cartel, rather than on holistic development." Gauteng Premier David Makhura on Tuesday night, during an announcement on a cabinet reshuffle, appointed ANC provincial chairperson Paul Mashatile as MEC of human settlements and co-operative governance and traditional affairs. Makhura had announced three changes. Nandi Mayathula-Khoza has been appointed as the MEC for social development and Jacob Mamabolo was moved to the department of infrastructure development. The move to return Mashatile to the provincial government was welcomed by the ANC, SA Communist Party, the Congress of SA Trade Unions and SA National Civic Organisation in Gauteng. Mashatile is the former minister of arts and culture. He was replaced by Nathi Mthethwa after the 2014 general elections. The provincial chair has been an MP since the elections, but will resign from his position in Parliament to take up his new role in Gauteng. However, the provincial ANCYL is adamant that the reshuffle meant nothing for youth representation. "We are sick and tired of individuals treating governance structures as retirement homes or instruments for the accumulation of cartels," said Chiloane. "In this regard we are left with no option but to push for a generational takeover, since generational mix is not even appreciated."
