responded to instances of vitriolic "cyberbullying". Pillay was trolled on Twitter following an apology issued by
the newspaper for a report published three weeks ago concerning DA leader Mmusi
Maimane apparently receiving mentorship from former president FW de Klerk. Over the weekend, Pillay shared two tweets addressed at her, adding: "Cyber bullying. No matter how often it happens I'll never get
used to it." Pillay said that it was not important what the abuse is
linked to, but more that women in the public sphere were dogged by threats. "Before becoming an editor of a national title I was a
columnist for about five years. Both positions have put me in the public eye in
some way and there will of course be criticism and critical engagement which
are always welcome if difficult at times," she said. "It is when certain people cross the line into hate
speech and threats of violence that it becomes problematic," Pillay added. “I once had a man on Twitter threaten to necklace me. I have
received a few abusive posts since the De Klerk/Maimane matter but I don’t
think it’s important what the abuse is linked to. "There is very little room for error or even just doing
one’s job in the public eye. I have chatted to one female reporter who is very
straight up and down in how she engages on social media: just putting across
facts, and she too has had vile threats, with someone telling her once they
hoped she got raped and contracted Aids. Clearly this sort of thing is
unacceptable," she said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
