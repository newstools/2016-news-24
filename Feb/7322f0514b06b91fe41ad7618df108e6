Although shaken, and attending to accident paperwork, she said they were not injured.Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi said the deputy president's lead vehicle was hit by a bakkie which had driven through a red robot.He was not immediately available to clear up the difference in the vehicles involved, or whether a third vehicle was involved. "It was at an intersection where you normally have the lead car blocking off the traffic for the flow and then this bakkie... hit it." He said the bodyguard was taken to hospital and a case of negligent and reckless driving was being investigated.At the time, four men were standing around the black BMW.One was in brown camouflage, and another wore a white cap with the words "Presidential Golf Day" embroidered in black.A white car was parked behind their vehicle.They did not want to talk about the accident.Mulaudzi on Saturday said the the protection unit were just doing their job.Western Cape safety and security spokesperson JP Smith said Premier Helen Zille had tried to stop the ''blue light'' convoys in the province because they had a reputation of intimidating motorists. Legislation was passed to this effect, but the SA Police Services Act does not ban national ministers from using the blue convoy.Smith said none of the Western Cape government's officials move around in this way, including Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille and Zille. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
