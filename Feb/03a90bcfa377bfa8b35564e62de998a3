Haram logistics base in the northeast, possibly hitting an ammunition depot and
dealing a "major setback" to the Islamic extremists. A statement from Group Captain Ayodele Famuyiwa said the
first attack by an unmanned combat aerial vehicle took place when it was
activated over a large gathering of vehicles a kilometre north of the Sambisa
Forest, an insurgent stronghold. It says multiple explosions and huge fire ball shown in
an attached video suggest the drone hit an ammunition and fuel depot. The military said on Saturday that the air force has
conducted 286 operations in a sustained aerial bombardment of the Sambisa
Forest over the past month, covering an area of 157 000 square kilometres.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
