In 2012, nearly 35 000 travellers used the Rafah crossing each month, according to the UN. In 2015, the monthly average fell to less than 2 400.Historically many young Gazan studied in Egypt, while many Palestinians visited their families on the other side of the border.Egyptian forces have also faced accusations of flooding hundreds of cross-border tunnels that were previously used to smuggle goods and allegedly weapons into the territory.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
