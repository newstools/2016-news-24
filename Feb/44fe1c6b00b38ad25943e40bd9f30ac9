The veterans said they wanted both to be expelled. ZNLWVA secretary general Victor Matemadanda said that the war veterans would not be intimidated by Kasukuwere's "thugs", adding that the former liberation fighters planned to petition President Robert Mugabe to rein the two members in for attempting to divide Zanu-PF.Barrage of threats Moyo has attracted a barrage of threats from war veterans in recent times, following his response to an attack by presidential spokesperson, George Charamba, last month.According to a previous News24 report, Charamba warned party members that Mugabe would soon deal with those engaging in succession battles within the ruling party.Charamba's utterances were believed to have been indirectly aimed at Moyo, who is believed to be the leader of a Zanu-PF faction known as Generation 40 (G40).The G40 is opposed to Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa and is allegedly pushing for Grace Mugabe to succeed her husband.Moyo, however, hit back at Charamba, criticising the presidential spokesperson's claim that he spoke on Mugabe's behalf, reported New Zimbabwe War veterans weighed in on Charamba's side, lambasting Moyo for questioning the presidency and vowing to bar him from the next politburo meeting.Moyo has since said that he is not scared of the retired fighters, saying that he can only be stopped by the president of the country. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
