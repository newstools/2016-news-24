Naledi Shange, News24EFF president Julius Malema delivered what he called the "real" State of the Nation Address outside Parliament on Thursday night, competing with President Jacob Zuma's voice booming through speakers on the precinct.WATCHCape Town - Judging by the comments and memes on social networking site, Twitter, South Africans who tuned in to hear President Jacob Zuma's State of the Nation address on Thursday were clearly not only focused on the serious issues being laid down by the president. The disruptions Zuma faced by members of opposition political parties proved to be very entertaining for some.One of the memes that mushroomed on Twitter was that of Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula &nbsp;who was meant to be following proceedings from inside the house. He instead took to Twitter to poke fun at the three Cope MP's who staged a walkout after party leader Mosiuoa Lekota accused Zuma of breaking his oath of office and failing the country.The meme tweeted by Mbalula suggested that their departure from the house made no difference at all.--- --- Sent by WhatsApp the hse is still full, They left and we never saw them ... pic.twitter.com/G7WIfJWju4&mdash; RSA Min of Sport (@MbalulaFikile) February 11, 2016--- --- Sent by WhatsApp the hse is still full, They left and we never saw them ... pic.twitter.com/G7WIfJWju4Lekota was referring to Zuma's refusal to adhere to the public protector's report which claimed he unduly benefited from upgrades at his Nkandla homestead. The public protector had ordered that he pay back some of the money used towards the upgrades. After refusing to pay back the money for over a year, Zuma this week agreed to pay back some of the money.&nbsp;Another popular meme which had hundreds of shares was one by model and television personality Maps Maponyane.&nbsp; He poked fun at the EFF's claims that National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete tried to muzzle them as they interrupted Zuma's speech, demanding clarity on the rules of the house.&nbsp;The tweet depicted a man dressed in a suit whose mouth was being cupped shut by another man whilst pulling at him.&nbsp;"On a point of order honourable speaker..." #SONA2016 pic.twitter.com/A1Lwi8NPwJ&mdash; Maps Maponyane (@MapsMaponyane) February 11, 2016"On a point of order honourable speaker..." #SONA2016 pic.twitter.com/A1Lwi8NPwJThe party was later thrown out of the proceedings.&nbsp;As the EFF left the house, they started chanting "Zupta must fall". The party has been critical of Zuma's relationship with the elite family which owns news channel ANN7 and The New Age. Some of the Gupta members have also done business with government.Comedian Eugene Khoza shared a meme of a smiling Zuma sporting a turban and a large grey beard, suggesting he was now one of the Gupta's.&nbsp;Zero Chill out here ???? #SONA2016 pic.twitter.com/rG1B2s2dm6&mdash; Eugene Khoza (@eugenekhoza) February 11, 2016Zero Chill out here ???? #SONA2016 pic.twitter.com/rG1B2s2dm6Following the EFF's departure from the proceedings, Zuma experienced hardly any more disruptions with only a few politicians throwing comments during the speech.
