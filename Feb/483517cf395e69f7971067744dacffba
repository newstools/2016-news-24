"This is the worst El Nino in history and it has affected the African continent in particular, most dramatically in Ethiopia where 11 million people have been affected."The El Nino warming over the Pacific Ocean has been particularly severe this year with spring and summer rains failing in Ethiopia and causing crops to fail and killing livestock.The $97 million from Usaid will include about 176 000 metric tons of food to be distributed to 4 million people. Since October 2014, the US has given $532m in humanitarian aid to Ethiopia.The UN has issued an international appeal for $1.4bn in emergency funding for Ethiopia, of which less than half has been met by donors.Smith said the US will urge other international donors to step in and support Ethiopia's efforts to deliver food aid and preserve the development gains of the last two decades. Donors have been distracted by crises in Syria, South Sudan, Yemen and the European migration issue, she said.Ethiopia was famously devastated by a drought in the 1980s exacerbated by a civil war that killed hundreds of thousands. Despite the severity of the current drought, the existing government safety net is expected to prevent another famine, according to aid officials.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
