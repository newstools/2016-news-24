''This incident has brought into sharp focus the question of safety on the mines,'' said Zuma. ''We want to know what happened, so that this can be prevented in future.'' The government would have discussions with the mining sector to find out how Pretty Nkambule, Solomon Nyerende and Yvonne Mnisi had died. The three were working in a lamp room in a container when parts of the mine near Barberton fell into a sinkhole almost two weeks ago. The area has been declared too unsafe at present to continue the extensive rescue efforts. Zuma said the government was providing as much support as possible to their families. The leader of the opposition Mmusi Maimane also started his address after the SONA with a message to remember the miners. "We cannot begin to imagine your pain and anguish these past eleven days. We stand with you as a nation, and I hold you and your loved ones in my prayers," said Maimane. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
