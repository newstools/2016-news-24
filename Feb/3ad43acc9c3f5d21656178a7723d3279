It is crucial that we are given unrestricted access now."The warning comes three months after the last UN-backed specialised hunger assessment, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report. That October report warned of a "concrete risk of famine" without aid.20% at riskThere has been no let up in the conflict and while some food has been delivered, civilians report dire conditions. The army and rebels have repeatedly accused each other of breaking an internationally-brokered August ceasefire.The IPC lists famine as a technical measure, which classifies hunger on a scale of one to five. Level five is classified as "catastrophe", and when stretched to 20% of the population, becomes famine.A year ago famine was averted only after a huge intervention by aid agencies.Those worst affected are in the northern battleground state of Unity, once the country's key oil producing region, but now scene of some of the heaviest fighting, including the mass abduction and rape of women and children. The counties of Mayendit, Koch, Leer and Guit are hardest hit. The UN said conditions are "particularly worrisome" because they show an increase in hunger during the post-harvest period, when people should have the most food, warning that the hunger season will start earlier and last longer than normal.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
