THE police confiscated large bags of dagga with an estimated value of R600 000. Flying squad members were patrolling the R300 highway when they received information about a suspicious-looking Toyota Quantum on Friday. Western Cape police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk said: “The cops spotted the minibus on the highway and followed it for a while before ordering the driver to stop at the corner of Sheffield and Stock roads. “Two men between the ages of 34 and 40 were in the vehicle. “The suspects and the minibus were searched and 20 large bags of dagga, as well as R1 490 in cash, were recovered from them.” The men were arrested for possession of dagga and a further investigation was launched to possibly link them with other criminal activities. They will appear in the Philippi Magistrates Court soon. “The police request that people continue to assist with tip-offs because we often make arrests by following up on information provided by the community,” said Van Wyk.
