Not all criticism can be deemed as racism in our country," Hatang said.With race being a critical issue in South Africa, a group of concerned civil society organisations have developed the Anti-Racism Network South Africa (ARNSA) to respond to, and better understand, race relations in South Africa. "We support this initiative because we are building a non-racial, non-sexist and democratic South Africa," said Minister of Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa."We need to globalise the fight against racism," Mthethwa added.In a fight to overcome racism, the the Anti-Racism Network of South Africa (ARNSA), representing more than 60 national organisations, had strengthened efforts to fight back against racism by launching Anti-Racism week.&nbsp; "It's an opportunity to reflect on what can be done from the small to the big issues we face in our country," said CEO of the Ahmed Kathrada foundation, Neeshan Balton.The anti-racism week would take place between March 14-21 2016. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
