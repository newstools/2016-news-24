	     Durban - A family has been shattered in a shooting which claimed the lives of three people in Amanzimtoti on Monday morning.  News24 earlier reported that three people had been killed, but new details have emerged in the case which shook the community of Doonside early this morning.  Police have confirmed that a man is understood to have shot and killed his wife, and then opened fire on a group of neighbours who had tried to intervene.  This all before turning the gun on himself in an apparent murder suicide.  Police spokesperson Major Thulani Zwane said that officers had been called to block of flats in the coastal suburb of Durban shortly after 07:00.  "This morning, there was a domestic related incident where the suspect allegedly shot his wife and three other people,” he said.  "Two died and other two others were injured and taken to hospital for treatment. The suspect also shot himself and died. Two counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and inquest opened at Amanzimtoti police station," Zwane said.  News24 understands that the building's caretaker was among the dead, who along with his daughter, had attempted to reason with the couple as they fought.  The caretaker’s daughter is in a critical condition in the Netcare Kingsway Hospital while another neighbour, also drawn to the flat by the vocal argument, was in a serious condition after being wounded.  A source who could not be named said that the scene was a grisly one, with the body of the caretaker found on the ground floor.  The injured man had left a trail of blood leading to the flat where the bodies of the man and his wife were found. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
