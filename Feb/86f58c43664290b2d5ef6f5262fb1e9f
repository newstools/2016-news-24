Bloemfontein â€“ A week-old baby has survived after being
found abandoned, with a nappy stuffed in her mouth, at an illegal dumping site
in Bloemfontein, Free State police said on Friday. The baby was found on Thursday last week, wrapped in an old
duvet. She was believed to be seven-days-old, said police spokesperson Ikobeng
Hlubi. Hlubi said paramedics were called to the scene and the baby
was rushed to hospital. "The newborn has since been released from hospital and
is now at a place of safety," Hlubi said. Police were investigating a case of child neglect.
