	     Johannesburg – A man was arrested in a multi-million rand drug bust at the OR Tambo International Airport at the weekend, SA Revenue Services (SARS) officials said on Monday.  Officials noticed that the 51-year-old man, who was carrying a suitcase on wheels, was in a hurry to get out of customs on Sunday morning. They scanned the bag to find the drugs were visible in the case. "[The scan] tests revealed a dense green colour that turned out to be drugs in three black plastic bags that confirmed it was crystal methamphetamine," SARS said. The man was handed over to the SA Police Service. It was not immediately clear where he had been travelling to. The man was in possession of a dual Nigerian and South African passport. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
