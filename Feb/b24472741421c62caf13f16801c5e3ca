Lizeka Tandwa, News24  Johannesburg – The inquiry to the collapse of the Grayston
Drive pedestrian bridge, which killed two people, will begin next week, the labour
department said on Thursday. The first session on Tuesday would allow those involved in
the project – construction company Murray & Roberts, scaffolding supplier Form
Scaff, and engineering consultancy firm Royal Haskoning DHV - to outline their
involvement in the project, it said in a statement. No witnesses would be called yet. The bridge over the M1 at Grayston Drive, which was still
under construction, collapsed at 15:30 on Wednesday, October 14. The driver of
a minibus taxi and a man in a Toyota Fortuner were killed. Nineteen people were
injured, three of them critically. Murray & Roberts had appointed technical, engineering,
legal and forensic specialists to investigate the collapse. The labour department, City of Johannesburg, and police were
undertaking their own investigations. The labour department’s chief inspector Tibor Szana said in
October last year that the inquiry was intended to be a neutral forum that
would gather evidence. This would be presented to the National Prosecuting
Authority for a decision on whether someone could be criminally charged.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
