Thulani Gqirana, News24 Protests erupted in Cape Town's CBD ahead of the State of the Nation Address. See the pictures here. Cape Town – The national government needs to cut the Cabinet
and streamline Parliament, Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille said on Friday. This follows President Jacob Zuma's State of the Nation
Address on Thursday, in which he raised the possibility of moving Parliament to
Pretoria. De Lille said the issue was not about moving Parliament to
Pretoria but to cut government wastage. "The key issue is that government
is too big," she said. "National government needs to cut the Cabinet, [and]
streamline and rationalise Parliament in order to save costs to the taxpayer,
and work more efficiently." She said regardless of the possible move, the City of Cape
Town "would always be open to the people of Gauteng". During his speech, Zuma said maintaining two capitals - a
legislative one in Cape Town and an administrative one in Pretoria - was a big
expenditure item. MPs required two houses and two cars, among other expenses. He said the matter required the attention of Parliament soon. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
