The apology and retraction must be displayed prominently in your publication," Dube-Banda was quoted saying.Zhuwawo recently distanced himself from the G40, saying reports that linked him to the group were "mischievous" and were aimed at discrediting him. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
