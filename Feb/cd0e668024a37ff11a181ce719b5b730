Gayapersadh Deosaran, a farm owner in Hazelmere, north of Durban, told News24 on Wednesday many of his farm workers and relatives had encountered the highly venomous snakes. He said a two-metre mamba was relocated from his home on Tuesday. &ldquo;My workers are very fearful of these snakes and rightfully so. They can be quite dangerous. When we find them we try our best to let the snakes go, but yesterday I called a snake catcher friend of mine in. &ldquo;We are just trying to ensure our workers are kept as safe as possible.&rdquo;Private security company Reaction Unit South Africa spokesperson, Prem Balram, said the mamba was found near dog kennels and was captured and released away from the home.Claims of a 4m black mamba &ldquo;The farmer said some of his employees had refused to work on the farm after a large black snake measuring approximately four metres was seen several times on the farm since last year," Balram said. "It was spotted again last week.&rdquo; Deosaran said his brother spotted a four-metre mamba in December. &ldquo;There is one very big one in the field we work in. It was in excess of four metres. In December my brother saw it and was stunned at its size. With the heat and the rain in February they seem to be coming through more often. &ldquo;We are absolutely afraid. We have about 50 staff. We think it lives in a pipe at a nearby bush. I am getting a snake catcher to come through again and hopefully find it.&rdquo;- Health24: Snake bites: what to do- Health24: Dangerous snakes24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
