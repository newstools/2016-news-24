	     Cape Town – Beaufort West Mayor Truman Prince has been fined R10 000 for bringing the ANC into disrepute. This after he was found to have brought the party into disrepute by requesting a tender be given to a construction company which was "sympathetic and having a relationship with the ANC". In a letter that came to light in January, Truman called for the construction companies to benefit so they could, in turn, inject funds into the party's election campaign. After two days of meetings, a disciplinary committee of the ANC's Central Karoo region "sentenced" Prince to a R10 000 fine and a public apology for sending out the letter. He was also asked to formally withdraw the letter. ANC Central Karoo Secretary Windy Plaatjies said Truman had six months to pay the fine. His public apology was meant to go out on Friday, Plaatjies said, but he thought he may not have sent it out to media. While Prince is also facing criminal charges for allegedly assaulting a female traffic officer in January, the incident was not part of the disciplinary proceedings. Prince has rubbished the claims of assault and said he had merely asked the woman to get out of his way "in a gentle and manly way" after he and his partner were stopped for speeding in Leeu Gamka in the Karoo. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
