Both Elliotts are in their 80s.Mediation processNiger presidential spokesperson Abdourahmane Alilou said on Saturday night that Jocelyn Elliott appeared alongside Niger President Mahamadou Issoufou in the Niger town of Dosso, located about 140km southeast of the capital, Niamey.Jocelyn Elliott "was freed following mediation led by the president of Niger, Mahamadou Issoufou, and presented to the press this afternoon in Dosso," Alilou said. He said Burkina Faso intelligence services had also been involved in securing her release and that efforts were ongoing to free Ken Elliott.Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb rose to prominence in large part through kidnap-for-ransom operations targeting foreign aid workers and tourists.In recent months, the group has grabbed headlines with claims of responsibility for high-profile strikes in West Africa, killing 20 people in an attack on a hotel in Mali's capital in November and 30 people in an attack in Burkina Faso's capital the same day the Elliotts were kidnapped. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
