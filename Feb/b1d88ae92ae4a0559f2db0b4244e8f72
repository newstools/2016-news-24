	     Mombasa - A 32-year-old pregnant Kenyan woman, who chopped off her husband's penis on Friday, has been arrested. Pauline Mukiri was arrested at Kiembeni Estate in Mombasa on Saturday evening and was being held at the Bamburi police station. Mukiri attacked Alloys Matata at a local bar, where sources said he was having a good time with another woman, Daily Nation reported.  When they got home that evening, she chopped off his penis and left him for the dead. Matata was rescued by neighbours who rushed him to the hospital, but he succumbed to injuries. The couple had been staying together for one year, according to Citizen TV. Mukiri maintained that she acted in self-defence. Watch the video video:  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
