More than 400 people have been killed and some 230 000 have fled the country in the conflict that the United Nations fears could slide into ethnic warfare, similar to the conflict that led to the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is expected to travel to Burundi on Monday to push for political talks and a stronger international presence to pull the country back from the brink, diplomats said.A UN panel of experts reported last month that Rwanda had recruited refugees, including children, in a camp in eastern Rwanda and provided them with two months of military training with a view to oust Nkurunziza.The United States, which has friendly relations with Rwandan President Paul Kagame, has said the reports of Kigali's military activities in Burundi are credible. During a visit to Burundi in January, Security Council ambassadors heard Nkurunziza blame Rwanda for the violence in his country.France is preparing a draft resolution that could provide for a UN police force to be deployed to Burundi to help quell the violence after Nkurunziza rejected a proposed 5 000 African Union peacekeeping force. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
