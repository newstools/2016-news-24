It is pushing for Grace Mugabe to succeed her nonagenarian husband.The group reportedly comprises First Lady Grace Mugabe, Vice President Phelekezela Mphoko, Zanu-PF national commissar Saviour Kasukuwere and Higher and Tertiary Education Minister Jonathan Moyo.The nonagenarian is said to be under pressure to hold together the ruling party, as both groups are threatening violence against each other in order to succeed him.&nbsp;According to NewsDay, Zhuwao said claims that he belonged to the G40 were mischievous and were aimed at discrediting him, thus, hindering him from doing his government job.Zhuwao, who is the minister of youth, indigenisation and economic empowerment, assumed the role after a cabinet reshuffle by Mugabe in 2015. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
