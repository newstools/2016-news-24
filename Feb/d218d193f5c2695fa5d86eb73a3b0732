The water was warm and crystal clear.Former bodyboarding world champion Sacha Specker - who now enjoys stand-up surfing - had just ridden a long 100 metre wave and had paddled back out into a group of surfers waiting for waves in the line-up.A surfer screamed "Shark, right behind you!" and he jolted around. This appeared to startle the shark."I saw it change direction abruptly and dip below me. A moment later it resurfaced an arm&rsquo;s length from me, jet black eye, white belly, flank and pectoral fin in view as it pushed a bow wave and brushed my feet. Dorsal fin out the water, and tail fin slow and steady side to side, always in sight, while circling me four times.Time stood still for the terrified surfer who tried to face the shark by pivoting around as it circled.Eventually the shark moved off towards the beach and he thought it was over. However, it resurfaced and headed straight for him.Nearby, big wave surfer Mike Schlebach shouted to other surfers in the water to stay calm and paddle to the hapless victim. The surfers paddled towards the shark to help, and paddled to shore packed tightly around Specker.*This article originally appeared on the website Wavescape.
