There are two primary schools in the area who are also overcrowded,&rdquo; regional education representative Dr Benjamin Molokoe told members of the committee.&ldquo;All these primary schools are feeding Mphe-Bana as it is the only English medium school around the area. A contractor is appointed to renovate the school toilets.&rdquo;Molokoe told the committee that the no-fee school was initially planned to accommodate 650 pupils, but currently has 1 690.He said the school has 48 teachers, three vacancies for teaching posts, two for deputy principals and one for a head of department.The committee further heard that the school has a shortage of 509 desks and 442 chairs.Molokoe said while the department has managed to secure 100 chairs and 100 desks, 60 of them are for pre-school children.The department is expected to provide four mobile classes and 10 VIP toilets.Committee chairperson, Boitumelo Moiloa, said the school is in a serious crisis and needs immediate intervention from the department.&ldquo;The department should come up with measurable long term solutions that address the current challenges of the school, including shortage of critical positions of the two deputy principals. Outstanding mobile classes should be accompanied by proper desks and chairs.&ldquo;We are happy with efforts of the school management even though they are working under these dire circumstances. The school has done well on matric results by acquiring 85.96% in 2015,&rdquo; said Moiloa. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
