In the past, she has laid bigamy charges against him and, yet, Mandla, has defied various legal interdicts to carry out two - and now three - marriages subsequent to that. &nbsp; Mandela wed second wife Anais Grimaud in a traditional ceremony in 2010.&nbsp; In 2013, Mandla accused his younger brother, Mbuso, of impregnating Grimaud. &nbsp;Their marriage was later annulled. &nbsp; In 2014, his marriage to third wife Mbali Makhathini, whom he married in 2011, also in a traditional ceremony - was also declared null and void in court. Pictures on Twitter appear to show Mandela and Clarke wed according to a traditional Muslim Nikah ceremony. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
