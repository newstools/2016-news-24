"President Jacob Zuma has arrived back in Pretoria this afternoon, 27 February 2016, following the visit to Burundi where he led the African Union High Level Delegation sent to assist in strengthening the peace process," said presidential spokesperson Bongani Majola. This was not the first time that Inkwazi had been grounded due to mechanical difficulties. In 2015, Zuma faced intense criticism following reports that R4bn would be spent on acquiring a new plane for him and his entourage. It was reported that the luxury jet would also have a conference room, bathroom and private bedroom and would accommodate 30 passengers. Mosiua Lekota, who was defence minister when the Inkwazi was bought, said the price included R300m for the jet, and R108m to fit and decorate the interior, according to News24's archive. During the outcry over the proposed new jet, University of Pretoria politics lecturer Roland Henwood told News24 that only US President Barack Obama had a better plane that Zuma. "There are world leaders who have presidential jets, but they are business jets. They are much smaller than what [Zuma] has at this stage," Henwood said. "Only president Obama has a better aircraft." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
