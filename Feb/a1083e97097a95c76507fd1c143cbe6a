After 34 years, Opal is comfortable in her environment.&ldquo;We feel it would be detrimental and traumatic, even potentially fatal, for her to endure transportation and adaptation to a new climate or facility. The proposed facility in the UK [Monkey World] that the SPCA would like to have Opal relocated to, is not a registered charity, and is in fact a breeding facility that profits from the display of primates in the form of admissions.&rdquo;He said such facilities used media campaigns such as the SPCA&rsquo;s to generate donations.&ldquo;Many attempts&rdquo; had been made to find another mate for Opal, and &ldquo;the government&rdquo; had denied permits in a bid to prevent breeding.&ldquo;We are saddened that there are so-called &lsquo;welfare&rsquo; organisations casting aspersions about a mentally and physically healthy animal for their own financial gain,&rdquo; said Boswell.NSPCA spokesperson Isabel Wentzel denied they were involved in a publicity stunt and said Thandora the elephant had died of &ldquo;botulism poisoning, a condition unrelated to her release&rdquo;, and not from &ldquo;questionable causes&rdquo;.She said Opal was &ldquo;miserable and lonely&rdquo;, and denied Boswell&rsquo;s claims that Monkey World would be a negative environment for her.While admitting that Monkey World was not a charity, she maintained it was reputable and supported by the Born Free Foundation and the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW).24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
