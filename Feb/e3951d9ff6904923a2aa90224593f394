Marthinus Theunis Steyn at the University of the Free State from further
vandalism on Thursday. About 10 security guards had been on guard since early
morning, protecting the likeness of the Orange Free State's president, after it
was slightly vandalised. EFF protesters pulled down and vandalised a statue of
Charles Robberts Swart at the university on Tuesday morning. They burnt tyres
at the foot of the statue, and used hammers and rocks to get it down. CR Swart served as the last Governor General of Union of
South Africa from 1960 to 1961. On Tuesday, EFF supporters in red T-shirts and berets,
spilled onto the campus and blockaded the main gate, while others vandalised
the statue and law buildings. The protesters smashed glass cabinets and spray-painted the
words "Robert Sobukwe Law School" on one of the buildings. Student Representative Council vice president, Mpho Khati,
told students they were the university's new management and would make the
institution ungovernable until their demands, which included that the university
directly employ contract workers, were met. The CR Swart statue was still lying in a pond in front of
the law faculty on Thursday afternoon. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
