Tom Nkosi, News24 CorrespondentMbombela - African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) deputy president Desmond Moela has accused MECs in Mpumalanga of being "useless looters".During a press briefing in Mbombela on Thursday, Moela, who is also the organisation&rsquo;s provincial chairperson in Mpumalanga, reiterated his call on Premier David Mabuza to reshuffle his cabinet."Our honourable premier must do reshuffling (sic). Out of the nine MECs, about seven of them must fall because they are useless. Actually, they are excited about blue lights and so on, so we can&rsquo;t accept that," said Moela.The young firebrand also accused the MECs of looting everything in their departments."We are going to make sure that if they do not fall some of them (sic), we are going to say 'Premier, take this one to that department, because this one has looted more in this department, he has taken everything, now take this one to that department' and so on," he said.When asked if the ANCYL was acknowledging that there was corruption in Mpumalanga, Moela backtracked, claiming that those who say there is corruption do not know what corruption is.He said when he said the MECs had looted, he meant that the MECs were not looting money, but were looting "time"."When we say they are looting we are actually saying some of them have looted our time. Our young people are not taken care of. That&rsquo;s what we are saying," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
