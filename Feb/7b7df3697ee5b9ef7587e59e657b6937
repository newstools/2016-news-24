"They have burnt a number of our fleet cars, they have damaged private property, they continue to burn property, they have looted the warehouse, they have looted the campus kitchen which supplies the cafeteria - the food that the kids end up eating and buying. &nbsp;So there has been widespread vandalism on the Mthatha campus,&rdquo; she said.Interim vice chancellor Khaya Mfenyana shut the campus on Tuesday. Students were told to vacate their residences until calm was restored.
