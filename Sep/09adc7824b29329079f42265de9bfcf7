Police are investigating the armed robbery. In a Facebook post, Dwain Dreyer said that a gang of men had also kicked his dog after they forced their way into his home. "I was woken up with a 9mm in my face, dragged out of bed, my dog wanted to chow him but she got kicked," he posted. He was then, "forced to open for the rest who were waiting outside with rifles and automatic guns... ransacked the house and garage... the initial guy who made entry by bending a burglar bar in the kitchen held me on the kitchen floor with a gun to the back of my head saying he will shoot me before they leave". He added that on inspection of his property afterwards, police had surmised that the intruders had first tried to force open the garage door with a spade. "Detectives found my laptop in the driveway&hellip; chain on gate had been cut and alarm beams on the front had their wires cut... thank goodness I'm OK," he said. Dreyer said that his initial instinct was to try and grapple with his attacker. "At first I thought it was just the one guy so I tried fighting him off until I saw another couple making threats through the window to open the door"&rdquo; he said. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said that no arrests had been made. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
