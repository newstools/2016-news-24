The operation is most expensive when vets and conservationists are working in very bushy terrain.&nbsp;In those conditions, Marabini says they need "a fixed wing aircraft with a spotter to keep an eye on the rhino, as well as a helicopter to dart from."&nbsp;Significant protective effect&nbsp;Dehorning rhinos to put off poachers is not a new step in Zimbabwe: it has been happening since the early 1990s here.It was one of a cocktail of measures introduced as poaching took an enormous toll on what had been a thriving population of rhinos in Zimbabwe.&nbsp;Government estimates from the mid-1980s put the figure of black rhinos alone in Zimbabwe at as many as 3 000, although at least one expert has suggested the total was more likely around 2,000.&nbsp;The total number of black rhinos in Zimbabwe dipped to as low as 300, though it has climbed since then.While dehorning rhinos has had a significant protective effect on populations in parts of the region, other anti-poaching methods may be considered particularly when conservationists are trying to protect large numbers of rhinos living in large areas. &nbsp; Drones are one such method.Zimbabwe has recently acquired drones to help fight elephant poaching in the west of the country, it was reported last month.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
