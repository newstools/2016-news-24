Student leaders in Tshwane are said to be holding meetings to discuss the way forward following the announcement that institutions will determine their own fee increments as long as they do not exceed 8%. The EFF student command at the University of Pretoria said students would indicate which direction they would take. "We are going to meet with students today then engage with the vice chancellor," Lungile Sonwabo told News24."We will wait to hear from her regarding this matter and establish how much the university will decide on. That will determine the type of action that is to be taken," he said. Student activist Vusi Mahlangu said different structures were co-ordinating meetings to dissect the announcement. He however indicated that they were opposed to any increment. "We are still engaging in meetings because we are planning on going to the streets. We reject the announcement, we will accept nothing but free education," he said.Mahlangu added that they were planning a consultative meeting with structures from all universities and colleges in Gauteng in the next few days. He said based on that meeting, they would decide on what type of action would be taken.#FeesMustFall2016 #Fees2017 Betogende studente by UP het nou die Sanlam-ouditorium oorgeneem. @Nico_Gous pic.twitter.com/O109VTT54O24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
