No matter how long it will take," an emotional Patson declared.&nbsp;He reiterated his claims that the government had never cared about the whereabouts of his brother.Itai has been missing since March 2015 after bravely staging lone protests calling on President Robert Mugabe to step down in central Harare's Africa Unity Square.'Morbid and senseless act'Reports said that five men stormed a barbershop in Harare and accused him of stealing a cow before they bundled him into an unmarked white twin-cab bakkie.Opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader Morgan Tsvangirai&nbsp;slammed the abduction, saying that&nbsp;he held Mugabe and his government responsible."We hold Mugabe and his regime responsible for this morbid and senseless act," Tsvangirai was quoted as saying at the time.An author and speaker, Patson mounted his own protest in front of Mugabe on independence day on April 18.
