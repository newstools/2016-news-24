The majority of students fell within the "missing middle" and National Student Financial Aid Scheme-eligible categories."We are pleased that this subsidisation will ease the financial burden for most of our students and their families."Nzimande, speaking at a press briefing in Pretoria on Monday, said tertiary institutions should not increase fees by more than&nbsp;8%. &nbsp; University council to make a decision "We have looked at the challenges at hand from all sides and have concluded that the best approach would be to allow universities individually to determine the level of increase that their institutions will require," he said."With the caution that this has to also take into account affordability of students, and therefore has to be transparent, reasonable and related to inflation-linked adjustments, our recommendation is that the fee adjustments should not go above 8%." The government, he said, would assist households with an income of up to R600 000 per annum with subsidy funding to cover the gap between the 2015 fee and adjusted 2017 fee at the relevant institutions. UWC said it would now embark on a process to "engage the appropriate university structures, including student structures".The university council would then make a final decision.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
