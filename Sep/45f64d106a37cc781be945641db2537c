We are being whipped here. It means we are guilty. Safe to say the EFF was not part of this House before 2014.&ldquo;There can never be any fig leaf to cover our nakedness, whenever there is political expediency. Let&rsquo;s go back to basics.&rdquo;Democratic Alliance MP Tsepo Mhlongo said the ruling was a warning for Parliament to not launch a project without following due process.United Democratic Movement MP Mncedisi Filtane said the National Council of Provinces should get the blame.&lsquo;ANC is still leading&rsquo;ANC MP PJ Mnguni said opposition parties were quick to blame the ANC when Parliament failed, but wanted to &ldquo;bask in the glory&rdquo; when it succeeded.&ldquo;Whenever the other side scores, the game is on,&rdquo; he hit back.&ldquo;The ConCourt was like the referee. The DA thinks it&rsquo;s the end of the game because they have scored one goal and they have won. The ANC has many goals. The ANC are still leading.&rdquo;ANC MP Andrew Madella said the 166 000 new claims indicated that reopening the process had been the right decision.DA MP Thomas Walters was magnanimous, saying the party welcomed the fact that pre-1999 claims were finally being dealt with. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
