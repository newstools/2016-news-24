The girls demanded that current principal Charmaine Murray step down from her position after allegations of discrimination.Murray has been placed on special leave by the school's board of governors. It is unclear if she will be attending the meeting on Monday."We hope she will be there," protest convener and past pupil Billie-Jean Demas told News24 on Monday."We want all stakeholders to be there, which includes students, parents, alumni and the governing body."Victimisation fearsDemas said past pupils and former head girl Nicole Jones were speaking on behalf of the current student body to spare them from potential victimisation.The protesters want the school's code of conduct to be revised regarding hair policies, as well as to address issues of language and marginalisation at the school.Schafer said in a statement on Saturday that she supports the call for a new code of conduct at Sans Souci."I am extremely concerned about some shocking allegations that were brought to my attention yesterday. I am equally concerned that they say they sent a complaint to the department in 2011, which was seemingly not acknowledged and yielded no change," she said."My response was that I see nothing wrong with braids as long as their hair is neat and tidy. I was also informed that the current group who are dealing with the new policy does not include one black African learner, despite the majority of learners at the school being black African."This is just unacceptable."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
