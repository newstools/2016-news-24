"He is very outspoken and he has raised his views and we need to engage the views he has raised as the ANC," Tau told News24.ANC branches in Johannesburg met last weekend and resolved to confront the problems facing the organisation. The Gauteng provincial executive committee called for a consultative conference to discuss if the ANC&rsquo;s current leadership was fit to lead.&nbsp; Tau said Gauteng branches had not yet discussed who they would propose to be the next ANC president.&nbsp; "Most of the delegates were saying, let&rsquo;s start with the first task. Let&rsquo;s deal with the issues and then we talk about leadership."Tau dismissed claims that the ANC was becoming irrelevant, saying it was still an important role player in the country."The ANC remains relevant. It has a critical role to play in South Africa, but it has to confront the issues it has and to reassure the people of our commitment to build a national democratic society."In his address during the ANC's regional consultative conference in Nelson Mandela Bay over the weekend, former president Kgalema Motlanthe warned the party that if it did not get its house in order, it faced becoming irrelevant.Motlanthe compared the ANC to other African liberation movements who lost their hegemony after they had been in power for 20 years.During the funeral of former sports minister Makhenkesi Stofile in August, Pityana said the ANC&rsquo;s lack of accountable leadership resulted in it losing metros to the opposition in the local government elections."That our movement is in crisis is trite and it is beyond question. If you doubted it, look at what happened in the local government elections," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
