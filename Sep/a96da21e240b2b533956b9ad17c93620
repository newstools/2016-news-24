It does not have an effect on the blood alcohol readings.Blood clotting, butanol tracesAnother anomaly included four cases of blood clotting during 53 separate tests.Edmonds-Smith said that all South African blood samples should contain one of two substances that prevent any clotting from occurring when tested.Lastly, the sample contained traces of tertiary butanol. This was problematic because tertiary butanol is the only alcohol which is solid at room temperature, she said.Edmonds-Smith said she would like to know how the butanol got into the sample.Blood samples used in legal cases are handled by the Department of Health.Edmonds-Smith's business partner, Claire Lewis, also testified on Friday.Lewis told the court that there are two published journal articles showing that ethanol can be created in refrigerated blood samples under certain conditions.State prosecutor Leon Snyman disputed the two publications, saying one had only focused on post-mortem blood, while the other focused on blood refrigerated over a few days, as opposed to a few weeks, as was necessary in Yengeni's case.Forensic testimony and cross-examination will continue next week. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
