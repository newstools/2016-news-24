Duesseldorf district court spokesperson Marcel Due said a judge dropped the charges on Thursday on condition that he do 20 hours community work and hand in the three-page, handwritten essay.Due says the boy, whose name wasn't released in keeping with German privacy rules, said the incident in May was meant as a prank and denied having any Islamic extremist motivation. He told the court he found the fake grenade lying in the schoolyard. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
