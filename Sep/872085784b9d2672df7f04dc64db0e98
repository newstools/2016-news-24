	     Pietermaritzburg - KwaZulu-Natal police on Thursday denied claims that a case of rape had been opened against a police officer following protests at UKZN. Police were investigating a case of sexual assault, Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said. “We acknowledge that a student in Pietermaritzburg did report a case of sexual assault which occurred whilst students were being pushed back by police. The matter is currently receiving attention.” Acting KwaZulu-Natal police commissioner Major-General Bhekinkosi Langa expressed his concern that certain parties had claimed they were failing to investigate the matter. “We are committed to dealing firmly with police officers who find themselves guilty of misconduct or crime.” University of KwaZulu-Natal spokesperson Lesiba Seshoka said the alleged sexual assault took place off campus on Monday. A woman who said she was a UKZN school of arts lecturer, Pumelela Nqelenga, wrote on Facebook that a police officer raped the female student at the Pietermaritzburg campus. “SAPS raped a student last night during the protest,” she wrote. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
