He said they increased pleasure, smelt better, reduced noise, and provided better protection.'Here to save lives'&ldquo;It is possible that she is treating this matter flippantly,&rdquo; Ramaphosa replied.&ldquo;My responsibility when introducing the new condoms was to spread the message of prevention for HIV/Aids,&rdquo; he said to applause from delegates."We are here to prevent a disease that is spreading in our country. We want young people to be aware of the pandemic still underway."In answering Mokwele's original question on a national minimum wage, Ramaphosa said government, unions and the private sector, had not yet agreed on the issue.He said a seven-person panel was being brought in to help the government task team arrive at a consensus. Employers would be given ample warning of an increased minimum wage to avoid unnecessary job losses, he said. &nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
