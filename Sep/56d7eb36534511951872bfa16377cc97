Complaints from residents regarding the informal settlement resulted in them being relocated to a farm in the region purchased by Fred and Susan Barnard.The Uitenhage Lions Club recently paid them a visit and provided food parcels to the approximately 25 families residing in Place of Hope. Housing consists of old shacks and caravans with the main house accommodating approximately 90 residents in the settlement, said Lion Denis Murphy from the Uitenhage Lions Club. Place of Hope raises funds through the selling of firewood and residents provide their labour free of cost in the maintenance of the site. Water is obtained from a bore hole on site and a mobile clinic has been arranged to commence visiting the site once a month, starting during this month [September]. All children on site are at primary school level and transport is provided free of cost to the nearby Altona Primary School, said Murphy. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
