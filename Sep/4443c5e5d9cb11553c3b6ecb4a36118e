The African News Agency reports that Renamo fighters fled the attack in the central province of Zambezia on Saturday. The South Africa-based agency quotes police spokesperson Jacinto Felix as saying there were no casualties. The operation followed attacks in the area by suspected Renamo militants. International mediators are trying to help end violence linked to tensions between Renamo and the ruling Frelimo party, which fought each other in a civil war that ended in 1992. The current violence does not match the scale of the earlier conflict, but it has hurt tourism and other economic activity in this southern African country. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
