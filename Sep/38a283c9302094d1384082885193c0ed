Jeff Wicks, News24 Durban - A 65-year-old Howick man died after a scuffle in the parking lot of the St Ives September Festival, KwaZulu-Natal police said on Monday. He apparently collapsed after an "altercation" with another man on Saturday, Captain Nqobile Gwala said. The other man had allegedly punched him. A case of murder was opened at the Howick police station, but no arrests had yet been made. St Ives spokesperson Ashley Bloxham said the scuffle took place in the parking lot after the festival had ended. "It was a freak accident and a man died. The police are investigating the incident. The man who died is a close family friend, so this is a very touchy subject for us," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
