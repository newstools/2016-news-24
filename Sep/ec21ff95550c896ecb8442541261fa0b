We note and are mindful of the concerns you are raising ie deaths and diseases," he said.This was hypocritical, Nzuzo said, given that even in the formal sector miners died or became sick."This is the formal sector being operated mainly by racist monopoly capital, the chief representative of which is the Chamber of Mines. We are not promoting illegality but are proposing a revisitation of the moral thinking around legality to start with.&ldquo;We also reject the tendency of our comrades who, as soon as they ascend to positions of power, use existing punitive law as their first point of reference in resolving developmental challenges."State mining holdingsNzuzo questioned the slow progress of the African Exploration Mining and Finance Corporation Bill, which was gazetted at the beginning of 2016."This is consistent with the ANC NGC [national general council] instruction to strengthen the State Mining Company through 'consolidation of all state mining holdings'.&nbsp; However, since the gazette we have not heard much progress on the finalisation of the process; we want to know when will this be effected as Parliament will soon be going on recess."The youth league secretary general also called for Zwane to make his position on the review of the mining charter public so the ANCYL can "mobilise all progressive social forces in defence of progressive amendments to the charter and to further elaborate on other areas that require strengthening".In the letter, Nzuzo also informed the minister that failure to facilitate a speedy passing of amendments to the Mineral Petroleum Resources Development Bill would affect operations of the state mining company.The letter, however, does not mention the controversy Zwane is currently embroiled in after he was called to order by President Jacob Zuma after he issued a statement suggesting a judicial commission of inquiry into the banking sector over the Gupta saga.The president on Tuesday told Parliament he was still dealing with Zwane on the matter. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
