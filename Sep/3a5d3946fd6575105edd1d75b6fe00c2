"There is no fence, there is no cutting, there is nothing to visually mark it, but the elephants know, 'I am safe here, I'm not safe here'".Pope said "there is every reason to believe that elephants are voting with their feet and moving from unsafe areas to safe areas".Save the Elephants also works in Virunga National Park in eastern Congo, which is home to multiple armed groups competing for control of the region's vast mineral resources. Some have been accused of killing elephants for their tusks. Elephants there stick closely to ranger's posts, Pope said.The elephant populations worst hit by poaching are in Tanzania, Gabon, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Mozambique, Republic of Congo and Congo.Kenya has said it will push for the total ban on the trade in ivory at the CITES meeting. It says the temporary lifting of the ban in 2007 to allow some countries to offload their stockpiles fuelled the resurgence of killing elephants to sell their tusks, primarily to China and southeast Asian countries. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
