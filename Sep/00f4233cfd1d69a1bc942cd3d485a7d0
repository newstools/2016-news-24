	     Cape Town - The man accused of killing 7-month-old Inganathi Mnyani cut a resolute figure in the Western Cape High Court on Friday, as he heard he would remain in custody for another month. Dressed in a white hoodie, black jacket, and dark pants, Zukile Nakupi stood in the dock with a deep-set frown on his face. At the pre-trial hearing, Judge Robert Henney heard the defence would need to take further instructions. The matter would return to court for another hearing on October 14. Nakupi pursed his lips and was led away by police officers. He was arrested four days after the baby’s murder on January 18. He allegedly flung the baby against the ceiling, walls and prepaid electricity meter of her mother's Philippi home. The couple allegedly started arguing after she woke up to feed Inganathi in the early hours of the morning. Nakupi allegedly jumped on Inganathi's body, despite attempts from her 7-year-old sister to protect the baby.  The infant died at the scene. At the start of the year, great-uncle Bongani Nunu told News24 her murder had been difficult for the family. “Even at her young age, she wasn’t naughty. Inganathi was a quiet baby. She was a child who listened,” he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
