Most of the foreigners were tried in absentia.A month later, the military led by Sisi overthrew the unpopular Islamist president Mohamed Morsi, unleashing a crackdown on the Islamist opposition as well as rights activists.Successive governments since 2011 have said that financing for civil society groups should be streamlined and more transparent, but have been accused of trying to control civil society funding.Some rights NGOs have complained that they work in a legal grey zone, sometimes not receiving the relevant permits to operate which may lead to their closure at the authorities' whim.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
