When the luxury vehicles the City currently owned needed to be replaced, sensible, low cost-vehicles would be procured. The Hyundai i20 or Toyota Corolla could serve the same purpose, Msimanga said.Makhubela said the partnership with BMW contributed to the city&rsquo;s revenue and created jobs. BMW in Rosslyn had invested in an early childhood development institution for township residents, and a clinic.He said Hyundai did not manufacture its cars in South Africa.Msimanga's spokesperson, Matthew Gerstner, said he was not surprised that the ANC was complaining about the decision."It is not unexpected that the ANC is uncomfortable about us exposing their lavish, luxury and totally wasteful spending on politicians' cars."He said BMW&rsquo;s history in Tshwane was a source of pride for the city, but did not entitle politicians to luxury cars, paid for with public money, that did not benefit the poor. The money that would be saved on the cars would be spent on service delivery instead.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
