During his stay the runner approached him offering to help him claim compensation from the Road Accident Fund but the patient declined the offer saying he could not afford a lawyer. When the patient made an enquiry about his file it was discovered that it was missing.After collaborating with hospital staff and police the patient managed to secure a meeting with the runner who was then caught in the act.
