This was because the surgery required opening the chest cavity and a ventilator.&ldquo;It broke our doctor&rsquo;s hearts to have to put this bundle of hugs and kisses to sleep for financial reasons, so it was decided to perform the surgery,&rdquo; the animal organisation said.A team of theatre surgeons, nurses and orderlies performed the corrective surgery.&ldquo;We were extremely proud of how well our team handled the theatre pressure as well as ensuring Snoekie was manually ventilated. There were many sighs of relief when little Snoekie began breathing on her own.&rdquo;&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
