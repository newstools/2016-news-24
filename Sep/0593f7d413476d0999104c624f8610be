In 2015, losses amounted to R128m.Meanwhile, Prasa is battling to pay the money it owes to two security companies charged with keeping the trains and commuters safe.The damage came in the middle of a court order forcing Prasa to pay outstanding invoices to the two security companies contracted to keep the lines, trains and stations safe.Chuma Security and Supreme Security Services were owed R7.3m together but are battling to get the money.The guards work along the commuter routes to Strand, Wellington, Langa, Bonteheuwel and Khayelitsha and are considered an important deterrent to crime on trains.The companies have already been granted two attachment orders - one for a train, and one for computer equipment - both of which were carried out.The companies said in their court application that without their invoices being settled they cannot pay their employees. And if the employees do not get paid they cannot afford to pay their own financial responsibilities, even transport to get to work.In the last application Chuma Security was owed R2.4m and Supreme Security Services is owed two payments of R2.4m each.Sithethi Ngcwangu, a managing member of Chuma Security, said his staff did not believe him when he explained that he could not pay them until Prasa paid him.They kept going to work, but were showing signs of not even being able to afford the transport to do this anymore.After the last order, he said Prasa was able to find enough money last week to pay them R900 000 each of what was owed."If the guards don't go to work, it is considered breach of contract," said a worried Ngcwangu.Scott declined to comment, saying it was a contractual issue.The companies were awarded the contracts in May 2011 and the last application was their sixth to force payment since 2013.Ngcwangu said there was hope that Treasury might step in to alleviate the situation so that they could be paid, and workers would be able to catch up with their own debts caused by not getting their salaries. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
