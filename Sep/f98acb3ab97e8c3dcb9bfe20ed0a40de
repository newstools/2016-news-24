"The managing director welcomed that the president indicated the Government of Mozambique's willingness to work with the IMF on the terms-of-reference for this process -- to be initiated by the office of the attorney general - and to implement it," he said in a statement.He said that an IMF staff team would visit the country next week.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
