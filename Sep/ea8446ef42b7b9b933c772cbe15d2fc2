These workshops, which were conducted throughout the month of August, were conducted at Hazeldene, Delta and Isiphiwo Primary Schools.During the sessions children were urged to report missing friends as soon as possible and shown videos which showed how easily kids can get snatched.Grade Seven teacher from Isiphiwo Primary School in Khayelitsha Mr Nxasana, says his learners live in a dangerous community where the possibility of getting stolen is a reality. I know it will make a huge contribution to the grade seven learners as they embark on high school in 2017; they can easily fall victim of human trafficking and it can happen to anyone, he says. Missing Children South Africa (MCSA) was established in March 2007 in an effort to create awareness on the reality on the number of children who go missing in South Africa. According to figures released by the South African Police Service Missing Persons Bureau 2013, a child goes missing every five hours in South Africa. Thus far, MCSA, together with the SAPS, has managed to safely bring home 77% of registered missing children. The organisation runs purely on the generosity of sponsors and donors and is not funded by the government.
