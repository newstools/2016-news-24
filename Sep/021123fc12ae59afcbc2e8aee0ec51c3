The two houses of parliament will then vote for a president.The current president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, has begun campaigning for a second term.The election will not be the one-person, one-vote process that is promised in Somalia's constitution. But it is viewed as paving the way for that, and is much more inclusive than the last vote in 2012, when only 135 clan chiefs participated.Somalia sank into a devastating civil war in 1991 when warlords ousted president Mohamed Siad Barre, plunging the country into years of chaos.The security situation remains troubled, largely due to the Shabaab, radical Islamists linked to Al-Qaeda.The Shabaab, which was forced out of the capital Mogadishu five years ago, continues to launch attacks against government, military, civilian and foreign targets in its fight to overthrow the government.The group is expected to try to violently disrupt the elections.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
