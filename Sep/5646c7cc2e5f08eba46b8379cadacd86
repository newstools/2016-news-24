There was no anesthesiologist there, and the doctor gave Marrero too much of the sedative drug, Fried said.At a news conference in Fried's office to announce the settlement, Marrero's wife, Rachel, recalled her shock when she was told that the father of her three young sons had died.'Just a sore throat'She told health centre workers: "He just had a sore throat, what do you mean he passed?"After the news conference, the health centre's executives hugged her and offered condolences."Our providers work tirelessly to assure that the best quality of care is given to our patients, and we grieve that in this case things occurred the way they did and we have this unfortunate outcome," Chief Medical Officer Dr Stephen Bradley said.The executives declined to disclose the emergency doctor's name, but the lawsuit named Dr Robert Bonham. Bradley later released a statement from Bonham where he offered condolences and said he couldn't provide details about the case because of an ongoing formal review.The US Department of Health and Human Services is conducting the review, Bradley said.Marrero said she was hopeful that the health centre, known locally as "the comp," will follow through with promised steps to make sure that a similar death never happens again.Changes implementedThe health centre implemented changes after the death, including a new emergency room director overseeing operations and a full-time chief compliance officer who is also an attorney. A new emergency room facility is scheduled to be completed within a year, though plans for that were underway before the incident, Bradley said."I don't hate or judge," Marrero said. "I just hope that the comp does make everything better for other families."The federal government will pay the settlement because the centre is a federally qualified community non-profit health centre that's insured by the Federal Tort Claims Act, said centre President and Chief Executive Officer Richard Bettini. "In exchange, we take anyone regardless of ability to pay," he said.Fried praised the settlement and said people living in west Oahu's Waianae community should feel comfortable receiving care there.He noted that Bettini arranged for money to be set aside for the family's living expenses while they waited for the settlement, which was reached last year but required about a year of federal approvals.'He never came home'Marrero said her maintenance mechanic husband stayed home with his sore throat for about a week, struggling to eat and suffering fevers. When his vacation time ran out, he went back to work, where his employers advised him to seek medical attention, she said."He went right after work, and he never came home," she said.She called her husband a "gentle giant" who provided for his family."We had kids, got married, bought our house," she said. "It was a dream come true for me."The structured settlement will pay a fixed monthly amount for the remainder of the lives of Marrero and her children, Fried said.One of the first things she's doing with the money is rebuilding their home that burned down just a few days before Christmas in 2014, she said. "It won't ever bring my husband back," she said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
