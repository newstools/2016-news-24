Cape Town - A constable was one of four alleged armed robbers arrested following a heist at a Bellville store on Wednesday night, Western Cape police have confirmed. The 35-year-old officer, in possession of a state-owned gun and ammunition, was arrested following the business robbery in Voortrekker Road at 20:30, spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said. Two robbers entered the shop pretending to be there to buy cigarettes. As the shop owner assisted them, another man entered and pointed a gun at him, demanding money. "The [shop owner] gave an undisclosed amount of cash to him and all three ran out of the shop, fleeing the scene in a VW Golf. The incident was reported to law enforcement officials who were in the vicinity," Van Wyk said. They responded to the incident and managed to apprehend the four not far from the scene. The money, gun and ammunition were recovered. The men are expected to appear in the Bellville Magistrate's Court soon, Van Wyk said.
