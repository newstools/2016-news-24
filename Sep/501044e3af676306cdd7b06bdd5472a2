	     Bloemfontein – “I am begging for mercy. I am very sorry for what I have done,” a woman who gave her ten-year-old son a heroin-filled syringe to inject himself so they could “meet up again in heaven” told the court. The 37-year-old woman was found guilty of attempted murder by regional magistrate Jan Greyvenstein on Wednesday, Netwerk24 reported. She had admitted guilt earlier. According to her plea agreement she had also injected herself with heroin.  On October 2, 2015, she visited her son in a place of safety in Bloemfontein. He was crying and said he was being bullied.  “I was hurt because I had lost my son. I pulled heroin into the syringe and put it on his bed. I injected myself and told him to do the same so that we could be reunited in heaven.” She then left and woke up somewhere else. Someone took her to hospital. She said she knew that you could die from injecting heroin. Previously, she had been found guilty of housebreaking, theft and fraud. In 2008 she was sentenced to three years in jail. Her sentencing on the attempted murder charge was postponed until a report could be compiled on the effects of the incident on the child. The boy is in the care of family members in Cape Town. He was in court on Wednesday and was allowed to see his mother in the presence of a social worker and a police officer. “He was so happy to see me that he nearly knocked me over,” she said.
