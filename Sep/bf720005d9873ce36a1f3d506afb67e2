He was physically examined, a court proceeding was made to us, a psychological assessment was done and a psychosocial report was compiled," Xalisa said.The report further stated that no psychiatric diagnosis was provided and given Zinde's history of previous medical attention and substance abuse; it would not have a bearing on his fitness to stand trial.&ldquo;The accused is capable of understanding court proceedings so as to contribute meaningfully to his defence. At the time of the alleged offense, the accused did not suffer from mental disorder or mental defect that affected his ability to distinguish between the rightful and wrongful nature of his deeds,&rdquo; said Xalisa.Bail applicationZinde's defence lawyer, Francois Joubert, opposed portions of the report indicating that at the time the offense was committed he was not in the correct state of mind.&ldquo;We are only opposing Part D of the report. That would be at the time the offense was committed because his mental health was in such a condition that he couldn't be held responsible," said Jourbet.The matter was postponed to September 16 for formal bail application.The 23-year-old was arrested in connection with his mother's murder in June. Her body was found in the boot of her Range Rover at her home in the Pecanwood Estate, Hartbeespoort, on Saturday, June 11, after a family friend went looking for her. Drugs and a 10kg weight covered in blood were found in the home, police said at the time. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
