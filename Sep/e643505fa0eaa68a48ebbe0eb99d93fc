However, she said the treatment given to patients by a sangoma never includes any form of sexual penetration.Describing how the rape by Ndawonde made him feel, one victim said he &ldquo;felt like committing suicide&rdquo;.&ldquo;I felt like I had a burden on my shoulders that was too heavy to carry. I felt like I was nothing since Siyabonga abused me &hellip; I cannot face other people because what he did to us is known all over the community.&rdquo;Another said he wished he could commit suicide because he no longer sees a bright future. &ldquo;I was also afraid I might be infected with sexually transmitted diseases, because he never used a condom for protection.&rdquo;The victim said he had trusted Ndawonde because he was a traditional healer and most of them &ldquo;do not do bad things&rdquo;.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
