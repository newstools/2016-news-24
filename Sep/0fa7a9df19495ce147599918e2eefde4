"When the person got closer he saw the pigeon's feet were tied together with a strip of black plastic," Beverley Rademeyer's Animal Anti-Cruelty &shy;League (AACL) told Netwerk24.She said the bird's beak and claws had been coloured in&nbsp;with red, and that a blue circle had been drawn around its eye."In my 15 years here, I've never seen anything like this. It is simply cruel; the worst kind of animal abuse."AACL volunteer Karien van Schalkwyk said the pigeon, otherwise,&nbsp;seemed to be healthy.The AACL has asked the public to help find the perpetrators. "We don't know if it is someone's idea of a sick joke or if this is a racing pigeon who lost a race and his owner took revenge," Van Schalkwyk said. Shane Gerber, a board member of the South African National Pigeon Organisation, said they were shocked by the incident. "I can't confirm it is a carrier pigeon, but it is not ringed. That would have made things much easier."Anyone with information about the incident can call the AACL on 041 456 1776. &nbsp; A strip of black plastic from a rubbish bag was tied to the pigeon's feet.
