He was on his way to see his family for Christmas.The family opened a case of culpable homicide against Mahlobo and his VIP guards.Nhleko said the case docket was first referred to a senior public prosecutor for a decision on whether to prosecute or not.On July 21, the prosecutor sent the docket back to police with certain requests, the ministry said in the reply to DA MP Ken Robertson&rsquo;s question.It was returned to the prosecutor the next day, who then asked for a further report from a forensic expert. "On 26 August 2016, the report of the forensic expert was received and the case docket handed back to the senior public prosecutor for a decision on prosecution. This decision has not been made and the case docket is currently still with the senior public prosecutor."Robertson asked why the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) had not investigated the matter.Nhleko replied that the VIP driver was not an SAPS member. There was also no indication of any police negligence or unprocedural handling of the investigation that could warrant Ipid&rsquo;s involvement.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
