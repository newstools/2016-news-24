He was 51.Whereas many of his contemporaries focused on a relatively narrow repertoire, the South African felt at home in operas ranging from Puccini to Wagner. Over a nearly 30-year career, he appeared on most of the world's top stages including La Scala, the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, New York's Metropolitan Opera and the State Opera in Vienna, where he made his home.Elisabetta Hartl of Medea Music and Entertainment Group, which worked with Botha, gave no details in announcing his death, but Botha had been suffering from cancer.Uncommonly versatile, Botha shone in roles ranging from Florestan in Beethoven's Fidelio to main figures in works by Verdi, Wagner, and Richard Strauss.

Tenor Michael Schade called Botha "one of the greatest voices that I ever got to share the stage with." Kasper Holten, director of the Royal Opera in London, said: "So sad to hear of Johan Botha's death," which baritone Thomas Hampson called a "huge loss for the opera world."Born August 19 1965, in Rustenburg, Botha studied singing at an early age, notching some local successes before starting his world career - at first as a choir member at the Bayreuth Festival.His breakthrough came in 1993 when he appeared at the Opera Bastille in Paris as Pinkerton in Puccini's Madama Butterfly. Roles at other major European houses soon followed.Botha is survived by his wife and two sons.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
