This generation must return us to the correct path,&rdquo; he said at a graduation ceremony at the University of Venda.&ldquo;Our principles have been eroded. Where our symbols have been co-opted, the generation represented here must restore the founding values of our nation.&rdquo;He called on them to replicate the leadership qualities former president Nelson Mandela and other leaders of his generation embodied. They should emulate their discipline, humility, selflessness, kindness, and commitment to serving others.He criticised the burning and destruction of property at tertiary institutions.Unlike other institutions of higher learning, the university managed to avoid student protests against fee increases.Deputy vice-chancellor academic, Professor Jan Crafford, said they did so by engaging robustly with students and developing a financial aid strategy.Ramaphosa praised students for not joining in the violence, for refusing to destroy their future, and instead imagining and trying to create a different society.&ldquo;This is a generation that does not accept that the wilful and senseless destruction of property is a legitimate response to discontent and dissatisfaction.&rdquo;The university awarded him an honorary law doctorate for his role in crafting the country&rsquo;s Constitution.President Jacob Zuma congratulated Ramaphosa.&ldquo;The deputy president played a leading role in the drafting of the Constitution of the republic and in ensuring a smooth transition of our country from apartheid to the democratic dispensation we enjoy today.
