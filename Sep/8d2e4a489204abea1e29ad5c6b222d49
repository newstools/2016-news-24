If you were to take a minute to reflect on your life, would you say you re pleased with it or not? Regardless, whether you do so or not, in that space of time, a man has achieved something while another has not.Clearly, that says a lot about the importance of time, let alone its use.I ve been told many times that I should be careful how I spend time.This was absolute nonsense to me until life s hardship fell on me, and that was just the moment I needed to highlight what I ve been told by those older than myself.All that taught me to value self introspection, so that I spend no time minding other peoples businesses more than my own. Quite frankly, whether we like it or not, people always have themselves to blame for their misfortunes.Others are misled to their misdeeds.Nonetheless, what am I going on about, one might ask. Well, its simple, respect time as we are never afforded it again. While you gossip, the other person is celebrating their achievements.And, while you criticize how others make a living, be it good or bad, they make sure that they don t sleep on an empty stomach. Not that they d be provided for, come to think of it.See the unseen because time awaits no man whose life has no direction.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
