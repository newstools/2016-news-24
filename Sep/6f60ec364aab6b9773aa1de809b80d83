It remains a situation we are looking at, but at this stage we have our finger on the pulse."ANC MP Angelinah Molebatsi said the appointment of Phahlane, and the support&nbsp;he had received, had&nbsp;brought huge changes.&nbsp;Phiyega is suspended pending an inquiry into her fitness to hold office. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
