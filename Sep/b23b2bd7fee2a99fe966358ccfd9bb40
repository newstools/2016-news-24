That will then put the NPA into chaos,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;It is her (Jiba&rsquo;s) right to do so, but in my view, even if they take the matter on appeal it doesn&rsquo;t change that there is a pronouncement by the court,&rdquo; Nxasana told News24.The High Court in Pretoria ruled on Thursday that&nbsp;Jiba, the deputy national director of public prosecutions, and Lawrence Mrwebi, special director of public prosecutions,&nbsp;had brought the NPA and legal profession into disrepute by failing to prosecute former police crime intelligence head Richard Mdluli.They should have stood "firm and vigorous" and persisted with their prosecution of Mdluli on fraud and corruption charges.Judge Francis Legodi ordered their names struck off the roll of advocates. Jiba's lawyer Zola Majavu said she would appeal.The General Council of the Bar&nbsp;brought a case against them because of their handling of cases including Mdluli&rsquo;s, the prosecution of President Jacob Zuma on corruption charges, and of suspended KwaZulu-Natal Hawks head Johan Booysen.Nxasana said it was sad to see the courts intervening in a matter he had raised long before he left office in June last year.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
