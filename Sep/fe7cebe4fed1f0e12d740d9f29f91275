KwaZulu-Natal, for trying to upgrade cellphone
contracts with fake Rica documents, police said on Saturday. The four
had allegedly been using fake documents, including bogus IDs with different
photos, to upgrade to the latest devices at cellphone companies in Glencoe,
Dundee, Newcastle and Ladysmith, Captain Nqobile Gwala said. They
will be charged with forgery and making false documents and presenting them as
the real thing. In terms
of South African law, cellphone numbers can only be issued upon presentation of an ID and proof of
residence. These details are registered with the number in line with the
Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of
Communication-related Information Amendment Act. The act was introduced to
enable authorities to intercept and monitor as part of efforts to combat crime.
It is usually not possible to get a contract or a device, or buy a SIM card without
being ''Rica-ed". Gwala
said police would profile the group, all from Johannesburg, to see if they can
be linked to other cases. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
