I was a part of Queen For A Day about two years ago and it just makes this experience so much more special for me, being their Queen, she said.Momberg has a special love for children and is also actively involved in several charities. Being involved in Queen For A Day allowed her to experience both in a combined setting.The RFAD team went out of their way to make the girls feel special on that day. After arriving, they each received a pink T-shirt with the message blah, blah, princess this, princess that! Queen is queen and that s that on the back.Following a short photo shoot, they were then treated to an hour of pampering, which involved a foot spa, make-up and nail painting sessions. We tell them all that they look beautiful no matter what, said Michelle van Huyssteen, Port Elizabeth Branch Manager RFAD.Most, if not all, of the items that made the day extra special were sponsored by The Plantation Wedding Venue, Cupcake Love PE, The Majestic Princesses, who did the make-up leg of the pampering session and Johan Wolmarans, who sponsored Rochelle s dress.All of these elements combined to give the girls a Spring Fiesta-themed day to make them feel beautiful and special.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
