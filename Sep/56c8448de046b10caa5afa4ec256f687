Officers became aware of his plight while conducting a drunk-driving blitz in nearby Manenberg on Sunday.While they were at a police station there they happened to hear a Bangladeshi man telling police that his friend had been kidnapped. Metro police went to the location where the man said his friend was being held and they found&nbsp;him in a bad state after having been severely assaulted.He was freed, but opted not to go to hospital straight away. Police arrested three people shortly afterwards and another on a bit later.One of the people arrested&nbsp;was South African, two were Bangladeshi, and the fourth&nbsp;was from Pakistan.A demand for a ransom of around R800 000 had been made for his release.&nbsp;It was still&nbsp;not yet clear why the man was targeted.All four of those arrested were charged with kidnapping. Member of the mayoral committee for safety and security JP Smith said it&nbsp;was rare for metro police to get involved in kidnapping cases, but it was all in a day's work for the officers who had to be able to handle anything that came their way.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
