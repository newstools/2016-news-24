"It is reasonably believed that the fish in that lake is likely to be contaminated and not suitable for human consumption," said department spokesperson Mondli Mvambi. "The people of Bethlehem should desist from eating the fish caught in this lake and any other food items that are harvested from non-certified and approved food outlets." Environmental officers had been sent to investigate. The cause of the fish deaths was unknown. Mvambi said the department was worried about residents who were seen collecting the fish. "We are disturbed by the number of people that showed up to collect the fish. We called the police to intervene because this could result in a serious health hazard," said Mvambi. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
