The owners of the economy and land remain those who gained ownership of wealth through dispossession and the barrel of the gun."Vavi said the ANC-led government had undermined all the progressive policies it should have implemented by adopting neo-liberal economic policies and lacking the political will to address questions of poverty, inequality, unemployment and corruption.He said the scourge of corruption went hand in hand with a neo-liberal economic agenda."The whole fiasco about privatisation and tendering opened up the doors for the most unscrupulous tenderpreneurs to emerge as millionaires overnight, and then be congratulated for de-racialising business through phoney BEE deals." The unwillingness to tackle unemployment, poverty, inequalities and corruption was witnessed by South Africans on a daily basis, he said. However, the responsibility for "normalising" corruption lay with the country's current national leadership, he said.He called on workers not to allow the trend to continue during the ANC's upcoming 2017 elective congress."We cannot afford a repeat of this fiasco in the coming 2017 round of public sector negotiations."All the Cosatu unions will be so preoccupied about who becomes the next leader of the ANC and how this next gang will distribute patronage and how the new generation of leaders...will gain materially from this change or no change of ANC leadership."The workers still suffering from years of neglect will be the last thing on their minds," Vavi said.The working class was currently faced with the deepest crisis it had experienced since the overthrow of apartheid, he said.More than 20 years after the birth of the country's democracy, there were still high levels of unemployment, the absence of basic infrastructure for large sections of the population, crises in both the education and health services, as well as levels of inequality that should have stayed in the past.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
