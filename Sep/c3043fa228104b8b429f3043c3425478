The Tripoli-based GNA is opposed by an internationally recognised parliament based in Libya's remote east near the border with Egypt.Haftar, 73, who sees himself as Libya's saviour after battling jihadists out of most of second city Benghazi in the east, backs the parliament which has refused to grant the GNA a vote of confidence.The Brega takeover comes hours after the United States and its major European allies - which back the GNA - condemned Haftar's offensive, echoing remarks by UN special envoy Martin Kobler."I call for the respect of UN Security Council Resolution 2259 which recognises the Government of National Accord... as the sole executive authority in Libya," Kobler said Monday.Oil is Libya's main natural resource with reserves estimated at 48 billion barrels, the largest in Africa, but production has plummeted since 2011 as the country plunged into chaos.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
