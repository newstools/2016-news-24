It had already been dehorned. Rhinos are targeted for their horn, which is powdered down and used in traditional Asian medicine.One of those arrested in connection with the Erindi reserve poaching is understood to be a former police officer.This latest killing takes the number of known rhino fatalities in Namibia to 38 so far this year.In 2015, Namibia lost 125 rhino to poachers, according to the New Era newspaper.South Africa lost around 1 200 in the same period. Neighbouring Zimbabwe - which has a smaller rhino population of around 700 - lost around 50.&nbsp;The authorities there have embarked on an ambitious programme to dehorn all rhinos living in the country's national parks, News24 reported this week.&nbsp;A senior ecologist for Zimbabwe's national parks authority Colum Zhuwawo told Wednesday's official Herald newspaper that a side-effect of South Africa's ramped-up efforts to protect its rhinos from poachers "could make Zimbabwe [rhinos] a target." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
