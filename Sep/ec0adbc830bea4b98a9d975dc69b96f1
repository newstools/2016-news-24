Over 630 pets from our community were vaccinated. The rabies vaccination clinic was a follow-up to the first clinic the SPCA started in June 2012 following the dramatic increase in positive rabies cases at that time, and is hosted every year at the SPCA.Rabies vaccinations need to be done annually to ensure the vaccine remains effective, and thereby not only protects your companions, but also your family and community. The SPCA advises that pet owners speak to their veterinarians to ensure their pets are up to date and how to manage the process. - Supplied.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
