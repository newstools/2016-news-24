When miners were not paid, local businesses struggled to survive and workers were often forced to take out loans which they struggled to repay.Submissions would be made by the Department of Rural Development, the Chamber of Mines, various municipalities and mining companies. The hearings were intended to identify policies, regulations, and other interventions to help those affected.Hearings would be held on Monday and Wednesday. On Monday there would be submissions from the department, the Chamber of Mines, the Emakhazeni, Victor Khayne and Emalahleni local municipalities (all in Mpumalanga), the Mtubatuba local municipality in KwaZulu-Natal, and from companies Mbuyelo Group, Wescoal Mining, and Petmin.Earlier this month, City Press reported that at the previous round of hearings, the SAHRC heard allegations of mining companies not sustaining the rights of communities and of a lack of effective government intervention.Mining Affected Communities United in Action (Macua) made a submission in which they alleged that water near mining activities had become polluted and unsafe for human consumption, and that companies were not being held to account.Macua represents 100 communities through 70 organisations.The panel would compile a report after all hearings have concluded.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
