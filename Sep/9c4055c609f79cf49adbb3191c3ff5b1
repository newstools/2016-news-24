While rage may help as a tactic, it should not be construed as viable strategy for sorting students&rsquo; fees problems.&rdquo;President Jacob Zuma established the Commission of Inquiry into Higher Education and Training (fees commission) in January, to look into the feasibility of providing free higher education.It is chaired by former Supreme Court of Appeal judge Jonathan Heher, assisted by advocates Gregory Ally and Leah Khumalo.Its terms of reference include looking at the financial sustainability and institutional autonomy of universities, and assessing the roles government, universities, the private sector, and students should play in funding higher education.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
