One of the occupants presented a knife and attacked one of the paramedics. He [the paramedic] sustained wounds to his face and hands before a member of the public stepped in and disarmed the knife wielding man,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When another ER24 emergency vehicle arrived on the scene, after the paramedic was stabbed, the suspect ran across the road and returned with a brick and attempted to further assault the ER24 crew on scene. One of the paramedics managed to disarm the suspect,&rdquo; Bodasing added. She said that when police arrived the knife-wielding man was detained. &ldquo;The injured paramedic received several stitches to his face and hand at a nearby Mediclinic. He also sustained several bruises. He is currently doing well and will be supported by the company where needed,&rdquo; she said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
