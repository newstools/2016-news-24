Parliament said it found the reasons for the strike unconvincing and said it was not notified of it.&ldquo;The action is unprotected and staff are cautioned against committing misconduct by participating in such action. In instances where misconduct is committed, disciplinary action will be taken and this may lead to dismissal,&rdquo; the institution said in a statement.The National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union-affiliated employees downed tools on Thursday, following a week of lunchtime protests.This was due to salary deductions, the suspension of branch chairperson Sthembiso Tembe, and the disciplinary processes against six employees.They wanted Parliament to stop &ldquo;no work, no pay&rdquo; salary deductions following last year&rsquo;s unprotected strike; to lift the suspension of two shop stewards; and the withdrawal of disciplinary charges against six employees.Parliament said it was inconceivable for due process against the employees to be withdrawn or cancelled for no legitimate reason.Unprocedural&ldquo;Such an action would not only be unfair and unprocedural, but would also liquidate the legitimacy of due process.&rdquo;Employees had recourse to internal processes if they felt management had been unfair.&ldquo;Therefore embarking on strike over these issues, without exhausting internal avenues and despite available resolution mechanisms, as provided for in law and policy, is especially wrong.&rdquo;Workers said they would continue striking until the Nehawu leaders&rsquo; suspension had been lifted.&ldquo;Charge one, charge all,&rdquo; they chanted outside Parliament on Thursday.Tembe told workers they did not want to disrupt the business of Parliament, but wanted action.Parliament said it was available to hold talks with Nehawu to find solutions to the workers&rsquo; grievances.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
