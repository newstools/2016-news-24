The rest is yours. You must go back and fight. We can't fight for you&hellip; we regard it as a Zimbabwean problem," Geingob was quoted as saying.Good leadership qualities&nbsp;Geingob's remarks came just less than a week after Botswana&rsquo;s leader Ian Khama urged Mugabe to step aside. Khama said Zimbabwe needed new leadership to deal with a political and economic implosion that has dragged down the whole of southern Africa since 2000.He said that the long-time ruler would not be able to solve the southern African country&rsquo;s woes. "It is obvious that at his [Mugabe's] age and the state Zimbabwe is in, he's not really able to provide the leadership that could get it out of its predicament."They have got plenty of people there who have got good leadership qualities who could take over," Khama was quoted as saying at the time. Following the remarks by Khama, one of President Mugabe&rsquo;s aides, Information Minister Chris Mushowe, said Khama&rsquo;s sentiments were "taboo in African etiquette and diplomatic parlance"."The government of Zimbabwe is shocked by this uncharacteristic behaviour of president Khama, who until last month was at the helm of SADC, and should know better that you don&rsquo;t use the media platform to criticise fellow SADC leaders as he has just done with President Mugabe."It is a taboo in African etiquette and diplomacy," Mushowe was quoted as saying.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
