Earlier this year two students were expelled after a plea-bargaining process."They are appealing the sanction and so the final outcome is not yet determined," the university said.It said it had an interdict in place against three students."The interdict was applied for and granted by a judge on the grounds that this was necessary to protect the campus community and property. This is subject to an appeal to be heard in the Supreme Court of Appeal on 29 September 2016."It maintained that the tribunal and interdicts, which involved five students, was not a tactic to undermine protest. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
