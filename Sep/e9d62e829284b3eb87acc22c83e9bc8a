A photographer was also hit in the face with a plank-like object."Tsedu said journalists were only doing their jobs "for the benefit of society" and posed no threat to anyone."Yesterday's incidents are in line with a discomforting trend we have noticed where journalists become targets of private security while covering public protests. Sanef has raised its concerns with the University Vice Chancellor Dr Ihron Rensburg, who condemned the actions and promised to ensure the security teams respect the right of journalists to do their work.&rdquo;Sanef has also condemned the hostility of student leaders to journalists and called on them to open channels of communication with media houses if they feel aggrieved by the coverage.Student leaders have also been encouraged to use available mechanisms such as the Press Ombudsman and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission to get redress.eNCA intern Thapelo Leshope attacked by private securities at #UJ Doornfontein. #Fees2017 #FeesMustFall pic.twitter.com/gLMJYUR2ce24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
