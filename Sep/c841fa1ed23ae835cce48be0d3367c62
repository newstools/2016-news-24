 CAPE TOWN - Watch as South African MPs debate the state of the country's coffers during a question and answer session  in the National Assembly.Later on the agenda, The National Assembly will vote on Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane's candidacy as the new Public Protector, before her nomination is sent to President Jacob Zuma for approval. Scroll down to watch proceedings live from Parliament. Ministers fielding questions from the floor included Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan and others from the economic cluster. "Clearly Madam Speaker if you want the economy to grow you want to inspire confidence," Gordhan said in reply to a question from an opposition MP. Gordhan added that growth in local investment and FDI (foreign direct investment) was "crucial to ensure that we project a national front in respect of ratings agencies". The sitting on South Africa's economic outlook took place the same day as a parliamentary vote on shortlisted Public Protector nominee Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane (in a separate gathering). Gordhan discussed the definition of a recession and listed some of the areas in South Africa’s economy that were enjoying relative fiscal stability. He also emphasized the need for political stability. "We need to get the politics right in this country." The Minister of Finance, who has been mired by repeated calls to meet with the Hawks over his involvement in a "rogue" unit at SARS, also fielded questions on banking. David Maynier of the DA asked Gordhan about the termination of financial institutions’ support for Oakbay Holdings, a company well-known for being linked to the Guptas (the family announced a plan to sell thei stake in the company in late August). Gordhan replied, "I don't think anybody in this house belonging to any political party wants to talk this country into a recession, and I am talking to Honourable Maynier."
