The difference between the two types of universities must be addressed and the gap closed to ensure that the quality of education provided is the same across all institutions of higher learning."The commission took exception to the organisation's accusations regarding these two universities, saying they do indeed deliver quality graduates and also do good work.The organisation responded by saying funding at these two universities was not at the same level as that allocated to other universities.The YCLSA said while free education for the poor was an immediate demand, free education for all was a focus point in the future."Though there has been undisputed progress in education transformation, we believe there has been a deliberate stalemate by the government in introducing free quality compulsory education at the cost of the poor."According to the YCLSA, National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) bursaries alone aren't helping the situation and send students into the working world with debt due to unemployment rates.Call for fee increase freeze"In South Africa the provision of NSFAS to poor students has proven to be a key intervention from government though its results are not satisfactory. However, the loan system of NSFAS has led to many black graduates being in debt after completing school. The students fall victim to unpaid loans which go on for years given the unemployment rate."It also said NSFAS should gradually phase out loans and only offer bursaries.It called for universities not to raise costs while the issue surrounding free education was still being investigated."While still in the process of establishing how free education should be implemented the government must ensure that universities do not increase the fees for the coming academic years and measures are put in place to reduce the cost of learning." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
