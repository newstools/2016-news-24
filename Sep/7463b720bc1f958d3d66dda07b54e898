Tuesday's appointment of Major General Mohammed Ali el-Sheikh, who retired about 18 months ago, underlines the military's growing role in the running of the country since President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi, himself a career soldier, took office in June 2014. El-Sheikh replaces Khaled Hanafi, who quit last month amid corruption allegations. Prior to his retirement from active service, el-Sheikh was in charge of the military's supply network, which oversees the distribution of food, water and fuel to all units. Following his retirement, he took over the military's department running outlets selling food items at discount prices. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
