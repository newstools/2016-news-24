It is our conviction as the ANCWL that the matter has been laid to rest," she said.She called on members and supporters to continue working towards making the ANC a "more effective instrument for the liberation of our people and unreservedly defend the unity and integrity of the organisation".The Women&rsquo;s League also called for Zuma to address land ownership."It is high time that the economic freedom is achieved and the landless Africans get their land back which was stolen as far back as 1652. Landlessness and economic exclusion severely affect women of our country, in particular women of African origin," Matuba said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
