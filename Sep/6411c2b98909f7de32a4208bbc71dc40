The bullet penetrated both lungs and was found lodged against a rib bone,&rdquo; said Callealta.Nelson Mandela Bay was dubbed the Bottlenose Dolphin capital of the world in April this year by tourism authorities, who announced that the city would be hosting a dolphin festival each year to celebrate the international popularity of the species.&nbsp;&ldquo;Bayworld has received a number of reports from Seaview and Beachview residents in the past, claiming they had observed fishermen shooting at seals and dolphins from commercial vessels,&rdquo; the researchers said in a Facebook post yesterday.&ldquo;We have also retrieved bullets from a number of stranded seal carcasses over the past few years.&rdquo;It is common knowledge that there is conflict between marine mammals and fisheries at sea, but the extent of this is unknown and difficult to determine.&nbsp;&ldquo;Although fisheries interaction is the most likely cause of the death of the dolphin, it does not exclude the possibility of other scenarios,&rdquo; said Callealta.While bottlenose dolphins are not on the endangered list, they are protected under the Marine Living Resources Act, which clearly prohibits the killing, or attempted killing, of whales and dolphins.
