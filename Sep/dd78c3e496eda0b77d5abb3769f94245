I am still giving them [the] benefit of the doubt and hope they are busy doing the right thing," she told News24 after addressing the Cape Town Press Club as an SA First Forum (SAFF) member."But time is of the essence. I am counting down months. I will make a determination to see whether they are playing games or not."She hinted she might have another card up her sleeve. Not willing to talk about it at present, she said she "undertook another process" which would be revealed in time.Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi on Thursday evening confirmed that an inquiry, which involved Mentor&rsquo;s allegations, was still ongoing.Gupta influenceMentor made headlines earlier this year when she revealed more of the alleged influence the Gupta family had over the government.Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas and Mentor claimed the Guptas offered them Cabinet positions. The Guptas and their company Oakbay Investments have refuted the allegations countless times.Mentor said she called a police station commander earlier this year and asked if officers could be sent to her home because she didn&rsquo;t want to lay charges in the public eye.She made statements and laid charges against people and against institutions. She would not name the parties or go into more detail.In May, Hawks head Lieutenant General Berning Ntlemeza said reports that corruption charges had been laid against three ministers and the Gupta family were "baseless, malicious reports".He said the reports were aimed at discrediting Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown, Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies, and Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula.Ntlemeza said at the time they had received an affidavit from Mentor, which the anti-corruption unit was looking into.State capture probeMentor said on Thursday that the officers who came to her knew she was laying charges."When it reached the Hawks, it became an affidavit," she said.She was keeping an eye on the Public Protector&rsquo;s pending probe into allegations of state capture, which includes claims about the Guptas.Thuli Madonsela&rsquo;s office received a R1.5m funding commitment from National Treasury for the investigation."I suspect that the Public Protector investigation may bring to light a whole lot of things."At that point I will begin to speak freely again about what I think of the family and the extent to which the damage has been done in South Africa and whether that will continue or not."She was reluctant to comment on the Gupta family&rsquo;s recent announcement of their intention to sell all their shareholdings in South Africa by the end of the year."But we all know that even if they leave, they have their stooges and their people who do work for them. That is all I am willing to say."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
