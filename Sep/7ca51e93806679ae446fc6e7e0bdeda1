WATCHCape Town - The pair accused of the murder of Stellenbosch University graduate Carl Schoombie are set to go on trial in October.Juane Jacobs and Brent Henry appeared in the Western Cape High Court on Friday for a pre-trial conference.Schoombie and three friends were on their way home from a Claremont nightclub when he was dragged from his Uber and beaten. He was admitted to hospital in a coma but died a few days later.The two assailants were said to have been at the club, Tiger Tiger, and accused the victims of having started a fight earlier that night, police Captain FC van Wyk told News24 at the time of the incident.National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said Jacob's attorney, William Booth, had requested that his client see a psychiatrist before standing trial."They have tried to get one organised by the prison without success. He also indicated that his client hasn't been getting medication for his serious illness," he said."He [Booth] opposed that the date for trial has been set as October 17 as he argued that outcome of sessions with the psychiatrist might have an impact on the date for trial. The court disagreed and kept the date," Ntabazalila added.He said that the legal representative for Henry indicated that his client was not aware of the arrangement for a psychiatrist and that they were ready for trial.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
