Last year rhino poaching fatalities countrywide were particularly serious, with around 50 killed. There are around 700 black and white rhinos in Zimbabwe.The hope is that rhinos breeding will at least mitigate some of the losses to poaching.&nbsp;But in ideal conditions a female rhino can only produce a calf every 30-36 months, Leathem says. Lions have a much higher rate of reproduction.Bubye has more than 500 lions. The population has grown from just 24 lions just eighteen years ago, a clear indication, Leathem says,"of just how lion can recover and reproduce if given space, adequate protection from humans and abundant prey species."Efforts are being made to see if some of the conservancy's lions can be translocated. Rwanda, Malawi and Zambia have all been mentioned as possible destinations. Lions are very difficult to move into areas that already have lions.Says Leathem: "There are no definite takers for lions yet but we are still hoping that there might be some suitable areas that will want [lions] next year."Zimbabwe's lion population has been in the spotlight since the killing of Cecil the Lion just outside Hwange National Park last year. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
