All the major dams in the province, with the exception of the Clanwilliam dam, are still very far from ideal levels. &ldquo;These include the Vo&euml;lvlei dam (currently 69% full), the Theewaterskloof dam (53%) and the Brandvlei dam (57%). The Clanwilliam dam is currently 100% full and is the one highlight&rdquo;, he said. The Cape Town system dams were at 61% capacity, compared to last year&rsquo;s 73%.The Berg River catchment was at 72% (71% last year), Breede River catchment 57% (105%), Gouritz River catchment 40% (66%), and the Olifants/Doorns River catchment 99% (88%).Bredell urged the public to use water sparingly to allow dam levels to recover before summer.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
