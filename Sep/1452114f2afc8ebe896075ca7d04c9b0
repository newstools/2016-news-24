Police were called and students were allowed to go in.The Student Representative Council criticised university management for calling in police and making use of private security.&ldquo;This shows how the universities use their autonomy to silence communities. The large portion of the university community is students, yet they want us to say, 'Yes ma'am, yes baas', but this is our movement,&rdquo; Mkhari said.Mkhari said students felt uncomfortable sharing information on their plans, as it was being used against them.&ldquo;Once we do so, we will find police there and we won&rsquo;t be able to move forward with our plans,&rdquo; he said.Police were visible at Wits during the day&rsquo;s protests, including on its education and medical school campuses.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
