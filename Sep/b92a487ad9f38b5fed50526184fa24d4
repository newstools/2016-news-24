"Professor [Mandla] Makhanya you must do like your peers at UCT and University of Pretoria and close the university until the minister of higher education adheres to the needs of the students," EFF student command president Mpho Morolane said on Monday."All we want is free quality education now. It must happen now and not be postponed."Morolane was part of a group of students who marched through the Pretoria CBD shutting down technical and vocational education and training [Tvet] colleges as they made their way to Unisa.He said failure to close down the institution would see students returning with a vengeance and in larger numbers.The university's Professor Somadoda Fikeni addressed the students and said management would meet to deliberate on the matter and respond accordingly."We have received your message and we understand the importance of the occasion. Management will be meeting to communicate on what has been conveyed in this meeting then we will communicate the outcome," he said.Marolane told students to disperse but warned the university not to test their might."Tomorrow if it happens...hell will break loose," said Morolane. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
