The city's estimated legal costs have already reached at least R20m," said De Lille.She said the company should accept that it had followed an improper and unlawful process and if it had not been challenged, would have cost Western Cape road users R62bn in toll fees over a period of 30 years.Earlier, the court ruled that the application for leave to appeal against the refusal to admit further affidavits was dismissed with costs, including the costs of two counsel.Sanral had appealed a judgment over the right to toll the N1 and the N2 highways in August, which had been in favour of the City of Cape Town.No Johannesburg 'mess' in Cape TownREAD: Sanral vs Outa: More than 15000 say SA should continue 'to fight e-tolls'On September 30 2015 the Western Cape High Court reviewed and set aside approvals that would enable Sanral to go ahead with tolling those highways in the Winelands district."The SCA declared the 2014 decision of the Sanral Board to declare certain sections of the N1 and N2 as toll roads to be invalid and it was reviewed and set aside. In addition, the SCA dismissed Sanral's appeal with costs," said De Lille.De Lille said the city again extends its invitation to Sanral to meet and discuss the most affordable option for road maintenance and upgrades in the City of Cape Town."The mess that Sanral caused in Johannesburg will not be allowed to happen in Cape Town," said De Lille.Transport MEC Brett Heron said Sanral's "secretive" plans to toll the Winelands route would have had far-reaching consequences for the public and future generations.Local residents and visitors would have had to pay tariffs nearly three times that of the controversial Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project's toll roads."If Sanral is now proposing to toll other areas that are governed by the DA they are going to have to work differently because those judges are now on high alert," said Herron. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
