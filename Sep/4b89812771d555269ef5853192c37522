PDP spokesperson, Jacob Mafume claimed that Mugabe had failed to reign in on corruption because he was also deeply involved in unfair distribution of resources. He said that this was a direct contravention of Section 293 subsection 2 of the country's constitution, which stated that: "the state may not alienate more than one piece of agricultural land to the same person and his or her dependents."Mafume's accusations came just a week after a Zimbabwean white farmer was sentenced to 12 months in jail after refusing to comply with a directive to move out of his farm at the height of the country&rsquo;s controversial land reform programme.Phillip Valentine, 40, was reportedly dragged before magistrate Poterai Gwezhira to face a charge of contravening the gazetted land act.Valentine was sentenced to 12 months in jail or pay a $600 fine.Reports indicated that the veteran leader and his Zanu-PF party launched the land reforms in 2000, taking over white-owned farms to resettle landless blacks.Mugabe said the reforms were meant to correct colonial land ownership imbalances.At least 4 000 white commercial farmers were evicted from their farms. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
