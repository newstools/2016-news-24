Zimbabwe has a dedicated driving school for women - and its founder says none of its clients has ever had a "serious" road accident.Some of the Tamiranashe (which means 'we have stood with God' in Shona) Women's College graduates are 80 years old, the state-owned Chronicle newspaper reported this weekend.This driving school, in Harare's outlying town of Norton, may be the answer to a recent controversial call for all drivers in Zimbabwe to re-sit their licence tests.Five people die in accidents on the country's roads &nbsp;each day, according to police figures from last year. The country has a population of 13 million.&nbsp;Highly disciplined divers&nbsp;Eight people were killed in a crash on the Bulawayo to Harare highway, last week. That accident was apparently caused by a burst tyre.&nbsp;The college's founder, Nancy Mbaura, knows something about working extremely hard to get her licence. According to the Chronicle, she only passed hers on her eighth attempt.That experience gave Mbaura a dream: to see more women becoming "well-groomed and highly disciplined drivers who are not a danger on the roads".&nbsp;The college has been running for five years."We keep records of those who would have eventually obtained a driver's licence," Mbaura, 40, was quoted as saying."In our records so far, we do not have a driver reported to have been involved in a serious road accident."International best practices&nbsp;The Zimbabwe Statistics Agency said earlier this year that "widespread disregard for [traffic] rules" plus "lack of competency by motorists" was fuelling the country's terrifying road death rate, the Herald newspaper reported in April.&nbsp;It was regularly alleged that it was possible to buy (or bribe one's way into getting) a drivers' licence. The Herald said the proposed re-sits would be "in line with international best practices".The Tamiranashe Women's College offers driving lessons for $5 a time, according to the Chronicle. That is cheaper than other driving schools, which sometimes charge up to $10 per lesson.The school is now so successful that it's even opened its (car) doors to men.*Learn to Drive with Jesus was the suggestion given for the name of a driving school in best-selling novelist Alexander McCall Smith's book, The Kalahari Typing School for Men.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
