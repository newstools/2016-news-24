The pupils were 90 minutes late.According to the education department, the pupils damaged cars on the premises, including that of the principal. The learners also allegedly threw stones at the police when they arrived.Schafer on Wednesday condemned the pupils for resorting to violence and destroying public property.Eight were arrested on charges of public violence and arson.Pupils also complained about not being allowed to wear synthetic hair or sport "creative" hairstyles.They claim that if their hair was styled and not cut short or in a standard ponytail, teachers would pour water on it and "mess it up".&lsquo;It&rsquo;s your hair&rsquo;Mayalo encouraged pupils, especially the girls, to "do what they like with their hair this weekend"."It's not about your hair; it's about the education you are entitled to. Your hair is yours. Your hair doesn't disturb education," he said."They must be allowed to feel pretty in their uniform. If teachers take issue [on Monday], we will make [the school] ungovernable."He said while Cosas condemned the vandalism of schools, they would be supporting the arrested learners when they appear in court on October 7."What they did was out of frustration," he said.All of the pupils, who have been released into their parents&rsquo; custody, are in Grade 8, with only one being in a more senior grade and legally an adult, Mayalo said.Schafer previously said the allegations listed in a memorandum were being investigated by district officials. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
