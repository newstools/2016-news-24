Paramedics need to be careful wherever they go,&rdquo; said Botha.ER24 spokesperson Chitra Bodasing Harduth said there had been three attacks on ER24 paramedics this year, and 15 over the last two years throughout the country.&ldquo;Attacks on EMS [emergency medical services] personnel have been going on for a long time,&rdquo; said Bodasing Harduth.&ldquo;Crimes committed against them started increasing a few years ago and attacks on our staff as well as all EMS personnel in general is of great concern. &ldquo;As EMS, their aim is to save as many lives as possible and it is shocking that the very same people who are dedicated to saving lives now find their lives at risk,&rdquo; she said.Bodasing Harduth said ER24 launched the Emergency Medical Support in Hostile Environments course in 2011 to address the spike in attacks on paramedics. &ldquo;This course is directly targeted at addressing concerns relating to violent crimes committed against EMS personnel,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;We teach our staff various skills, such as identifying hostile environments, how to deal with these situations and, if the need arises, how to defend themselves and the patient.&rdquo;She said they had launched an advanced course in 2014. KwaZulu-Natal EMS spokesperson Robert McKenzie said the increase in attacks on paramedics had been experienced nationwide, with many of the assaults happening in the Western Cape.&ldquo;Attacks are a constant threat and we ask the community to safeguard EMS staff and respect their lifesaving work,&rdquo; he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
