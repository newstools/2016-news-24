Kalisha.NaickerDRUNK, or rather drink driving , is a serious crime that is not taken as seriously as it should be.Alcohol use is involved in about 60% of our extremely high road death rate of 18 000 deaths per annum.Conviction rates of less than seven percent mean drivers often continue offending because they are not afraid of the repercussions of their actions, as they know that the chance of being caught again and tested is very low.Just because someone is found not guilty, does not mean they are innocent of the crime. Drink drivers often have dependency problems that need swift action to be taken.The fact that Dumisani Majola was arrested recently for drink driving, and then drove under the influence again when he kidnapped Mpiloh Ngwenya, raises the point once again of taking this crime seriously, of using evidential breathalysers, swift court appearances and the suspension of licences.South Africans Against Drunk Driving (Sadd) requests that an alcohol ignition lock is fitted so that drink drivers are not a danger to the other innocent road users. Sadd congratulates the South African Police Services for the swift recovery of little Mpiloh. CARO SMIT24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
