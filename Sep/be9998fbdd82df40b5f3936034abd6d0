Ping had asked for a recount in Haut-Ogooue province, where 95% of voters in the Bongo family stronghold were reported to have cast their ballots for the president on a turnout of more than 99%.The African Union said it had "taken note" of the court's verdict, as did the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.&nbsp;The European Union, which sent a monitoring mission to Gabon during the election, said in a statement on Saturday that its observers had been granted "very limited access" to the court review process, and that the Gabonese people had a legitimate right to question the integrity of the electoral process.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Responding to the criticism, Bongo told Al Jazeera he had little interest in the opinions of the international community."The international community does not cast a vote here, Gabonese people do. So, I am accountable to them," Bongo said.Long grip on power&nbsp;Gabon: Libreville reels as clashes erupt over voteBongo took over from his father, Omar, who ruled Gabon for 41 years until his death in 2009.Cameroon's President Paul Biya, who is 83 and has held office since 1982, wrote to Bongo on Monday voicing his "warm congratulations" and wishing him "success in the accomplishment of (his) new mandate."&nbsp; Senegal's President Macky Sall also congratulated Bongo, as did Alassane Ouattara, president of Cote d'Ivoire.&nbsp;"In the delicate period which Gabon is going through, I want to express to you my full encouragement and hope passionately that dialogue and calm will predominate between all the parties," Ouattara wrote in a statement. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
