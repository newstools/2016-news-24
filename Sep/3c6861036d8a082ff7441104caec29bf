Harare &ndash; Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF youths are set to clash on Wednesday after one of the factions within the party threatened to hold a massive demonstration against Local Government Minister Saviour Kasukuwere, a report said on Tuesday. According to NewsDay, Kasukuwere was being accused of extensive corruption in his previous portfolios as a minister.He was being accused stealing youth funds, community share ownership trust funds when he was the Youth minister, plunder of the country&rsquo;s wildlife when he took over the Water, Climate and Environment ministry, destruction of people&rsquo;s homes and giving out residential stands to his cronies and relatives when he was appointed local government minister.However, another faction vowed it would defend the embattled local government minister.Land meant for youths&nbsp;A&nbsp;New Zimbabwe&nbsp;report said that&nbsp;Kasukuwere allegedly dished out state-owned land to famous church leader Walter Magaya, adding that while he was the minister of youth, he secured a loan for his brother Tongai, who has since failed to settle it.&nbsp;Acting local government permanent secretary retired colonel J Mhakayakora said that it had become necessary for the ministry to shed light with the public on its plans. &nbsp;"Following adverse reports by both public and private media it has become necessary and imperative for the ministry to shed more light on the allocation of state-land in Harare and in other provinces," Mhakayakora was quoted saying.&nbsp;The march, dubbed Anti-Corruption Mega Demo, was due to start at the open space near the Harare Magistrates&rsquo; Court on Wednesday morning. The development came just a week after President Robert Mugabe reportedly grilled Kasukuwere over allegations that the land meant for youths had been sold to individuals.It remained to be seen whether the anti-corruption protest would take place, as a police ban imposed in the capital last month was reportedly still effective despite a High Court ruling last week. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
