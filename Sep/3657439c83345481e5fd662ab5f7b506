after she was hit in the head by a bullet
from a gun which was accidentally discharged at Shakaskraal Taxi Rank in
KwaZulu-Natal on Monday, paramedics said. IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson Paul Herbst said
the girl and a woman were injured while standing at the rank when the shooting
took place at around 07:00. According to Herbst, the young girl was in critical
condition and breathing with the help of a ventilator while the woman was being
treated for moderate facial injuries. Both patients were at the Stanger Hospital, Herbst
said. Paramedics were alerted to a shooting at the taxi
