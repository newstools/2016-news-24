These bags all contained abalone," Van Wyk said.The man was arrested and the contraband was seized."Officials from the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries were summoned to Lwandle police station where the abalone was counted. It amounted to 2 447 units of shucked abalone. It must still be weighed to determine the exact value, but was estimated at approximately R300 000." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
