And he has no idea of the quarrel he's started among Zimbabweans and Zambians!News24 Correspondent Harare - A Zimbabwean man says it's a miracle his dogs weren't killed when they bravely rushed in to save him from a leopard, a newspaper reported on Monday.Silent Dube, 19, was attacked from behind by a leopard in Hwange, western Zimbabwe on Friday, according to the state-controlled Chronicle newspaper.In an uncharacteristic attack, the leopard slashed Dube's face and went for his throat. Losing blood, Dube fought to keep the leopard from his neck. Then his dogs saw what was happening, the paper said.Dube was quoted as saying: "When my dogs saw me on the ground... they sprang to my defence." The dogs overpowered and eventually killed the leopard. It's not clear how many dogs there were - but Dube told the paper they'd only sustained minor scratches. He himself has been left nursing facial injuries. A local council official said Dube had his dogs to thank for his survival.A similar attack with similarly brave dogs was reported on in February last year, this time in the Bulilima district of south-western Zimbabwe. On that occasion there were seven dogs who saved owner Gift Moyo, 24, after he was attacked by a leopard that jumped down on him from a tree.It is rare for leopards to attack humans, but injured leopards and those that frequently raid livestock have been known to do this. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
