"We are happy to announce that we have now reached a point where we can continue with the project without the need for the permanent stop/go system along Main Road," Transport MEC Brett Heron said in a statement.The system has been the bane of the lives of commuters, and tourists visiting the pretty seaside town's famous fish restaurants and pubs. The stop-go system was implemented to put in new underground water mains, sewer pipes, stormwater pipes, street lighting, low-voltage cables, and fibre-optic infrastructure. It was difficult to do this work without restricting traffic to one lane. Herron said that, over the next 14 months, the transport department would: &middot; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reconstruct Main Road between the Kalk Bay Harbour entrance and Clovelly Road;&nbsp; &middot; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Make provision for parallel parking along the seaside; &middot; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Create footways for pedestrians on both the mountain- and sea-sides all the way from Woolley&rsquo;s Pool to the bridge: the walkway on the sea side will be between 3m and 5m wide to accommodate both pedestrians and cyclists, and the footway on the mountain-side will be approximately 1.5 m wide; &middot; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Refurbish the steps that lead to Woolley&rsquo;s Pool on the other side of the railway line.Delays reduced"The traffic delays will be significantly reduced once we cease the stop/go system. However, road users should still expect delays because they will be driving through a construction site with workers and machinery next to the traffic," he warned.&nbsp;"The speed limit along this section remains 40km/h. I sincerely thank the residents and visitors for their patience and support thus far, and request all to please keep on working with us in the months ahead," said Herron. Apart from the installation of the new underground services, the reinforced concrete retaining wall above the old Clovelly railway station has also been completed. "We have created a garden with indigenous plants between the retaining wall and Main Road which is visible from Fish Hoek beach and as you approach Kalk Bay from Clovelly Road. The retaining wall is still to be fitted with a handrail, as well as with a glass barrier along a short section where Metrorail&rsquo;s overhead electricity cables are in close proximity to the footway. Herron said it was&nbsp;hoped that the entire upgrading project would be completed ahead of schedule, before the summer holidays in December 17.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
