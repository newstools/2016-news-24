Mashaba said the project would only be instituted once all roads around the city had been tarred.&nbsp;"I was concerned to note that R70m has been set aside over the next three years for the development of bicycle lanes around our city. I intend putting a halt to this project. When every road in Johannesburg is tarred, maybe then we will look at bicycle lanes again." Mashaba lamented criticism by political opponents that he did not care about the poor. "This could not be further from the truth. I grew up in poverty. I remember having to drink water to stave off the hunger. "I know the plight of the poor; I understand and lived this plight and I can assure you this will be an administration which makes delivering to the poor and fighting poverty its top priority," he said.&nbsp; He said a new fleet for emergency medical service vehicles will be arriving in April next year to help at clinics. Mashaba was cheered by council members when he announced that there would no longer be co-operation between Johannesburg metro police and Sanral on e-tolls. "I have received a commitment from the JMPD [Johannesburg Metro Police Department] that there will be no harassment of our motorists about outstanding e-toll payments." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
