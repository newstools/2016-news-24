According to the statement, several journalists from various news organisations were intimidated while others were physically attacked by people claiming to have been protecting the ANC headquarters and leaders of the political party."Marshals clad in uMkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans' Association (MKMVA) regalia pushed and hurled abuse at journalists and there were also attempts to confiscate journalists' cameras.""Sanef also noted that journalists were pushed back and prevented from getting close to ANC officials, including secretary-general Gwede Mantashe, who came out to address the crowd and journalists as well," the statement read.The editors' forum said it was outraged and called on both the ANC and MKMVA to provide better training for their security staff and associates so that journalists can enjoy a free and safe environment to do their work unhindered by vulgar marshals.While Sanef has been highly critical of those who were said to be acting in the name of the ANC it had praise for the police."The behaviour of SAPS and JMPD members towards journalists was exemplary and Sanef commends them for enabling journalists to do their work."The organisation also noted that Monday's hostility towards members of the media follows several other cases in the lead up to the 2016 local government elections where journalists were either intimidated or assaulted as they covered public events. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
