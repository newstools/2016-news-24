He was, instead, required to "bring an independent mind to bear" when deciding whether to approve the proposal.Premature to grant an interdictThe SCA refused to grant the City of Cape Town&rsquo;s request that Sanral be interdicted from entering into a proposed concession contract regarding the toll roads.It said it would be premature to grant an interdict as there was no certainty regarding whether the roads would be tolled at all.On September 30 2015, the Western Cape High Court reviewed and set aside approvals that would enable Sanral to go ahead with tolling the highways in the Winelands district.City of Cape Town councillor Brett Heron said in a statement at the time that Sanral was appealing against that judgment, and that the City would defend its position.The City's stance was that, according to the Sanral Act, only the Sanral board could declare a toll road and that it failed to do this.Sanral previously said in a statement that there had been speculation and misinformation about the funding model to be used on the project.Its Western Cape regional manager, Kobus van der Walt, said the initial cost of works would be R10bn, R2bn short of Sanral's total allocation per annum.Van der Walt said the Western Cape was the only province that had permission from National Treasury to implement a fuel levy to finance roads, but had not implemented this.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
