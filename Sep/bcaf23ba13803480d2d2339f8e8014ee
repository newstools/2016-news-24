Hendricks asked if he needed help, before stabbing him in the collarbone with a knife.&nbsp;The court said he was lucky to be alive.Hendricks denied the crimes at first. After being convicted, he admitted to the attacks, but said his friends had placed rocks in the road.Judge Robert Henney said the matter, which attracted much interest, was one where &ldquo;retribution and deterrence should come to the fore&rdquo;.&lsquo;Road users fear N2 area&rsquo;&ldquo;It is a well-known fact that travelling on the N2 in the area in which incident took place, has instilled a sense of fear and anguish in road users about the prospect of being attacked.&rdquo;The road was an important link to outlying areas and other provinces.The public, businesses, public transport and especially tourists going to and from the airport, used it.Police stretched their resources to guard the road and there were even signs warning motorists of the danger.Henney said it was thus important to protect the road.Hendricks received 15 years&rsquo; imprisonment for aggravated robbery in the Holz incident, 10 years for aggravated robbery in the Loots incident, and five years each for malicious damage to their cars.These sentences would run concurrently with the life sentence.Hendricks stared straight ahead as the sentence was read out.Holz&rsquo;s wife, Rene, struggled to hold back tears and nodded at the court&rsquo;s decision. She did not want to speak to journalists, but said she was happy with the sentence.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
