Abram MashegoThe Ditsobotla Local Municipality in North West, famous for qualified audits, has &shy;appointed a university dropout to a senior &shy;accounting position.Disgruntled staff in the municipality, who asked not to be named for fear of &shy;victimisation, told City Press this week that Isaac Tsie was appointed Unit Manager &shy;Revenue Service in 2012, allegedly due to his political connections, although he was a Rhodes university dropout and had also &shy;presented an expired Association of Accounting technicians &shy;certificate.They are even more aggrieved now that he has been acting chief financial officer since &shy;December last year, even though he still has no relevant degree and &shy;expertise to do the job.City Press is in possession of his CV and certified academic transcripts of courses passed at tertiary institutions, which reveal that at the time he applied for the first post, he had dropped out of Rhodes University, where he was studying for a BCom accounting &shy;degree. He then registered with the University of South Africa and applied to have the courses he passed at Rhodes credited.Tsie cited Lengane Bogatsu &ndash; the former mayor of the municipality &ndash; as his reference. Municipal staff believed this was instrumental in his &shy;appointment.Two sources with knowledge of the affairs of the municipality told City Press that a service provider was hired to perform functions that were supposed to be Tsie&rsquo;s &shy;responsibility. Last year, North West provincial legislature&rsquo;s standing committee on public accounts, or Scopa, led by chairperson Mahlakeng Mahlakeng, had singled out the Ditsobotla Local Municipality management, warning them about their continued failure to improve their audit outcomes and their continued &shy;disregard of the Municipal Finance Management Act.The municipality was still among the worst performing municipalities this year, with the Auditor&shy;General&rsquo;s findings revealing that &shy;officials continued to misuse funds meant for service delivery, and an outstanding Eskom bill of R121 million.Municipal spokesperson Pius Batsile said according to their records, Tsie&rsquo;s qualifications were a higher diploma in taxation and a certificate in municipal finance management, but he could not say whether these qualifications were verified. The certificate is not in the CV that City Press has seen.&ldquo;Mr Tsie performed well during the interview, hence he was appointed to the position of revenue manager. &ldquo;He was also meeting all the &shy;requirements in terms of the skills, experiences, expertise and competencies required by the position,&rdquo; he claimed. Batsile said the municipality will investigate the allegation of favouritism, provided evidence is brought forward. He also confirmed that the &shy;suspended chief financial officer, Leeto Dintwe, who was Tsie&rsquo;s predecessor, was on suspension &shy;pending the &shy;finalisation of his &shy;disciplinary &shy;hearing.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
