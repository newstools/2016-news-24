The SA Human Rights Commission took it up with the department, saying the Immigration Act and its regulations allowed Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba to declare him an "undesirable" and block his entry to SA.A statement from Gigaba on Monday said that he noted their concerns, but Anderson could come to South Africa as long as he behaved himself.Baird said they would compile evidence of Anderson's tirades against gay people for handover to the minister on Friday for him to consider this matter further.Blogging about Albertyn, Szuszanna said her infertility was "self-inflicted" and added that she felt sorry for Albertyn's husband.Complaints about Africa"I'm sure eventually they went on to spay/neuter themselves to avoid such nasty accidents as a pregnancy in the future. Who knows, maybe they have divorced since, because like I said I have not been to her website in a couple of years."In another blog entry in 2008, she complains about aid donations from the US to Africa for IVF treatment for African women, stating that they were probably unable to conceive without IVF because their partners had infected them with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)."'Infections' is a nice way to say that these women have been rendered infertile by the STDs that run rampant in Africa, diseases that would almost certainly be passed on to the babies created through IVF."Sure, I feel bad that people live in a country where they were probably infected by their own parents, but do we need to continue that cycle of disease through sponsored IVF procedures?"Besides, maybe instead of handing out condoms like candy, these people should be taught not to live like animals and sleep with everyone and everything that moves."Comment from Albertyn was not immediately available, but she retorted on her blog on November 29 2011, that the woman had "secret fantasies about me".She continued: "Zsusie really hates IVF. And gays. And especially gays who do IVF. What do you think Zsusie would say if she knew that I helped many, many gay people become parents through egg donation, surrogacy and IVF!" 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
