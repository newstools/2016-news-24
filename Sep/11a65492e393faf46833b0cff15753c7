By the time a pregnant women becomes aware she is infected - if she notices at all - her baby's brain may already be damaged.In the macaque, the foetal brain stopped growing three weeks after infection, said the authors. Had it survived, the foetus would have developed microcephaly in one more month."This is likely similar to the late-onset microcephaly that is being reported now in some infants in Brazil that are born with a normal head size, but then the head no longer grows and meets criteria for microcephaly after several months," said Adams Waldorf.Mosquitoes are spreading the virus in seventy countries and territories, mainly the Americas and Caribbean, according to the WHO. Twelve countries have reported sexual transmission.Cases of microcephaly or other central nervous system malformations in babies have been recorded in 20 countries. Tests with other macaques are ongoing, the researchers said, also at earlier stages of gestation.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
