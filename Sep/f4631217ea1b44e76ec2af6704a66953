There are apparently no toilets at this camp.Some of the villagers have brought their cattle with them but are desperately trying to sell them off to raise funds, the report says.One of those living in the camp, Zacharia Mhlanga, 27, told the Manica Post that he'd last seen food donations in June."We used to cross back and collect food supplies but the situation is tense and we can't risk going back. Our food stocks are running dry and we had reports that our homes were burnt down by the bandits," the Manica Post quoted Mhlanga as saying.Renamo refused to accept the results of elections two years ago and is being blamed for attacks on homes, officials and major highways in central and northern Mozambique.In a recent report carried by Mozambican news agency AIM, a group of men who said they were members of Renamo raided homes, a hospital and official buildings in the Murrupula district of Nampula province in the last week of August.&nbsp;Villagers were ordered to flee into the bush. Renamo waged a 16-year war in Mozambique. It ended in 1992. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
