New members were also sworn in and adorned&nbsp;with the famous green blouse worn by members of the league. Madikizela-Mandela addressed the crowd after "Happy Birthday" had been sung to the woman fondly referred to as the "mother of the nation"."Keep doing as you have been doing, makhosikazi [women]. You have that power to fix this country," she told the members of the league gathered in Soweto on Monday afternoon.Madikizela-Mandela said that, during the struggle, they never heard of leaders fighting each other because everyone was fighting for freedom. She also thanked the league for hosting the event, saying she'd been a member of the&nbsp;ANC since 1956, but had never received anything like it before.Madikizela-Mandela urged women to help rebuild the country. She said they made up the majority of its citizens and could help fix it, adding that there were no no-go areas."You must go to Marikana and assist the widows there. You should also go to KwaZulu-Natal where female councillors were killed and help there," she said.A dinner in Madikizela-Mandela's honour would also be held at Emperors Palace on Monday evening.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
