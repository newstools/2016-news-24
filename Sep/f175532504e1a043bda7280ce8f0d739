Bridget.SiebertPRESIDENT Jacob Zuma has declared 27 December 27 a public holiday after an appeal by the Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa). A recent Presidency statement said the day, a Tuesday, was being declared a public holiday in terms of Section 2A of the Public Holidays Act. The request by Fedusa was motivated by the fact that this year workers in the country will only have 11 public holidays instead of 12 due to the fact that Christmas Day falls on a Sunday, the statement said. According to Section 2(1) of the Public Holidays Act, 1994, whenever a public holiday falls on a Sunday, the following Monday shall be a public holiday. However, this year the Monday following December 25 is another public holiday, the Day of Goodwill. This has resulted in the two public holidays overlapping. The move would ensure that workers were still entitled to their 12 paid public holidays this year. - News24. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
