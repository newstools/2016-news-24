Somalia, which lies north of Kenya, wants it to continue along the line of the land border, in a southeast direction.Valuable deposits&nbsp;Kenya wants it to go in a straight line east, along the parallel of latitude, giving it more sea territory.The disputed triangle of water stretches over more than 100 000km2&nbsp;believed to hold valuable deposits of oil and gas in a part of Africa only recently found to be sitting on significant reserves.The Kenyan side argues it has exercised uncontested jurisdiction over the disputed sea boundary since 1979, when it proclaimed its Exclusive Economic Zone.It insists also that it had previously agreed with Mogadishu to resolve the spat through talks, not through legal action."In 2009 the two parties agreed to delimit the maritime boundary by negotiation, and not by recourse to the Court," Muigai said in a statement.But Somalia has told the court that diplomatic negotiations "have failed to resolve this disagreement."This week's hearings by the ICJ, set up in 1945 to rule on disputes between United Nations members, in fact will deal with Kenya's objections to the court's jurisdiction to rule on the matter.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
