It will therefore subsidise the fee adjustments for poor and working class students and has accepted the 8% capped fee increase proposal from the department.Protests 'out of order'"Cabinet is deeply concerned," he said. "We spent a lot of time discussing this issue.""That is one of the reasons the president is meeting with the cluster; so he can have the full briefing, taking into account that a person has already died at Wits and the destruction of property, etc."There&nbsp;are approximately 677&nbsp;000 pupils who are going to matriculate this year, he said."What future lies ahead of them in 2017 when libraries and infrastructure are being destroyed?"He said while the protests had gone "out of order" they were part of democracy."But we cannot violate the rights of other people," he added.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
