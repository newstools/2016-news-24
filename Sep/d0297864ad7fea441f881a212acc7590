The column was headlined "Call me names, but gay is not okay&rdquo;.In the column - which was accompanied by a cartoon of a man marrying a goat - Qwelane lauded Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s "unflinching and unapologetic stance" over homosexuality.He also said that he would "totally refuse to withdraw or apologise" for his views in which he also condemned gay marriage. Qwelane said in the column that he believed that when it came to homosexuals&rsquo; "lifestyle and sexual preferences...wrong is wrong!"Qwelane, who subsequently served as Ugandan Ambassador, was originally found guilty in April 2011 by the Johannesburg Equality Court of hate speech in connection with the article, but was not present at the default judgment because of his job abroad.&nbsp;The judgment was withdrawn on 1 September 2011.Qwelane's counsel argued at the time that the default judgment was not allowed, and that a direction hearing needed to be convened before such a judgment could be handed down.In August 2013, the court heard that Qwelane would bring a challenge to the constitutionality of certain provisions of equality legislation.At the time, Qwelane wanted to challenge sections 10 and 11 of the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act. Section 10 deals with hate speech and section 11 with harassment.Boerner said at the time that while Qwelane's "particular expression of his views may have been unpopular, controversial and even shocking&hellip; it neither advocated hatred nor constituted incitement to cause harm. His expression is therefore protected by our Constitution".On Sunday, PsySSA said that "it is travesty of justice that this matter has not yet been concluded".It said that if Qwelane was of "such poor health that he is found to be unfit to stand trial" he should then give the relief sought by the SAHRC which was to &nbsp;"publicly apologise unreservedly for the harm his article caused to the LGBT community" as well as pay R100 000 in damages to an LGBT organisation.Meanwhile, Prof Juan Nel, PsySSA's past president said in a statement this week that recent cases of racist hate speech had been rightly dealt with "swiftly" by the courts.Similar energy needed to be put into finalising cases like Qwelane&rsquo;', he suggested."Failure to actively condemn harmful insult sends a strong social message that it is in fact acceptable to dehumanise gays and lesbians and to liken them to animals, as Qwelane did in his article," he said. &nbsp; PsySSA said it was preparing an application for leave to appeal against the postponement - a move that Boerner deemed "illogical".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
