"We are particularly concerned that this decision by the court now opens the way for further criminal proceedings against the defendants who, if found guilty, could be sentenced to life in prison," he said. Bahgat and Eid are among 12 human rights who, since February, have reportedly been subjected to a travel ban linked to ongoing investigations, Colville said."The High Commissioner is alarmed by the continuing closure or intimidation of numerous human rights NGOs, and prosecution of their staff, by the Egyptian authorities," he added. Such acts harmed their legitimate right to freedom of expression and of association, thereby undermining the rights of the population at large. The UN also urged Cairo to make good on a pledge to adopt a new NGO law, calling for it to be legislation which "fully complies with Egypt's international human rights obligations".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
