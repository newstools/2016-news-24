The NDGJM argued that the alleged insincerity of the Buhari led government was the reason why they refused to lay down arms.They maintained that they would continue to attack oil pipelines until the government and oil firms ended their "oppressive tendencies". &nbsp;"Until we see a sincere and genuine step towards a just and equitable mending of the injustices of all the years past done to our people, this war shall persist and we can guarantee that they cannot win this one, even if they get all the world&rsquo;s arsenal assembled behind them," the statement read. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
