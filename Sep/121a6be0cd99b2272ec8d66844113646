We are going to fight legally. A lot will happen at the review," he said.Masindi&rsquo;s cousin, Humbulani Mphephu, said they were happythat &nbsp;justice had prevailed.The Mphephu royal family had argued that women could not rule.The Nhlapho commission of inquiry, which completed its work in 2010, recognised the VhaVenda and six others as legitimate traditional royal houses.It was meant to have investigated the VhaVenda kingship dispute, but was replaced in 2011 by the Commission on Traditional Leadership Disputes and Claims.
