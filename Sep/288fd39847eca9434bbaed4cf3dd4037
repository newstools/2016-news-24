Sabina Biggs, 44, was released on bail in the George Magistrate’s Court last month after appearing for the murder of her 29-year-old son, Maurice. However, police have reason to believe that she lied about stabbing her son in the chest, in the early hours of August 13, following an argument in their New Dawn Park, Pacaltsdorp, home. Southern Cape police spokesperson Captain Malcolm Pojie on Wednesday said the mother had claimed to have stabbed her son after a fight broke out when she accused him of stealing her cigarettes and a memory card. Maurice, rumoured to be a drug addict, was declared dead at the scene. Pojie said another suspect had been identified and was being questioned by police after investigations revealed the accused may have given them a false statement. That man, who had suffered two strokes since the murder, had not yet been arrested, Pojie said. He was understood to live in the same house. Pojie said the murder charge against Biggs had not yet been dropped, and the decision to prosecute was yet to be made by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
