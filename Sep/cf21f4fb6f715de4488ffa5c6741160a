But among SADC leaders, the Botswana leader and the late Zambian leader Levy Mwanawasa have been in the last few years the only loud critics of their Zimbabwean counterpart.&nbsp;Piers Pigou of the International Crisis Group tweeted Friday: "Mugabe should have gone years ago! Khama likely to remain a lone voice on this issue."&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
