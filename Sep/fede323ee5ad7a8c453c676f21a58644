[It] was wrong when they said there was no case of compulsory segregation... another court would come with a different conclusion."University management has applied to both the Supreme Court of Appeal and the Constitutional Court for leave to appeal.Gauntlett said in its ruling the court didn't reference their heads of arguments. "There were persistent complaints from students about campus culture and that they do not feel welcome."However, Johan du Toit SC, representing AfriForum, said justice should be done for students who have already registered in their mother tongue."UFS students are exposed to unity and diversity and Afrikaans students shouldn't struggle."In July, the High Court ruled in favour of AfriForum in their bid to stop a proposed change to the UFS's language policy.Constitutional issuesAt the time Judge Fouche Jordaan said: "The fact that English has been introduced at the UFS, which was a historical Afrikaans university, as a language of instruction does not mean that Afrikaans must inevitably be replaced by English as the dominant language of instruction."In March the university decided to make English the primary medium of instruction from 2017, while providing sufficient scope for multilingualism across the university.Jordaan said the UFS council did not consider constitutional issues involved in the decision on the new language policy.He said while Afrikaans might be a barrier to black students, English was a barrier to many coloured students who had been victims of past discrimination. A move that decreased the Afrikaans offering would negatively affect them.The university's council said English would be the primary medium of instruction at undergraduate and postgraduate level on the three campuses in Bloemfontein and QwaQwa.Multilingualism would be supported by an expanded tutorial system designed for first-year students.In professional programmes the parallel-medium teaching in English, Afrikaans, Sesotho and isiZulu would continue. These included teacher education and the training of theology students who wished to enter the ministry in traditional Afrikaans-speaking churches, where there was a clear market need. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
