[It] was wrong when they said there was no case of compulsory segregation... another court would come with a different conclusion."In July, the High Court ruled in favour of AfriForum in their bid to stop a proposed change to the UFS's language policy.At the time Judge Fouche Jordaan said: "The fact that English has been introduced at the UFS, which was a historical Afrikaans university, as a language of instruction does not mean that Afrikaans must inevitably be replaced by English as the dominant language of instruction."In March, the university decided to make English the primary medium of instruction from 2017, while providing sufficient scope for multilingualism across the university.Jordaan said the UFS council did not consider constitutional issues involved in the decision on the new language policy.He said while Afrikaans might be a barrier to black students, English was a barrier to many coloured students who had been victims of past discrimination. A move that decreased the Afrikaans offering would negatively affect them. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
