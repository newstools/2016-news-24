The women shared their stories of abuse, rape, loss and isolation and found consolation in sharing. A book called A Life was launched by Apostle Claire Webster at the event. “My book tells about my life story. I have been broken, hopeless after an attempted rape when I was young.  “I lost seven siblings and it hurt me. I realised that God was shaping my life. I believe that God uses pain to heal people,” said Webster. Organiser Crystal Ruiters said women should love, care and be strong for each other.          24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
