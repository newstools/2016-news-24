Officials say it is suspicious that the men did not travel through Beitbridge because that border post is much closer to Mozambique (but often, much more time-consuming to negotiate). They appear to have begun their journey in South Africa.Under Zimbabwe's Defence Act, it is a criminal offence to sell, wear or use any uniform looking like a military uniform. Those convicted under this act risk a fine or a year in jail."The men are suspected to be part of a group that takes advantage of civil disturbances to assault civilians while wearing security forces' uniforms," the Chronicle said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
