The prosecutor confirmed that the state did not oppose bail being granted to Dumisani Majola (56), but did not give any reasons in court. Majola&rsquo;s attorney, Thuli Mbatha, told the court her client is a pensioner, is married and has two children. She said he can afford bail of R1 000. Magistrate R. Ngubane thereafter granted Majola bail of that amount, and ordered him not to have contact with the alleged victim, Mpiloh Ngwenya. The case was postponed to October 4 for further investigation. Majola is charged with kidnapping Mpiloh from his home at Prestbury on the afternoon of Friday, September 2, and of driving off with him in his car. Police found the child a few hours later and returned him safely to his parents. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
