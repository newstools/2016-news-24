Zimbabwe lost at least 200 elephants this way in Hwange in 2013 and another 60 or so last year.&nbsp;The most recent cyanide poisoning was reported in May in Gwaai Forest, near Hwange. Since then there have been no recorded cases of this type of poisoning so this report will worry conservationists. Many of the cyanide poisonings in the past have taken place in the last four months of each year, when the land is at its driest."The poisoning wasn&rsquo;t in the [Hwange National] park. It was just outside the park, on the Lukosi River," Trevor Lane of the Bhejane Trust said.Zimbabwe's national parks and wildlife management authority is investigating the tragedy.It will revive memories of two Italians shot dead earlier this year in Mana Pools when they were mistaken for poachers by state rangers. The father and son were helping out with an anti-poaching operation.President Robert Mugabe's government insists that Zimbabwe has too many elephants, putting the total at more than 80 000. But high levels of poaching in some areas are a huge threat, with one report suggesting that the overall elephant population in the country had gone down by 6.8% between 2011 and 2014. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
