"Even when I practised, personally my legs were running but my mind was also racing, preoccupied by the suffering all around me. All this has been on my mind for a very, very long time.&rdquo; "I knew this was being live broadcast around the world, and I wanted to show that the protests in Ethiopia were peaceful, just like my sign was," he says.Lelisa said that more athletes who got the opportunity to compete on the global stage needed to speak out against the persecution of the Oromo people in his country.In what was considered as the country's worst unrest in over a decade, the Oromo tribe started protesting in 2015 November against the government's plan to reallocate farmland.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
