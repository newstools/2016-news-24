The National Prosecuting Authority's Eric Ntabazalila said that Novella's attorney had indicated, outside of today's proceedings, that they would apply for leave to appeal his bail application during a pre-trial conference. "He also indicated that issues related to cellphone information have been resolved," Ntabazalila said.He added that Novella would continue to be held in the hospital wing of Pollsmoor Prison, where his lawyer had convinced the court that his client needed to be held, as he was at risk of being assaulted or killed in "atrocious" prison cells that hold around 40 inmates. The case is due before court again on September 16 for another pre-trial conference. &nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
