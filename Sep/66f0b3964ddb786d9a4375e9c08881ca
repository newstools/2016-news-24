It destroyed our property, it destroys our assets and also disorganised the pupils," said Motshekga.Addressing pupils, Motshekga said they were faced with unsympathetic systems and no preferential treatment would be given."If you don't pass well here, no one will recognise that you are from the burnt school, so it does not matter anymore. You will be treated like other children who never had difficulties," she said.Some pupils had been away from school for nearly three months while the municipal boundary dispute raged.She told pupils that they must do whatever it takes to succeed as the examination they were due to write would not take into account that they lost time during the protests."Do whatever it takes to succeed, you can't eat self-pity," she said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
