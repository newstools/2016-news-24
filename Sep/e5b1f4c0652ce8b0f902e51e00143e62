The issue of water has been there for a long time. Some people have been reported sick because of it," he said.eMalahleni municipal manager Theo Van Vuuren said eMahlaleni&rsquo;s water situation had improved significantly over the past few years."However, with a very old infrastructure base, we are suffering huge losses due to pipe bursts, as well as sporadic problems in areas with water quality and availability."Their main source was the Witbank Dam.
