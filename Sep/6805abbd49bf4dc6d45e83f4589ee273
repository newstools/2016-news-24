It's calamitous and can by no means be digested," Unisa SRC secretary general Buyisile Njokweni told reporters on Wednesday.Njokweni said "the call to down tools is imminent and unavoidable", but that students should make time to catch up on their studies."I mean the education physical tools will be put down during the day and picked up in the evenings so we don't lose track of knowledge and wisdom."Njokweni said, in the meantime, they would wait for an announcement by the university council for a 0% increment. Any increase would see students taking to the streets."In due course, we will make a call on all Unisa students everywhere in the country, in all nine provinces to shut down every Unisa regional centre. Let us not shut down as yet," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
