Karabo Ngoepe, News24Pretoria - The City of Tshwane on Tuesday implemented water restrictions as the country continued to deal with the effects of drought.Infrastructure MMC Darryl Moss told the media that the Department of Water and Sanitation had published a notice stating that drawing water from the Integrated Vaal River System should be limited."The city of Tshwane is therefore obliged to comply with the notice and reduce its water consumption by 25%," Moss said."We receive 72% of our bulk water from Rand Water, but we also source 28% of our water from our own treatment plants and boreholes."Moss further indicated that the limitation for drawing water from the Vaal River System by urban and irrigation users would result in restrictions that include watering/irrigating gardens with a hosepipe or sprinkler from 6:00-18:00."Washing of vehicles with hosepipes and filling of swimming pools. The same restrictions which were implemented last year will apply with immediate effect from today."We urge all our consumers to join us in making efforts to reduce the water consumption," he said.Moss added that failure to adhere to the restrictions would result in the City taking drastic steps to enforce compliance."Should consumers not adhere to the restrictions as imposed by the department, as well as Rand Water, then the situation will get worse and consumers will be without water for longer periods. Furthermore, if the situation does not improve then the City will be forced to introduce increased tariffs, increased policing and water shedding," said Moss.He added that they have the powers to impose fines on those found to be going against the call for using water sparingly, but that would be last resort.&ldquo;if we don&rsquo;t reach our targets then we will impose punitive measures,&rdquo; he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
