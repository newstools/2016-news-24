It is almost at par with last year but take into consideration that the economy is going through a little slowdown," Fowler was quoted as saying.According to BBC, Fowler said there were plans to twin tougher enforcement with a waiver on interest and penalties for the period 2012 - 2015."We will give them a 45-day window to come forward and register and that will make them eligible for that waiver," he was quoted as saying.The government, struggling to fund a record 6.06 trillion naira ($18.6 billion) 2016 budget that aimed to stimulate growth by tripling capital expenditure, set FIRS a target of raising 4.95 trillion naira in taxes, up from 3.73 trillion last year. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
