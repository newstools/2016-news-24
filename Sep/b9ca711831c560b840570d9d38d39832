We are still waiting on him to put current administration policies in place."Mashaba had to prove to Johannesburg residents that he was capable and had alternative policies and programmes. So far he had failed to do so."I need him to put his programmes in place first. I don&rsquo;t expect him to seek my advice. So far he hasn&rsquo;t put up alternatives."Tau said Mashaba needed to be magnanimous and acknowledge the projects his administration had initiated."There is a degree of magnanimity that is required. Some of the statements he has made are unfortunate. My view is: get on with the job." Tau said he would jealously guard some of the programmes he had initiated during his tenure, such as replacing the ageing bus fleet with a more environmentally friendly one.&nbsp; ANC Johannesburg spokesperson Jolidee Matongo said Mashaba had a vendetta against Tau."We think he just has a programme to attack the ANC and Tau. He needs to get on with his job so we can see what he is doing, but instead he is attacking the Tau," Matongo said.&nbsp; Mashaba dismissed Tau's claims. "That is paranoia. If he has not done his job, and I raise this with the media when asked, how is this a vendetta? I have to do what is in the best interests of the people of Johannesburg," Mashaba said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
