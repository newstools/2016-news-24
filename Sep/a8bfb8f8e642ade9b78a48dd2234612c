"The key catalyst of South Sudan's civil war has been competition for the grand prize, control over state assets and the country's abundant natural resources, between rival kleptocratic networks led by president Kiir and (former) vice president Machar," the report said.South Sudan recently agreed to the deployment of a 4 000-strong regional protection force approved by the UN Security Council after first rejecting the peacekeepers as a violation of its sovereignty. The announcement came after the Security Council met with Kiir during a rare visit to that country. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
