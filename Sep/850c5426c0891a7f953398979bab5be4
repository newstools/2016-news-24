He has appeared in court six times, spent a night in prison, received death threats and he&rsquo;s convinced his cellphone is bugged. Booysen, the suspended KwaZulu-Natal head of the Hawks, has written a book that has sent shock waves through the country since it appeared 10 days ago. Booysen is caught in a web of political intrigue and power struggles. His opponents, he says, are not &ldquo;local spaza shop owners&rdquo;. They include a national police commissioner, the head of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), the minister of police and his boss, the current head of the Hawks, Major General Mthandazo Berning Ntlemeza. The authors approached the people implicated in the book, including Lieutenant General Richard Mdluli, the suspended crime intelligence boss who faces charges of assault and kidnapping, but they declined to comment.&ldquo;There are currently three big investigations going on. The involvement of Anwa Dramat [former Hawks boss] and Shadrack Sibiya [former Gauteng Hawks boss] in the alleged deportation of four Zimbabweans in 2010 and 2011; the so-called rogue unit at the SA Revenue Service; and the so-called Cato Manor death squad.&ldquo;These three investigations are related. Factions within crime intelligence are pulling the strings. And behind all of it is the puppet master, Mdluli. &ldquo;People are always asking me what&rsquo;s going on and there&rsquo;s no simple answer. You have many protagonists, each with an own agenda, and with a common enemy.&rdquo; He said there were factions in crime intelligence that were not fighting crime, but committing it. &ldquo;Sometimes I think the crime intelligence unit should be renamed Crime Incorporated. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not random, they don&rsquo;t just decide, let&rsquo;s deal with Johan Booysen; somewhere, somebody is pulling the strings,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;The NPA has been hijacked by people like Nomgcobo Jiba [deputy director of public prosecutions, who was disbarred this week and put on special leave].&rdquo;Booysen said the strategy was to neutralise the people in institutions who were investigating certain important people. The method they used was to investigate the investigators. &ldquo;Crime intelligence leaks certain documents and people are charged or suspended in a matter of days,&rdquo; he said.At his disciplinary hearing in 2014, Booysen said: &ldquo;For 28 years I had a faultless career and won various national and international awards. This was until 2010/11, when I began investigating Thoshan Panday &ndash; a multimillionaire businessman from KwaZulu-Natal, with SA Police Service contracts and Zuma connections. From then on, everything began going off the rails. I was ordered to stop the investigation on various occasions, but Dramat and I decided to go ahead.&rdquo;Booysen was arrested in 2012. Two years later, a judge threw the matter out of court. Riah Phiyega, at the time the new national police commissioner, then charged him internally. He went back to court and applied for an interdict against Phiyega&rsquo;s internal process, which stands to this day. Back at work in 2014, Booysen wasted no time. He immediately resumed his investigation into Panday.&ldquo;[National director of public prosecutions] Shaun Abrahams&rsquo; recent decision to finally prosecute Panday is a cynical, strategic move, because I&rsquo;m forcing his hand with my court application to set aside his decision to prosecute me.&ldquo;In my affidavit, I reveal that there are people who are being protected. Naturally, he wants to say that he is not protecting them because he has decided to prosecute them,&rdquo; Booysen said. Booysen was born to a big, loving family in Vanderbijlpark. They were so poor they shared a toothbrush and lived in his grandmother&rsquo;s garage. When Booysen was in primary school, the family relocated to Amanzimtoti, where he still lives today. All Booysen wants is to be remembered as a good policeman. &ldquo;I was born to be a policeman. That is why I will not back down.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
