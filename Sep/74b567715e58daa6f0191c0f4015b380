He said Pityana&rsquo;s calls for President Jacob Zuma to step down were tantamount to a coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat.Pityana said Manyi didn&rsquo;t understand South Africa&rsquo;s democracy and his comments were ignorant.&ldquo;We uphold free speech, free expression, and as it were we can say the emperor is without clothes. The emperor we have in Zuma is definitely without clothes. He must vacate. One with clothes must come in.&rdquo;The anti-apartheid struggle hero surprised many during the funeral of former sports and recreation minister, Reverend Makhenkesi Stofile, last month when he called for Zuma&rsquo;s resignation. He said Zuma had no credibility and was not fit to continue leading South Africa.He started lobbying different groups, including business and religious organisations, to join the call for Zuma to step down. The time of writing letters to editors had come to an end and more decisive action was needed, he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
