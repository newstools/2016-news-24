It was like a scene from a movie &hellip;&rdquo;Moonsamy said the car then sped off and 10 minutes later, one of the men in the group received a call saying a Hilux had crashed into a few cars at the Highgate Supermarket on Bombay Road.The men drove out to the supermarket where they found the driver and cable-tied his hands together before police arrived.&ldquo;It was such a horrible experience for such a beautiful occasion,&rdquo; said Moonsamy.&ldquo;I think the incident dampened everyone&rsquo;s spirits and some of the cars were badly damaged.&ldquo;We are grateful that no one was injured, however, we hope that this man is put behind bars and receives the full might of the law.&rdquo;Mountain Rise police spokesperson Captain Gay Ebrahim said the man was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and for reckless and negligent driving.She said the man was granted R1 200 bail by police on Sunday and released.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
