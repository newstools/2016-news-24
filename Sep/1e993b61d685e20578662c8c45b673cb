The North Gauteng High Court had already ruled in his favour.Both courts ruled that his suspension was unlawful.McBride said the court giving Parliament 24 months to fix the discrepancies in the Ipid Act confirmed its independence."The principle has been firmly established, Ipid can now do its work without fear, favour or prejudice, it's imperative for us now to act with even greater integrity and ethical behaviour," he said.McBride said he was looking forward to returning to work. His suspension has been preserved for 30 days, in which time Parliament can make a decision on whether to institute disciplinary charges against him or not. He said it was more important for Ipid to fulfil its mandate than ever before.McBride, who said he was happy with the judgment, said there were key lessons in the dispute for the executive."It's an important lesson for the executive, especially the minister, on how not to govern, on how not to interfere with an independent organisation.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
