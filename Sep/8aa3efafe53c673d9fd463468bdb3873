WATCHPietermaritzburg's Darien Bester broke three world records at the Global Powerlifting Committee (GPC) World Championships in Serbia at the weekend.At just 22, Bester broke the world record with a 330 kg deadlift, a 330 kg squat, and a 215 kg bench press for a total of 875 kg lifted altogether.Bester&rsquo;s impressive 215 kg bench press was not enough to break the record, but was added to the score of total weight lifted, which was a world record for the 140 kg-plus junior category.The Pietermaritzburg local said that although he had broken three world records in one day, the realisation had not quite &ldquo;hit him&rdquo;.&ldquo;The rush that I got from lifting in the final attempts was electrifying.&ldquo;My last deadlift was the last lift of the championships, so it was absolutely amazing when I broke the record.&rdquo;Bester said his feelings on his win were &ldquo;hard to put into words&rdquo;, but said he had received incredible support during the competition.&ldquo;Some of the guys were happier than I was when I broke the records,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;As with anything, there are people who are there for themselves, but the majority of people in powerlifting will do as much as they can to help you.&rdquo;Bester said he had been &ldquo;gymming&rdquo; for a few years, but only on a casual basis until 2013.&ldquo;In 2013 I started watching powerlifting videos on YouTube and the openness of the community was incredible, and when the gym I was training at hosted a small in-house competition, I fell in love. &ldquo;In November 2014 I moved to Warren&rsquo;s Gym, which caters better for a powerlifting style of training, and competed in my first official competition in November 2015.&rdquo;From there, Bester started training under Rory Scheepers, whom he termed &ldquo;one of South Africa&rsquo;s top strength coaches&rdquo;.&ldquo;The training was hard leading up to the world championships, but Rory made sure that I would be pushed to my limits in every training session, but never past them.&rdquo;Bester has competed in five powerlifting competitions, with the World Championships being his third official competition.&ldquo;The plan I had from last year&rsquo;s competition in November was to qualify for the nationals, then to qualify for the world championships at the nationals, but I never would have thought I would be breaking three world records.&rdquo;Bester said he would return to Pietermaritzburg this afternoon, and start preparing for an &ldquo;invitational only&rdquo; competition in Pretoria at the end of November.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
