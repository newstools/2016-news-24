Two youth or three found him dead, so they buried him."We don&rsquo;t even know where he was buried. No information up to now," Lucy was quoted as saying.Tens of thousands of people have been killed and more than 2.5 million driven from their homes since a new conflict gripped South Sudan in late 2013 following its split from Sudan under a landmark peace deal.Many journalists paid tribute to Vuni who worked for many years as a journalist and was well respected by his colleagues.Veteran journo Isaac Vuni was a kind, clever, funny man committed to #SouthSudan : confirmed dead after kidnapping https://t.co/WOPqFeZCl1One of few ways to assess #SouthSudan crisis is number sheltering in @unmissmedia bases (Now as high as ever at 201,000, plus 1m refugees) pic.twitter.com/Mon2DY9D6K&mdash; Peter Martell (@petermartell) September 26, 2016One of few ways to assess #SouthSudan crisis is number sheltering in @unmissmedia bases (Now as high as ever at 201,000, plus 1m refugees) pic.twitter.com/Mon2DY9D6K 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
