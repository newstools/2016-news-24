Police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubela said it is believed that the woman was stabbed by her 57-year-old husband who also allegedly stabbed their 21-year-old daughter. "She has been admitted to the Brits Hospital," Makhubela said. According to police, the man then fled with their eight-year-old son, but later handed the child over to a family friend. "The suspect had told the family that he will be handing himself over to police, but he has not done that yet," Makhubela added. A manhunt is currently underway. Police have also urged the public to help should they have any information on the whereabouts of the man.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
