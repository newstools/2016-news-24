Elections by universal direct suffrage are scheduled in 2020.This year will be crucial for Somalia's political transition, said the UN report."Attacks against individual journalists and media organisations have a deeply corrosive impact on democracy, with profoundly negative repercussions on freedom of expression and human rights in general," said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein of Jordan. He called on Somali authorities to investigate violations of freedom of expression "irrespective of the identity of the perpetrators."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
