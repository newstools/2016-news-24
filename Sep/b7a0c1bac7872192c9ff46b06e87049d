Lynn.HitchcockSir, AM totally confused and hope that you, municipal officials or one of your readers, can assist me.Like most Greytonians I was hand-delivered a municipal document a couple of weeks ago titled "Application for refuse collection .But the first page is headed NB: all applications for refuse supply must be accompanied by compulsory documents including certified copy of will and/ trust deed, original ID, and so on.Does this mean that Umvoti Municipality is running short of refuse and is looking for a supply?Then on pages 2 and 3 "Refuse, supply application form , but suddenly it is all about an agreement in respect of the supply of electricity. Here again information required is listed including proof if married by antenuptial contract, what your spouse does, the number of children, vehicle make, etc., etc.Page 4 is an acknowledgment of "indebtedness" refuse. This requires agreement to settle 50% of monies tendered for the purchase of refuse will be used to settle the arrears and 50% of the amount will be provided me refuse." (Can anyone explain exactly what this means.)Confusion continues to flourish - point 4 of this acknowledgment threatens that if there is an outstanding amount "I will not be able to purchase any electricity", but point 5 informs me that if the current account is not paid monthly "I will not be able to purchase refuse."Please could the new council institute a monitoring system to ensure that documents that are sent out in the name of the municipality make sense.And can the council explain to the recipients of this document why Umvoti Municipality now needs a supply of refuse.Thank you.Totally confused citizen24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
