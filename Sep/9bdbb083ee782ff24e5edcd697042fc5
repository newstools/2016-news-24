	     Alert local police have managed to foil an alleged attempted robbery, after they pounced on two men- one armed with a gun- loitering at the gates of a community hall in Old Crossroads, where grants were being paid.  The police said they were acting on a tip- off from the community on Thursday morning, when they made the arrests, said Nyanga police spokesperson Captain Ntomboxolo Sitshitshi.  “Members attached to the Nyanga Crime Prevention apprehended a 20 year old man in possession of an unlicensed firearm in Crossroads.  The members received information about two suspicious looking men, who were standing at a gate of the community hall where community members were queuing to receive their pension payouts,” said Sitshitshi.  She said that the suspects fled at the sight of the police. The men in blue then gave chase.  “One suspect was arrested and was found to be in possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition.  Preliminary investigations revealed that the owner of the firearm (a norrinco pistol) had opened a case of burglary on Tuesday in which this firearm was stolen allegedly by his son, Crossroads,” said Sitshitshi.  However, during the escape, the suspect son managed a clean pair of heels. The suspect appeared at the Athlone Magistrate Court on Monday.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
