They should have stood "firm and vigorous" and persisted with their prosecution of Mdluli on fraud and corruption charges. Judge Francis Legodi ordered their names struck off the roll of advocates.&nbsp; The General Council of the Bar brought a case against them because of their handling of cases including Mdluli&rsquo;s, the prosecution of President Jacob Zuma on corruption charges, and of suspended KwaZulu-Natal Hawks head Johan Booysen.DA Shadow minister for Justice Advocate Glynnis Breytenbach said in a statement on Friday that they welcomed the news that the duo had been placed on special leave."This is a victory for the (NPA) and our nation&rsquo;s prosecutorial integrity. This is also a victory for the General Council of the Bar (GCB) in their bid to ascertain legal certainty that representatives of the NPA ought to be 'fit and proper'. "This suspension will ensure that they do not further facilitate the decline of the NPA and we hope that this signals the first step on their road to departure from the NPA," she said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
