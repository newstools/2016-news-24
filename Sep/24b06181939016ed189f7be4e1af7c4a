Johannesburg â€“ A car thief who stole a vehicle while it was idling at a petrol station was arrested a short while later after crashing it, authorities said on Wednesday. According to Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Wilfred Kgasago, a couple were at a petrol station in Brakpan on Tuesday when their car was stolen. "A couple drove into a petrol station to fill up their Mazda 3. While the driver was in conversation with the petrol attendant and his wife seated in the passenger seat, an unknown man jumped into the vehicle and sped off." Kgasago said the wife jumped out of the moving vehicle resulting in her sustaining an injury to her left arm. She was rushed to Life Springs Parkland Hospital in Springs, he said. The brazen car thief crashed the vehicle in a head-on collision a short while later, Kgasago said. "Unfortunately, due to the thief's reckless driving, the stolen Mazda crashed head-on into a red VW Polo along Vlaakfontein road. The EMPD Brakpan precinct commander came across the accident scene and called for backup." Kgasago said the car thief and the driver of the Polo sustained injuries and had to be transported to Pholosong Hospital. "The 32-year-old suspect is under police guard at Pholosong hospital." Kgasago said both the Mazda and the Polo sustained so much damage he considered them write-offs.
