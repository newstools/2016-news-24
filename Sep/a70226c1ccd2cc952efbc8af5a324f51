	     LIPCO has launched an online petition to call for adequate support for paternity leave in South Africa. We sit down with a legal expert to find out why this is necessary. Watch.WATCH Cape Town - Fathers of both biological and adopted children should be granted 10 business days leave, Parliament's labour portfolio committee heard on Thursday. Henri Terblanche, a Cape Town father, argued for an amendment to the amount of paternity leave stipulated in the Basic Conditions of Employment Act. It should be increased from three to 10 business days, he said. Terblanche, one of the main leaders of the cause, previously made a presentation to the committee in November 2014. He cited research in Norway and Sweden, two countries with progressive paternity leave structures, and highlighted there benefits to society. Fathers were more likely to do household chores regularly, relationships were more sustainable, and there was less likelihood of violence and conflict in marriages as a result of increased paternity leave, the studies showed. Other presenters on Thursday included trade union federation Cosatu, NGO Sonke Gender Justice (SGJ), and members of the public. Mothers from poor communities, supported by SGJ, testified about the positive effects of having a child's father at home for an extended period. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
