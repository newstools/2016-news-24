He told News24 that Zuma had always maintained that he had done nothing wrong."Bottom line is he's paid, admitting to have done something wrong. Now the ball is in the ANC's court. Can South Africa afford to have a president who has violated the Constitution?" he asked.Holomisa said the ANC had once again been presented with the perfect opportunity to get rid of Zuma."He has given you ammunition to get rid of him. ANC, now show him the gate and he must not resist. Zuma must just go."The EFF, in welcoming the news, noted that it was through its efforts that Zuma was made to pay back the money."The EFF welcomes the indisputable fact that the money was paid because of the EFF's insistence and persistence that the remedial actions of the Public Protector must be complied with," said the party in a statement.Continuing to sing its own praises, the EFF said South Africans needed to celebrate its work in fighting against corruption and undue benefits to politicians, adding that the national budget now had additional funds because of the president's payment."The anti-corruption work of the EFF should be celebrated because it took our organisation two years to stop the Nkandla corruption, whilst others had failed for many years."The EFF has also indicated that it would seek further clarity on the main source and principle that led to VBS Mutual Bank granting a loan to the president. The party claims the bank is supposed to benefit ordinary people in Vhembe.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
