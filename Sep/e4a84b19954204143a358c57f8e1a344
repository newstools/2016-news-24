There are no signs that he will resume eating," Bourgon said, adding his client had told him earlier on Wednesday "he did not feel well enough to attend"."And if they come and get me, I will refuse to go," Ntaganda said, according to his lawyer.Ntaganda, who has been held in the ICC's detention unit in the seaside suburb of Scheveningen since he surrendered in 2013, has also instructed his lawyers to stop acting for him.There is little precedent in international law courts for this kind of situation.Judge Robert Fremr warned the court's patience was "very close to the end", adding he believed Ntaganda had voluntarily waived his right to attend the trial.Wife and children&nbsp;Ntaganda, once dubbed The Terminator, has denied 18 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity arising out of savage ethnic attacks carried out in the Democratic Republic of Congo by his rebel Patriotic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (FPLC) in 2002-2003.In a rambling statement read to the court by Bourgon on Tuesday, Ntaganda took issue with the court's refusal last week to ease restrictions on visitors, saying he was losing hope of seeing his wife and children.But Fremr insisted his family was not banned from seeing him, and that the restrictions were aimed at protecting witnesses.A psychiatrist who examined Ntaganda on Wednesday concluded "he is mentally competent to oversee the implications of his decisions," Bourgon said.But despite speaking again to Ntaganda on Wednesday during a 10-minute break in the trial, Bourgon failed to persuade him to return to court.His client was "emotionally really confused", Bourgon said, adding he was trying to resolve the situation.The judges on Tuesday ordered the case should continue in Ntaganda's absence, but in the presence of the defence team.But Bourgon questioned what would happen next."Should we force Mr Ntaganda out of his chair and sit him in the video room?" he asked."What happens after this witness? And what happens next week when Mr Ntaganda falls unconscious? What will happen then? We will continue with the trial with Mr Ntaganda unconscious on his bed?" 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
