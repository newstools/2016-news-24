Failing this, he would cut their services.Makhura said government made a commitment in 2014 to ensure billing problems were solved and unpaid municipal rates were paid.He said as at June 2016, the Gauteng government owed the city R242 503 000 for rates and services. This was 1.5% of the R16.1bn in rates and services businesses, residents, and others owed the city.The government intended paying &ldquo;undisputed invoices,&rdquo; he said.Makhura said the Gauteng government paid R384m to various municipalities in the province between April and July.In its 2016/2017 main appropriation budget, the province allocated an additional R1.2bn to address the property rates accruals. This boosted the budget allocation to more than R800m by the financial year 2018/19, he said.Mashaba said the Gauteng government needs to tell the people of Johannesburg why it could not pay its accounts."Let them tell the people of Johannesburg why government does not have the money to pay its own obligations."Mashaba said in a statement that departments guilty of failing to pay the city were infrastructure development, human settlements, and health. &nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
