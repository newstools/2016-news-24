We don't want him. We want to be addressed by national leadership, not provincial leadership.'Fishing for membership'"Msiza is a factionalist and an opportunist of note."He was here to fish for membership, not address issues that affected the party during the local government elections; and also issues of deployment that include one of the councillors who was not on the candidate list during the list regional conferences," a source told African Eye News Service (AENS) during a telephonic conversation.It is believed that Daniel Msiza is eyeing the provincial chairperson position. He claims to be a supporter of Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa as a future ANC President. Ramaphosa&rsquo;s bid will likely be decided during the ANC national conference in 2017.Meanwhile in Mopani, branches demanded that those councillors who were not on the list during regional list conferences, but who were deployed to various municipalities, be removed. Some of the branches also demanded that regional secretary Baskop Makamu be removed.'Guilty councillors must resign'Makamu said: "We have resolved the issue and stood in one voice that we are all to blame for elections results at regional, provincial and national levels."A resolution would be passed about those councillors who were not at the regional conference, that a special investigation will be done, and if anyone is found guilty, they must resign as councillors."He also said that certain individuals wanted him to resign, but that many branches supported him and were happy with his work ethic.ANC provincial secretary Knox Seabi said: "We will send a team of researchers to all five districts in Limpopo and those who are found to be on the wrong side of the law will face the music."The ANC has recently lost two municipalities: Thabazimbi to an independent candidate and Modimolle to the Democratic Alliance.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
