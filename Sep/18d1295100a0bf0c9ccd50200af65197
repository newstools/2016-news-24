And Nairobi has already sold off concessions on three oil blocks in the disputed area to Italian energy company EniSpA."We could not even agree on a method of delimitation, let alone a boundary," said Sharmani.Somalia filed its suit in 2014 with the ICJ in The Hague, set up to rule in disputes between member states, and the tribunal is now considering whether it has the jurisdiction to hear the case.Lawyers for Mogadishu also slammed Kenya's attitude as "puzzling", saying it was a "developing country, legitimately in a hurry to develop ... and just as impoverished as its neighbour" Somalia."And yet Kenya seems to be trying its best to slow things down and prevent the dispute between the two countries ... from being settled rapidly," lawyer Alain Pellet told the court.At the start of preliminary hearings on Monday, Kenya argued the tribunal was not competent to rule in the case.Basing its argument on a 2009 bilateral accord, it asked the panel to dismiss Somalia's request.The hearings will continue on Wednesday and Friday, and the ICJ will rule later whether to take up the case.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
