cell" composed of three men who had received instructions from the Islamic
State group to carry out attacks in the country, the interior ministry said. The suspects were detained in the northeastern town of
Nador and had been ordered to set up an ISIS branch aimed at "preparing a
series of suicide attacks... against vital targets”, a statement said. The members of the cell are being investigated and will
be referred to trial, it added. In March, the interior ministry said that the alleged
members of a jihadist cell it had arrested the previous month, including a
French national, were plotting to carry out "biological" attacks in
the kingdom. Rabat says 152 "terrorist cells" have been
busted since 2002, including 31 over the past three years with ties to
jihadists in Iraq and Syria. A study by the US-based Soufan Group said in December
that at least 1 200 Moroccans had travelled to fight alongside IS in Iraq and
Syria in the previous 18 months.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
