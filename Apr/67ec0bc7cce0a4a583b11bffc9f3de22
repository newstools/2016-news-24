On Tuesday, police asked for help in their search for the 48-year-old man, National Sea Rescue Institute spokesperson Craig Lambinon said in a statement. "It appears that three local men were returning from an unused fish factory next to St Helena Bay harbour on Sunday night on a kreef bakkie – or small open motor boat - when they began to be swept out to sea by strong winds," Lambinon said. Two of the men, one in his 20s and one in his 30s, abandoned the boat and swam to shore safely, leaving the third man on the boat. The vessel washed ashore on Tuesday morning without the fisherman. An extensive sea and shoreline search failed to find the man. A police dive unit was continuing its search and local police were investigating the incident. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
