"Others, who initially gave us accounts of what they saw during the post-election period, subsequently recanted their evidence and declined to cop-operate with the court," Bensouda said.Ruto, 49, and Sang, 40, had both denied three counts of crimes against humanity - namely murder, forcible deportation and persecution committed during the violence in 2007 and early 2008, in which prosecutors say about 1 300 people were killed.The bloodshed in the east African nation was the worst since independence from Britain in 1963 and shook its image as a regional beacon of stability.Even before the ICC authorised a probe in 2010 to investigate the violence there was a concerted campaign to intimidate witnesses which "intensified in the weeks leading up to the trial and continued throughout the life of the case", Bensouda said.She also accused Nairobi of not fully co-operating with the investigation, a charge which Kenya denies."Despite repeated assurances of co-operation with the court the government of Kenya provided only selective assistance to the prosecution," Bensouda said.She again called on Nairobi to hand over three suspects accused of seeking to bribe witnesses in the case.Ultimately, it was the victims of the violence that would suffer the most, she said."The hurdles we encountered in our efforts to investigate and prosecute have frustrated the course of justice for the victims in this case and this must be a matter of profound regret," Bensouda said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
