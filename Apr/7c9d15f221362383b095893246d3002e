has hailed the unveiling of a six-metre statue of struggle icon and former president
Nelson Mandela in the city of Ramallah, Palestine. The statue, a donation from the City of Johannesburg to
Ramallah, represents a symbol of solidarity with the people of Palestine. Sanco spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu said on Wednesday that
the statue would remind the people of Palestine that they shared similar
struggles with the people of South Africa. "While it will inspire the Palestinians in their
pursuit of freedom and justice, it will also remind us of our obligation
towards supporting efforts to end the conflict in the Middle East and
contributing towards development." Mahlangu commended Johannesburg Mayor Parks Tau for
taking steps to "strengthen relations between Johannesburg and Ramallah
and advancing Madiba's legacy". "Madiba remains a symbol of international solidarity
against racism, injustice and repression. He taught us that peace and
prosperity, tranquillity and security are only possible if these are enjoyed by
all without discrimination.” The unveiling comes after a mission led by the South
African Local Government Association (Salga) to Ramallah in November 2014. The purpose of that visit was to attend the International
Conference of Local Authorities in Solidarity with the Palestinian People. The visit culminated in the signing of a Memorandum of
Understanding between Johannesburg and Ramallah in Salga's bid to promote
international city-to-city relations and collaborations. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
