He says Fransman's case of alleged sexual misconduct puts the party in a 'quagmire' in the year of municipal elections.WATCHCape Town &ndash; Newly reinstated party secretary Faiez Jacobs should not have been allowed back until the completion of the criminal case against him, ANC Western Cape leader Marius Fransman has said.Fransman has bemoaned the state of the party in the province after the national disciplinary committee (NDC) found Jacobs guilty of assaulting a staff member, and suspended him for 18 months.His sanction was suspended for three years, meaning he could get back to work immediately.Fransman said what was happened in the ANC Western Cape was a "laughable, political joke"."What message is this sending to the public? That it's fine if you belong to a certain faction, therefore you can be absolved."He said Jacobs was not supposed to be back at work. He said the party needed to be consistent."It seems as if they say its fine for the secretary of the ANC to beat up people, to assault staff members."This tells the public that is what happening to me is a complete mockery of justice."Fransman said the inconsistency would not pass unnoticed by ANC members on the ground. "This will affect the party in a negative way."He said at this point, the party had "little capacity to lead us into an election. The only thing that can prevail is unity".He also lamented the return of Boland regional secretary Jonton Snyman after the NDC set aside his expulsion last month.Snyman was convicted of fraud in 2014, and was expelled from the party in October 2015.He was reinstated after the party found that the complaint had been brought nine months after the fraud conviction.Fransman said this was a joke."They are telling the public that it's fine if you are a fraudster."He said this was sending out the wrong message.Fransman is still awaiting the outcome of the sexual harassment complaint against him, a case which is being heard by the party's integrity committee."My biggest concern is that people shouldn't use the integrity committee for factional battles. And I have faith that the integrity of the integrity committee will be protected."ANC provincial spokesperson Jabu Mfusi said they would not be drawn on Fransman's personal views."The ANC Western Cape respects the decision of the ANC national disciplinary committee. We shall discuss our general overview internally at our PEC meeting and if needs be, we shall communicate."Fransman was asked to step aside pending the outcome of the investigation. He has been accused of sexually harassing a woman while travelling to the North West for the ANC's celebrations in Rustenburg in January.He has vehemently denied the allegations.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
