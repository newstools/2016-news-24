Wim Pretorius, News24Orange Farm &ndash; After a tense morning on the Golden Highway outside Orange Farm, where protesters had set tyres alight and blocked roads during a service delivery protest, the situation&nbsp;was back under control,&nbsp;metro police said on Monday. According to Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar of the Johannesburg Metro Police Department, traffic&nbsp;was flowing again, although protesters were still in the area&nbsp;and some tyres were&nbsp;still burning. Traffic had to be diverted earlier on Monday due to the protests. Motorists had been advised to use the N1, N12 or R59 instead. Minnaar told News24 that protesters&nbsp;had taken&nbsp;to the N1 near Grasmere Toll Plaza and that some vehicles had been stoned. No injuries had been reported so far. "We can confirm that some vehicles have been pelted with stones, but there is no confirmation yet at to the amount of damage caused." Police remained at the scene to ensure the situation remained under control. On April 13, the ANC reported that a group of Orange Farm boys had thrown stones at Johannesburg Mayor Parks Tau after he met residents for talks over 600 unfinished RDP houses, a sewerage system which had not been installed properly, and the city's plans to begin road construction in the area. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
