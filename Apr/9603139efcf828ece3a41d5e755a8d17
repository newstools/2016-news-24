Madonsela had also recommended that Zuma reprimand the ministers involved.However, provincial secretary Themba Mthembu said the provincial SACP had been &ldquo;disturbed&rdquo; by the reprimand of Nxesi. &ldquo;The SACP in the Moses Mabhida Province believes that the reprimand is unwarranted mainly because when the monumental acts of corruption and theft of state resources at a massive scale were committed Comrade Thulas Nxesi was not the minister of Public Works.&ldquo;The party believes the reprimand is very unfair to Comrade Thulas, more especially because when he took over he is the one who instituted investigations that resulted in the action taken against certain officials.&ldquo;Worse still, the recent Constitutional Court judgment did not pronounce on Nxesi&rsquo;s involvement in the Nkandla debacle,&rdquo; he said24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
