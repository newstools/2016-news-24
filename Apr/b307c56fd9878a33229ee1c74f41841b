This statement failed "to understand the structural gender inequality and poverty that women in particular face across our country", she said.She slammed Malema&rsquo;s recent comments during a media interview that "he was prepared to remove the government via the barrel of the gun"."The reality is that the EFF is too extreme and radical to govern."Malema was expected to launch his party's election manifesto at Orlando Stadium in Soweto later on Saturday.Are you registered to vote?
