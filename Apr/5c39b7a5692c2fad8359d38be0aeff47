Don't treat them all in the same way," the senator added.Rights groups have accused Egypt's security services of carrying out illegal detentions, forced disappearances of activists and torture of detainees since the ouster of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in July 2013.After his removal, a police crackdown targeting Morsi's supporters has left hundreds dead and tens of thousands jailed. Hundreds more have been sentenced to death including Morsi himself.In March, US Secretary of State John Kerry said there was a "deterioration in the human rights situation in Egypt in recent weeks and months".Ties between Washington and Cairo deteriorated after Morsi's ouster.The US froze its annual $1.3 bn of military aid to Egypt, which led Cairo to warm up to Russia and France to meet its arms requirements.But the aid was later released even as Washington remains critical of the government's rights record.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
