The lion is seen walking towards a river inside the park in a bid to cross over to the other side, when it suddenly stops at the banks as if assessing the speed of the water. Finally, it gets into the water and slowly, it tries to cross the river, but somewhere in the middle, the cat is overwhelmed and is swept into a mini-waterfall in the thicket. Watch the video below. This incident comes just a few days after the killing of 13-year-old lion nicknamed "Mohawk". Mohawk was reported to have been shot by a Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) ranger after hurting a passer-by near Isinya, which borders the Park. The killing of Mohawk caused an outrage among Kenyans after its slaughter went viral on social media, with conservationists calling for action to be taken against those who authorised the action instead of sedating the animal and taking it back to its habitat.The Head of Veterinary Services at KWS, Dr Francis Gakuya, said his team could not reach the lion in time to tranquilise it because they got stuck in the mud 3km away for 45 minutes.He added that once a male lion reaches a certain age, they crave to mark their territory and start a family. Gakuya appealed to Kenyans to report any stray lion to KWS, adding that lions were usually calm animals and when not agitated, did not harm humans and would eventually find their way back.
