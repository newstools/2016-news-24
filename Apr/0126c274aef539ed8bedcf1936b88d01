CORRECTION OF REPORTS ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT JUDGEMENTThe Presidency wishes to correct media reports wrongly stating that the judgement by the Constitutional Court found that President Jacob Zuma had broken his oath of office. The Constitutional Court did not make such a declaratory order.In fact, whereas the counsel for the EFF, the Applicant, specifically asked for the Constitutional Court to declare that the President had acted in violation of his oath of office, the Constitutional Court did not grant a declaratory order in those terms.The Constitutional Court instead ruled that &ldquo;The failure by the President to comply with the remedial action taken against him, by the Public Protector in her report of 19 March 2014, is inconsistent with section 83(b) of the Constitution read with sections 181(3) and 182(1)(c) of the Constitution and is invalid.&rdquo;We wish to request the media to report accurately and use the precise words of the Constitutional Court judgement on the matter in order not to mislead the public.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
