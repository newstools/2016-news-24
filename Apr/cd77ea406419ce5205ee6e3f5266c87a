"I am also aware that most female students have resorted to prostitution and other immoral means to survive," he added. This appeared to be a reference to reports that some students engage in transactional sex with often older, wealthier partners in order to make ends meet.Fees for institutions of higher education in Zimbabwe are generally lower than in neighbouring South Africa. The state-run National University of Science and Technology charges around $800 per semester for some courses. Private universities such as Solusi and Africa University charge around $1 300 to $1,500 per semester, depending on the course.Pfunye said President Robert Mugabe's "clear lack of will to pay attention to education and students, or rather incapacity to do so has led to the deterioration of our academic standards as a nation".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
