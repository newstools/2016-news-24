A first instalment of $117.9 million was made in December to help the country cope with lower commodity prices that have depressed revenues.Mozambican Prime Minister Carlos Agostinho Rosario on Tuesday began an emergency visit to Washington to meet with IMF and World Bank officials. Aid has been suspended "pending a full disclosure and assessment of the facts," on the unreported borrowing, Sayeh said."It is difficult to imagine how the government will provide a satisfactory explanation for its handling of the debt," wrote Anne Frhauf of the New York-based Teneo Intelligence in a note to investors."All this will have a massive impact on virtually every financial lifeline available to Maputo, at a time when the country thought it was just getting past its balance of payments tight spot."Mozambique is one of the poorest countries in the world, and a quarter of its budget comes from donors.The discovery of oil in 2010 sparked a period of optimistic growth and investment, but the fall in world prices of raw materials saw the local currency, the metical, drop by more than 40% against the US dollar last year.In December 2014, the IMF froze financial aid to another African country, Mali, for six months after discovering "lapses" in public financial management and the purchase of a new $40 million presidential aircraft.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
