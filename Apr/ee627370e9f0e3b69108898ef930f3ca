The Nigerian army has said the high death toll numbers were "unsubstantiated". One medic at ABUTH told AFP in January he counted at least 400 bodies in the morgue on the evening of December 12 while locals said as many bodies also littered on the streets.The IMN has said some 730 members were unaccounted for, "either killed by the army or... in detention". In February, prosecutors said 191 IMN supporters in custody were charged with firearms and public order offences.Zakzaky and the IMN have previously clashed with Nigeria's secular authorities over their quest to establish an Islamic state through an Iranian-style revolution. The cleric has periodically been incarcerated for alleged incitement and subversion.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
