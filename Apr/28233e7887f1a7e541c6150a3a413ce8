I can't go and summon people [to investigate], that is the role of the police," he said on the sidelines of an anti-crime walkabout in Philippi on Thursday.He would not&nbsp;to whom he had given&nbsp;the affidavits, but denied leaking them to the media.Plato's denial came after various affidavits surfaced in news reports claiming links between Vearey and Czech fugitive Radovan Krejcir, and a murder.One affidavit claimed Vearey received R6m from Krejcir, while in another he was accused of working with a suspected gang boss who ordered a hit in Strand in January.Affidavit scrutinisedAn affidavit central to the spat between the politician and the police head has been under scrutiny.&nbsp;The affidavit allegedly linked Vearey to the murder in Strand.Plato denied an accusation that he had fabricated information.He was not present when the affidavits were drawn up and, even if his office was used to do so, it did not matter, Plato said. It was the content that was essential.The affidavit was allegedly signed by an advocate from the office of the provincial police ombudsuman, Vusi Pikoli, and bore an unauthorised stamp.Pikoli has distanced himself from the public spat and said the issue needed to be resolved urgently for the sake of peace in the province.&nbsp;ANC threatens court actionA high level meeting was held on Tuesday with Police Minister Nathi Nhleko and acting national commissioner, Khomotso Phahlane, resulting in an agreement that&nbsp;Plato and Vearey would not discuss the matter in public anymore.They were told that the claims would be investigated. Earlier this week, Nhleko said divisional commissioner for detectives, Lieutenant General Kotsi Nkomo, would investigate the allegations.On Thursday, the ANC in the province threatened to take Plato to court. Provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs said the party was consulting&nbsp;its lawyers."The ANC will use all the means at its disposal, including a class action suit, to protect the victims of gangsterism and drugs from corrupt politicians who seek to ensure that our people continue to live in complete squalor as was the case under the illegitimate apartheid regime."On Thursday, Vearey referred all questions to the national commissioner&rsquo;s office. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
