Cape Town - Gauteng parents trying to register their children for Grade 1 and 8 have expressed their anger and frustration after the department of education's new online registration system failed to launch. MEC for Education in Gauteng, Panyaza Lesufi, assured that the website would be ready to go by 08:00 on Tuesday morning despite multiple issues leading up to the launch. The launch was then moved up to 10:00, but had yet to go live hours following the new deadline. Furious parents have taken to social media expressing their frustrations at the system: With respect Mr @Lesufi How can we trust a system that keeps crashing?It also provides school names in the list that closed years ago.  Lesufi assured parents on Twitter that everything was fine, he is just "a perfectionist". The Gauteng Education Department released the following statement following the crash: "Morning. Kindly note that due to a technical glitch in the Learner Admissions website, the website will go live at 10h00 and not at 8h00 as previously communicated. We sincerely apologise for the delay. As a result of this delay, today’s media briefing will be postponed to 12h00."
