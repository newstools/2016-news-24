It had earlier advised commuters to seek alternative transport. "The Pretoria/Joburg line has been opened and trains are now safely running behind schedule. Thanking commuters for their understanding," Metrorail later tweeted. Meanwhile, Metrorail said Platforms 11 and 12 at Cape Town Station are still out of service following the fire. They received the most significant damage and will remain closed until a report is received from structural engineers. - PICS: Fire at Cape Town Station However, Platforms 8-10 were reopened on Monday after technicians worked around the clock to restore full functionality, Metrorail said.
