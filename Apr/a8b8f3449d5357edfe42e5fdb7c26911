She was&nbsp;attacked for hours for comments she had made in the public sphere about the powers of her office.Horn said on Thursday that,&nbsp;given that the Constitutional Court had made her powers clear, the committee should apologise to the Public Protector."We need to apologise and try and normalise relationships with this very important Chapter 9 institution," he said.ACDP MP Steve Swart concurred. "We need to apologise to the Public Protector for the manner in which she was treated."Swart threw the chairperson&rsquo;s 2015 words back at him, where he had rubbished Madonsela&rsquo;s report on President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s Nkandla homestead.Committee chairperson Mathole Motshekga said the committee had not been in front of the court, only Parliament and the president.ANC MP Bongani Bongo said he did not think they had to apologise for anything at all."It&rsquo;s like when the judgment of the lower court is dismissed by the higher court. We must concentrate on issues in front of us," he said.ANC MP Chana Pilane-Majake agreed. "Maybe the DA wants to apologise for something and they should."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
