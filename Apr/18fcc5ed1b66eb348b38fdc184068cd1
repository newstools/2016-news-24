Karabo Ngoepe, News24Pretoria &ndash; Three men accused of killing businessman Wandile Bozwana had their case postponed yet again when they appeared in the Pretoria Magistrate&rsquo;s Court on Wednesday.Prosecutor Matric Luphondo asked the court to postpone it to June 22 to allow the Director of Public Prosecutions to make a decision on how to proceed with the matter.The court has ordered that the three may not be named. They face charges of murder and attempted murder. Defence lawyer Victor Nkwashu did not oppose the postponement and indicated he had been given a copy of the provisional charge sheet.&nbsp; "I was made to understand that there might be further investigations and they would inform us,&rdquo; he said. Bozwana died in hospital after being ambushed, in what is believed to be a hit, while he was a passenger in a yellow Renault Clio in October.Police said the Clio, driven by Bozwana&rsquo;s female companion Mpho Baloyi, was stationary at a traffic light on the N1 Garsfontein off-ramp when a BMW M3 pulled up next to them.A man jumped out and opened fire. The 43-year-old Bozwana was hit by at least nine bullets. Baloyi, who was hit twice, survived. Two men were arrested last year in connection with the murder. They were found in possession of semi-automatic and automatic rifles and ammunition. The third man was arrested in January. Police said he was the alleged mastermind behind the crime. He&nbsp;was arrested when he handed himself over in connection with crimes not related to the murder. His involvement in the case was established during investigations. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
