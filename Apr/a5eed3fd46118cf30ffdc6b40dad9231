"We have since agreed to another new approach that is called a decline &ndash; &nbsp;where you remove soil until you get to the container," he explained at a media conference ahead of his budget vote speech on Tuesday. "We have been informed that that will not take less than six months," he said. Pretty Nkambule, Solomon Nyarenda and Yvonne Mnisi were trapped in a lamp room container on the surface when a part of ground at the mine near Barberton collapsed on February 5. Rescuers tried to get to them but had to withdraw several times as more ground collapsed. Seventy miners were rescued via a ventilation shaft but the rock that fell over the container has made it difficult to reach the three. ANC MP, Mandla Mandela, took a moment during Zwane's speech later at Parliament to turn attention to at least five illegal miners who were trapped underground during a rockfall in a disused mine in Pongola on Friday. Mandela said from Saturday there seemed to be no hope for them, and he offered condolences to their families.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
