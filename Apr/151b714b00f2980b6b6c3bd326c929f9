In a brief trial, Lesiba Kekana pleaded guilty on five counts: four for murder and one for assault.Kekana, 37, was arrested last year in September after he brutally killed his four sons shortly after he had an argument with his wife Lorraine Kekana. His legal representative read a statement detailing his confession and admission of guilt to the murder. "The court is satisfied that the contents of the statement comply with the charges preferred against the accused and the accused is found guilty as charged," said Judge Joseph Raulinga. He killed his four sons - Bokang Kekana, 13, Keneilwe Kekana, 10, Hlologelo Kekana, 6, and Lekgoledi Kekana, 4 - by slitting their throats. “We had an argument over the phone and I got extremely angry that I resolved myself that I should kill myself, immediately after hanging up the phone, Bokang Kekana came to where I was, I then thought what will happen to them as am the one [sic]," the statement read. Kekana also claimed that he attempted to commit suicide, but failed as police and members of community at Moletlane village forced themselves into his house. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
