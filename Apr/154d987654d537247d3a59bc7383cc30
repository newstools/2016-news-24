Jeanette Chabalala, News24 Durban – Just days after Police Minister Nathi Mthethwa visited KwaMashu in the wake of a killing spree, a 27-year-old is in a critical condition in hospital after another shooting incident at a hostel on Saturday morning, KwaZulu-Natal paramedics said.   The critically wounded man was stabilised on the scene before being transported to a nearby hospital for further medical care, Netcare 911 spokesperson Athlenda Mathe said.    However, police spokesperson Major Thulani Zwane said he was not aware of the latest shooting.   On Sunday, four people were killed in execution-style murders at the hostel.   The four were gunned down inside Block 192, Xolani Road, inside the men's hostel complex. It is understood that a group of approximately six people entered the block, forced the victims to lie on the ground, and then executed them. This prompted a visit on Thursday by Hawks head Major General Berning Ntlemeza, Nhleko, Correctional Services Minister Michael Masutha and National Prosecuting Authority boss Shaun Abrahams. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
