Spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu said the call was outrageous and irresponsible."Such illogical gibberish will push poor people into deeper poverty if it is taken seriously by the ignorant in our society," Mahlangu said.According to a TimesLive report, Malema said: "Give birth and expand because if we do not make children we are going to disappear as a black nation. To make children is a revolutionary duty&sbquo; because children represents reproduction of society. And when you reproduce yourself you reproduce your ideas and legacy." &nbsp;Malema was addressing a crowd in Soweto earlier in the week.&nbsp;Mahlangu said that the hollow rhetoric would perpetuate a cycle of poverty.He, instead, called on women to continue taking contraceptives and emphasised the importance of family planning.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
