Residents from Usasaza, Dunoon, Killarney and Phoenix were among those affected by the closures. &nbsp; Herron said key incidents included two attacks on the Dunoon station &ndash; one last Sunday and the other on March 20 whereby bricks and stone were thrown through the glass and a petrol bomb and burning mattress then thrown in the station. Bricks and stonesLast week, as well as at various times last month, the Usasaza station was attacked by protestors who threw bricks and stones, damaged the building and burnt tyres on the road designated for the MyCiTi buses. &nbsp; Last month, a MyCiTi bus was stoned along Montague Drive and protesters on several occasions prevented our buses from leaving the depots in the morning. &nbsp; Herron said problem was exacerbated for commuters who had brought long-term tickets and did not have additional money to pay for other modes of transport. &nbsp; &ldquo;We are aware of the fact that these thugs intimidated, threatened and prevented MyCiTi drivers residing in Dunoon from reporting for work. We have anecdotal evidence that other residents from Dunoon suffered the same fate,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp; Herron called on those with information about the attacks to contact police or the Transport Information Centre on 0800 65 64 63. &nbsp; He said police were currently investigating a number of cases relating to the vandalism of MyCiTi infrastructure. &nbsp; The transport centre was also trying to set up alternative boarding arrangements and stops to help commuters while the affected stations remained closed. &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
