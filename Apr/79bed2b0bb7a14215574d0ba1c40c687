Bloemfontein â€“ A case of animal abuse has been opened against a 43-year old Free State man who left his dog for dead, allegedly because he couldn't stand the animal. According to the Bloemfontein SPCA, the man tied a nylon rope so tightly around the dog's neck that it physically carved into the skin of the animal. It was found with the rope tied around its neck and attached to a washing pole. "The dog was already busy rotting," the SPCA said in a statement. "In some places maggots were already visible." The dog was confiscated from the man who allegedly said he did it because he could not stand the dog.The dog was taken to a vet where it is currently undergoing intensive treatment. The SPCA said that it was unacceptable for a human to treat an animal this way. "This is a typical case of wilful animal abuse and the man needs to be brought before a court."
