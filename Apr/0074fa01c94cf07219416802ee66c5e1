Attacks on our staff, as well as the SAPS, are becoming far too commonplace," he said."The public is quick to point fingers at the enforcement agencies about not doing their jobs, yet when officers try to act, we see the type of response we did yesterday [Sunday]."Officers arrested 26 people for drunk driving. In relation to the stoning incident, they arrested five others for malicious damage to property and riotous behaviour.Thirty vehicles were suspended and 315 fines were issued. Offences included speeding, and unlicensed drivers and vehicles."We have worked closely with Killarney to create a weekly drag racing event that is sponsored by the City, so the drag-racers no longer have an excuse to claim that there is no legal venue where they can practise their sport," said Smith."There is a legal venue once a week that is growing in popularity and attracting larger and larger crowds."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
