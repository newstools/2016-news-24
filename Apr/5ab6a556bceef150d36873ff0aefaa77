Kathrada's letter came in the wake of the Constitutional Court ruling that found that Zuma and Parliament flouted the Constitution by ignoring the Public Protector's findings on Nkandla. It also found that Zuma must pay for the upgrades.Eppa has since requested a meeting with Kathrada.&ldquo;Kathrada was incarcerated on Robben Island with us. He taught us about organisational discipline, the principles of belonging to a political organisation and how to defend the revolution and its gains,&rdquo; Masemola said.&ldquo;We are surprised that a man who taught us all of these things has chosen to abstain from the very same principles that he was preaching by going to the media and announcing it on the media platform.&rdquo;He should have followed the channels within the ANC, Masemola argued.&ldquo;Everybody respected him, including Madiba and all of us. He chose to go to the media to express himself and disregard the organisational structures of the ANC. We have a problem with that.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
