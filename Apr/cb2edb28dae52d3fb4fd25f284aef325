General secretary of Hospersa,&nbsp;Noel Desfontaines, said the nurse was attacked by the relative of a patient who had died on Saturday. The nurse had cared for the dying patient at the Odi Hospital in Mabopane, north of Gauteng. "The reason for the anger was that there were visitors around when the patient was discovered dead," Desfontaines said.&nbsp; He said that one family member slammed the nurse's head against a wall and started strangling her. The nurse died after the attack. "Hospersa bemoans the circumstances that led to this dangerous situation," Desfontaines said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
