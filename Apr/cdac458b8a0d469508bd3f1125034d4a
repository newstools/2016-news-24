The small group protested against the Regulation of Interception of Communications and Communication-Related Information Act (Rica). Sitting outside Parliament for two hours, the group presented a joint statement, endorsed by 38 organisations, including Equal Education, the United Front and Media for Justice. "Evidence is mounting that these surveillance capabilities have been used to target investigative journalists, political activists, unionists, and interfere in South Africa’s politics and public life. "Many of these abuses are possible because RICA lacks transparency or adequate safeguards, and because the most powerful mass surveillance capabilities are not regulated by Rica at all," the group said in their statement. They demanded that the state drop sim card registrations, end mass storage of data and strengthen judicial protection against surveillance. They also called for greater transparency. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
