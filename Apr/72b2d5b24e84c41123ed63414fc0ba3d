Equally, when there are ructions within the church, as is the case presently in the IPHC, it is the responsibility of journalists to reflect this to society," Sanef said."Just as church members welcome the coverage of their pilgrimages to Zuurbekom, similarly they should accept that the realities of conflict within their church will be covered as a matter of public interest.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
