He still has a lot of work to do, that&rsquo;s why he wants to get well as soon as possible." At the event, Sello Mlangeni read his father&rsquo;s acceptance speech. In it, Mlangeni - who turns 91 in May - called on everyone in the country to work together and remember those who fought for a free and democratic South Africa. Honouring him with the Freedom of the City would be in vain unless the beneficiaries of the new democracy upheld the ideals and beliefs his comrades had espoused, and which were enshrined in the Constitution, he said. Sello Mlangeni said he had discussed the state of the country and politics in South Africa with his father. "He is a very disciplined member of the ANC, with a long vision that the future is still bright. "We might have these moments of difficulties that we are facing, but nothing is impossible, that we cannot overcome it. What we need to do is sit and discuss and engage whatever situation we are facing and come out of it as a strong party again," Sello Mlangeni said.He said his father believed the ANC would remain a strong organisation. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
