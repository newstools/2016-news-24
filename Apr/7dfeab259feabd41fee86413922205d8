This was in the light of continued uncertainty regarding the validity of the roll where voters&rsquo; addresses are not in the possession of the Electoral Commission.The fate of the current voters&rsquo; roll will be decided by the Constitutional Court.In February, the commission was forced to postpone 12 by-elections that had been scheduled in KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, North West and the Western Cape after the Electoral Court ordered the postponement of by-elections in Tlokwe, North West.Six independent candidates there had hauled the commission before the court, arguing that the voters&rsquo; roll was defective.About two-thirds of registered voters currently have partial or no address details captured on the voters&rsquo; roll, the commission said.As the commission waits for the Constitutional Court to hand down its ruling on the appeal, the commission has to also set a date for the 2016 municipal elections, which, in terms of the Constitution, must be held between May 18 and August 16 this year.The commission&rsquo;s spokesperson, Kate Bapela, said it had briefed the Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs minister and MECs on the impact of the Electoral Court ruling on the inclusion of addresses on the certified voters&rsquo; roll for by-elections, and the risk of the results of by-elections being set aside pending clarity on the matter from the Constitutional Court.She said the commission would review the postponement of by-elections once judgment was handed down. &ldquo;In the meantime, the commission is urging all registered voters to use the opportunity of this weekend&rsquo;s final registration opportunity to visit their voting station to confirm and update their address details ahead of the 2016 municipal elections,&rdquo; she said.Election Monitoring Network board chairperson Nkosikhulule Nyembezi said the date for the local government elections could be pushed back by the delayed by-elections.&ldquo;They will need to get the by-elections out of the way first,&rdquo; he said.Nyembezi said the matter was complicated by not knowing the exact date the judgment would be delivered on.&ldquo;Not knowing the date for the constitutional judgment makes it difficult to set the date for the elections.&rdquo;Nyembezi said he was confident the commission would be able to hold the elections within the legislated timeframe.&ldquo;Preparations for local government elections have started already, so it should not be an issue for them, provided the judgment in the Constitutional Court has been handed down,&rdquo; he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
