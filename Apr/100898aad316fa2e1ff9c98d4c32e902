One son also died while another remains under treatment in Monrovia. In a rare piece of good news since Ebola's reappearance, an 11-year-old girl left the centre on April 8 after a successful recovery, according to ALIMA.The World Health Organization was first alerted to the reappearance of Ebola symptoms in a Guinean village near the Liberian border on March 16, the same day it declared a similar flare-up over in Sierra Leone.Since then eight people have died, all in the same area, while the country's Ebola response unit confirmed Thursday that more than 1 700 people have been vaccinated against the virus. The WHO has said Ebola no longer constitutes an international emergency, but the announcement of new cases in west Africa has demonstrated the difficulty of managing its aftermath. The deadliest period in the history of the feared tropical virus wrecked the economies and health systems of the three worst-hit west African nations - Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia - after it emerged in December 2013. The virus has since claimed 11 300 lives.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
