Some of the chickens have been feeding on the carcasses. Animals that deteriorate will also be culled, he said.The owner of the farm received R15 million from government to start the farm in 2010.The last delivery of food was made on 23 March and there is also no proper water supply. Each chicken should weigh about three kilograms, but they weigh between 700 grams and 800 grams, said Muller.The main purpose of the chickens is for egg-laying and the culls are sold as live , according to Muller.There is no abattoir and it is unclear where slaughtering takes place. The farm is in a terrible state. Chicken houses are not cleaned and it seems as though the farm has not been maintained in years, he said.The owner of the farm, MC Mkhungo, was contacted for comment several times, but calls were either ended or went unanswered .24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
