Jeff Wicks, News24 Durban - KwaZulu-Natal detectives are probing the bloody slaying of a woman whose decapitated body was found dumped in the dense bush of Shongweni on Monday night. The woman, who remains unidentified, was completely naked and both her hands had also been severed. A police source with knowledge of the investigation, who could not be named, said that officers were investigating the possibility of a "body dump". "From what we gathered at the scene, it is likely that the woman was murdered elsewhere and then her body was dumped in the bush," he said. "A scholar had been walking on a path nearby and smelt the decomposition and managed to find the body. We had called in the police search and rescue unit to help with the removal of the body," he said. Officers had, in the damp and wet conditions, clambered up a steep hill in thick bush to find the decapitated body. He added that K9 unit officers would now search the area to see if they could find the womanâ€™s head and hands. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Nqobile Gwala said that no arrests had yet been made. In another incident, search and rescue unit officers recovered the body of a newborn baby which had been dumped in a bin in the city centre. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
