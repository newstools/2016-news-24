"They must go to school. No child should be found at home or doing household chores during school time."Malawi has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world, with statistics indicating that one in two girls will be married before reaching the age of 18.&nbsp;In less urbanised zones of the country, statistics can be even higher, with poor parents often feeling pressurised to "sell off" their daughters in exchange for dowry, according to&nbsp;Unicef&nbsp;&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
