The girl died in hospital as a result of her injuries. Police spokesperson Major Thulani Zwane said that an arrest was imminent. "The suspect is known to us and we expect to have an arrest soon," he said. Zwane said that the grisly incident had played out on Tuesday at the KwaMoyane Reserve in northern KwaZulu-Natal, near Pongola. "The father of the 3-month-old baby arrived at the mother’s home in KwaMoyana Reserve and demanded to take the baby with him to his place," he said. "The mother refused and he became angry, he took the child by force and allegedly threw her on the floor. The child sustained head injuries and was taken to hospital in a critical condition," Zwane added. The child died hours later. "A case of murder has been opened at KwaMsane police station for investigation. The suspect fled the scene after incident and is still at large," Zwane said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
