The application was made by Ralph Stanfield, who applied to have Zach Crescent named after his uncle Colin Stanfield. According to the report to the committee, it was recommended that the application be refused on the grounds that it&nbsp;was insensitive, offensive or hurtful. This was because Stanfield was the alleged leader drug cartel The Firm, and was imprisoned for tax evasion. He was released shortly before his death in 2004 of lung cancer. No public participation phase was&nbsp;entered into&nbsp;in light of the recommendation.The area, which is currently only partially developed, is a semi-security development and the road is privately owned, Muanda said."The road in question is a cul-de-sac in the development. It is not a public road."It is the right of the owner of the development to name it after [whom he chooses]."In his motivation to the town planning department, Muanda said the current name, Zach Crescent, was named after the previous developer&rsquo;s son, and the current owner wanted to be afforded the chance to&nbsp;name it after his uncle.The naming committee has placed the matter on its agenda and would make a recommendation to the mayor for final approval.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
