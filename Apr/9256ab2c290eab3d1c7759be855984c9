"Even though we know it&rsquo;s a process to train these members, knowing they are going to be part of SAPS in this province in itself is something we need to be positive about," Jula said.In addition, he was also doing a headcount of the province&rsquo;s existing members in a bid to see how best to use the current force.Optimal utilisation of police"I believe, having resources is important, but the optimal utilisation is just as important," Jula said."Members focused on other priorities are being rechannelled to form part of day-to-day duties in [areas such as] Khayelitsha, Nyanga, Mitchells Plain and Cape Town Central, which are high volume stations," he said.But it was also important for the communities to protect those who were at their service from cop killings, Jula pointed out.Police were retraining officers to "sharpen their skills" to recognise potential attacks, he said.But while an officer may be operationally vigilant, it was psychologically taxing for them to work in an area where there was a high probability of being targeted."As a human being, if you are always expecting it to happen, you can try to be proactive and avert an attack, but in that process you may become an attacker yourself," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
