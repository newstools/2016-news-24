Amanda Khoza, News24 Durban – A KwaZulu-Natal man was granted R10 000 bail in the Durban Magistrate’s Court for allegedly dealing drugs in Umhlanga Rocks, the Hawks said on Thursday. KZN Hawks spokesperson, Lieutenant Simphiwe Mhlongo, said the man was expected to return to court in June.  Mhlongo said the 40-year-old man was arrested by the Hawks and the Crime Intelligence Unit on Wednesday.  He said the arrest was as a result of a year-long investigation after information relating to the illegal activity was gathered through police intelligence. The man has been charged with drug dealing. “The suspect was arrested soon after selling cocaine to an undercover police officer,” Mhlongo said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
