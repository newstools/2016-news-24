However, when asked to break down what the funds would be used for at each of the lavatories, Naik said the departement would have to work on a more detailed report.&ldquo;Things have most definitely changed in four years. How can we work with a four-year-old report?&rdquo; asked DA Exco member Bill Lambert.Lambert said the upgrading and maintaining of public toilets needed to be treated &ldquo;as urgent as possible&rdquo;.The report to council also recommended that patrons be charged a nominal fee to use the facilities and that they should be closed at the end of business every day.However, councillors disagreed, saying that public toilets should cater for everyone, and should take into account those who cannot afford it.&ldquo;Even in developed cities, people do not pay to use the public toilets. They pay to use the private toilets. If we close the toilets at a certain time, it would push people to break certain by-laws and answer the call of nature elsewhere,&rdquo; said Ndlela.Council agreed to remove the recommendation that patrons should be charged to spend a penny and asked the department to return to council with an updated report.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
