It is understood that a woman had been walking her Jack Russell in the gorge and had taken the dog off its leash. The dog had then wandered close to the edge of a steep cliff and had fallen into the bush below. RescueTech spokesperson Nick Holmes said that volunteers had&nbsp;gone to the scene where the dog had disappeared. "This morning, a lady took her dog for a walk and she let it off the lead and it walked over the edge of a cliff. SACAN [South African Community Action Network] asked us to lend a hand and our guys went out and abseiled in and they [are] currently searching for the dog," he said. Holmes said that search would likely continue well into the afternoon.Last year, the same group of volunteers spent hours excavating tons of earth at a house in Phoenix after a puppy named Titus fell&nbsp;into an exposed drain pipe. He was reunited with his owner. &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
