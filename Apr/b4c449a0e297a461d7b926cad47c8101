Masipa granted the State leave to appeal her ruling that the former Paralympian was guilty of culpable homicide."She did not deny NPA leave to appeal, she said go for it," Hani said."That's what I call somebody who gave a judgment with no agendas. She was confident that her judgment, as far as she was concerned, was fair."But this one, it's so interesting, she denied the minister leave to appeal. It means she is not confident about her decision, that's what I am saying. I wish she could be mentored by Judge Masipa." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
