It was established in 2010 to facilitate the achievement of the NDP, a long-term vision for South Africa.It was important for the youth to take part in the process as they would be the ones inheriting the NDP."We are hoping that through engagements, that each South African will make a contribution to put their shoulder to the wheel, to realise the objectives of this NDP," he said.President Jacob Zuma appointed the first group of commissioners in 2010, and the second group in September last year.The commission's deputy chair, Professor Malegapuru Makgoba, said the first commission's job was to develop a mission and a plan, which they had done. The job now was to realise these aims.Every government department had committed to implementing the NDP's 14 goals. About 47% of the goals had been implemented already, Makgoba said."I'm not saying they've been successfully implemented or not, but they are being implemented. What we actually need to drill down is 'what are we implementing? What is the quality of that implementation? Is it well done or is it poorly done?&rdquo;Makgoba said the national budget needed to be aligned with the plan.The NDP's goals include eliminating the number of households with a monthly income of less than R419 per person from the current 39%, reducing the Gini coefficient (a measure of inquality) from 0.69 to 0.6, and reducing unemployment.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
