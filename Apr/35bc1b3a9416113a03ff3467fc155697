News24 Correspondent Johannesburg - The Democratic Alliance on Wednesday expressed its displeasure over a tender issued for the lease of a VIP aircraft by Armscor. "We believe that such a procurement is wasteful and an insult to poor South Africans," said DA MP Kobus Marais in a statement. The tender – posted on the Armscor website last Friday and closing for applications on May 4 – calls for the "lease of an intercontinental VIP Aircraft". Further tender details from Armscor, the the defence ministry's procurement agency, are not available publicly. However, according to the Democratic Alliance, a request for information issued last year "stipulated a luxurious aircraft with an interior that meets VVIP standards and has a range of 5 500 nautical miles non-stop with 18 passengers on-board, or 7 200 nautical miles non-stop with 30 passengers on-board". Marais said the DA would submit questions to Parliament about various aspects of the tender. While he classified the craft as destined to be a "new presidential jet", comment from the Presidency to clarify this was not immediately available. In November last year, controversy arose over reports that a tender was out for a R4bn jet which would be used by President Jacob Zuma. At the time, the Presidency said it would ask the defence department about the alleged planned acquisition.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
