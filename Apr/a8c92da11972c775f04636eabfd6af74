They operate at night, attracting the shoaling fish with lights and scooping them up in dip nets."Climate change is threatening the industry and some people have moved off fishing," Chiringa said."In the last few months, there were very few rigs who managed to catch a ton in a month where in the past they could catch up to four tons within a month."The low water levels have dried up business, Hakurotwi Shonhiwa, chair of the Indigenous Kapenta Fishers' Association on the Zimbabwean side of the lake, told AFP."There is no profit and people are just fishing for survival."Fisherman Wonder Dipuka says his family faces starvation unless the water rises.In a country saddled with massive unemployment, Dipuka earns a living and pays school fees for his children through fishing, but the low water levels have left him struggling to catch enough to put a meal on the table."It's now very difficult to survive because there are no jobs in Kariba," he said, while fishing from the shore and watching for any hint of a bite at the end of his line. Dipuka said that with an average daily catch of 20kg), he could pocket $40 a day, but now he can barely catch one kilogramme.BlackoutsThe region's severe drought has been caused largely by poor rains due to the El Nino weather phenomenon. And the hardships from low water levels stretch far beyond the shores of Lake Kariba.Located 400km) downstream from the Victoria Falls, the dam feeds water to two hydroelectric stations capable of generating 750 megawatts of electricity for Zimbabwe and 600 MW for Zambia.The Zambezi River Authority is rationing the flow of water used for power generation and at the current rate it will last just five months, CEO Munodawafa said.But he ruled out a total shut-down of the power generators."Although we don't expect a vast increase in the water volume, a complete shut-down is not likely," Munodawafa said. "We may have to further ration."Heightened rationing means more blackouts in both countries.Zimbabwe is already suffering from perennial shortages, forcing the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) to cut power to some parts of the country for up to 10 hours at a time.ZESA spokesperson Fullard Gwasira said the authority had adopted "mitigatory measures" including power imports and turning to alternative energy sources to maintain local supplies.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
