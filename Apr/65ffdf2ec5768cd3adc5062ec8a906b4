Cape Town – There is nothing wrong in working with any
registered, legally trading business in South Africa, whether it's with the
Guptas or others, the Denel board of directors said on Saturday. This follows allegations that the board “brought the
Gupta family into Denel”. City Press reported last week that Denel has awarded VR
Laser a contract for cutting steel for the army’s new combat vehicles. Ajay Gupta’s son Kamal Kant Singhala, 24, is reportedly
the director of VR Laser. The board said Denel Asia comprises VR Laser Asia and
Denel. “VR Laser Asia has direct relations with VR Laser South
Africa and has been doing business with Denel for more than a decade prior to
the current board coming into office,” the board said. VR Laser South Africa’s work at Denel includes the steel
cutting and fabrication contract on Project Hoefyster, which is said was
awarded before the current board took office. The project is for 238 Badger Infantry Combat vehicles and
was awarded to Denel in November 2013, City press reported. The board confirmed the total value of the project is
R12.7bn. VR Laser's steel fabrication and cutting component
make up R400m of the amount, Denel said. City Press reported VR Laser registered a “controversial
joint venture with Denel Asia in Hong Kong” in January. Denel said it has established “many cross-border
companies and concluded partnerships with foreign entities before” and these
partnerships contributed to its “successful business turnaround and
sustainability of the company evidenced by an order book of more than
R20bn”. Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan reportedly found that
Denel’s “partnership” with the Guptas was illegal as the agreement did not have
the approval of the Treasury. The board said Denel executives are “in ongoing contact
with National Treasury clarifying Denel’s legal compliance in establishing
Denel Asia”.
