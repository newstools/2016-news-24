Johannesburg – Yet another Zuma family member has been found to apparently have close financial ties with the controversial Guptas. This time it’s one of President Jacob Zuma’s wives, City Press reported on Sunday. The newspaper reports that questions were raised in 2012 about whether the Guptas helped First Lady Bongi Ngema-Zuma secure a R3.84m home loan from an Indian state-owned banking and financial services company. The allegation was denied but now City Press reports that there may have been some truth to it. The home loan was reported to be for a R5.2m home in Pretoria’s upmarket Waterkloof Ridge suburb. The residence was bought in 2010 and belongs to Sinqumo Trust. The only disclosed trustee is the first lady, City Press reports. The Guptas and the Zumas have long had close ties. Zuma’s son Duduzane, 33, started as a 22-year-old trainee at Guptas’ Sahara Computers and is now a shareholder in several of their companies, Fin24 reports. One of Zuma’s wives used to work for Gupta-controlled JIC Mining Services, the engineering contractor, while his daughter, Duduzile, was a director at Sahara. But the connections allegedly go far deeper than merely business. Allegations emerged in March that the Guptas had offered Cabinet positions to various politicians. Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas said he was offered the job of his then senior, Nhlanhla Nene when he was removed in December last year, News24 reported. The Guptas denied the claim.
