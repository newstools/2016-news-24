	     Kano - A human rights lawyer says the detained leader of Nigeria's Shi'ite Muslims has been left half blind and underwent several operations to remove bullets from gunshots suffered in an army raid on his home. Lawyer Femi Falana spoke after he was granted access to Ibraheem Zakzaky for the first time since he and his wife were detained in December with multiple gunshot wounds and denied access to their own doctors and family. Falana on Friday gave AP a copy of a letter dated April 5 to the director general of Nigeria's secret service, the Department of State Security, demanding "the unconditional release" of the couple from "unlawful detention." Human rights groups say the military killed unknown hundreds of Shi'ites in three days of raids in the northern Zaria town. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
