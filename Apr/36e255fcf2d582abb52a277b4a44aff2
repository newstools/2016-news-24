Tammy Petersen, News24 Cape Town - Drugs with an estimated street value of R2.6m were found hidden in a light delivery vehicle in the Karoo, resulting in the arrest of a Nigerian man for drug dealing, Western Cape police said on Wednesday. The haul was discovered when officers pulled over the "suspicious" vehicle for an inspection at 01:00 on Tuesday, spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel André Traut said.  One kilogram of cocaine was found hidden in a false compartment of the chassis. A more thorough search revealed 1kg of cocaine and 5.2kg of tik hidden in compartments under the canopy. A 39-year-old Nigerian man living in Dunoon, Cape Town, was arrested for drug dealing and would appear in court once charged. The bust and the arrest were a major blow to the drug trade, Traut said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
