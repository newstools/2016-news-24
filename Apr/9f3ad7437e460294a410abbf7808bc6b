The opposition says it abhors the lack of an independent electoral commission as well as the regime's grip on the media.Another FOD member, Guillermo Nguema Ela, has branded the election "anti-constitutional".Obiang and his government "do not respect either the constitution or the law", Ela said in March.But as he kicked off his re-election bid, Obiang sent a chilling warning against staying away from polling stations."I am the candidate of the people. Whoever does not vote for me is rejecting peace and opting for disorder," he said at a rally in the capital Malabo."Many say that they are tired of seeing me, it's been 36 years already. True, but I've dedicated my life to this country," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
