WATCHCape Town &ndash; Following the destruction of more Metrorail trains on Friday, the City of Cape Town has deployed additional MyCiti buses to the Cape Flats.The buses would be deployed on the N2 Express route between Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha and Cape Town to assist commuters affected by the expected delays in the train service on Monday.Mayoral committee member for Transport for Cape Town (TCT), Brett Herron, condemned the destruction of train carriages on Friday evening at the Kraaifontein staging yard, as well as at Cape Town Station and Woodstock Station.&ldquo;The sabotage of the service by illegal strikers and the longstanding issues with Metrorail&rsquo;s infrastructure &ndash; among which are defective signal systems and point detection, as well as electrical malfunction &ndash; must be addressed as a matter of urgency,&rdquo; Herron said.He was concerned with the effect the destruction could have on the local economy and congested roads as the delays forced commuters to make use of private vehicles or other road-based private vehicles.According to Herron, the City&rsquo;s Transport Information Centre received 8 297 calls on Friday, as opposed to the 4 887 on the previous Friday.Stranded passengersAnother 6 000 calls were received on Saturday, mostly related to the delays and commuters being stranded and not knowing how to get home or to work.Golden Arrow Bus Service (GABS) have been requested to provide additional buses to prevent commuters from being stranded or delayed.
