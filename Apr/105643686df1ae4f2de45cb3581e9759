"In recent years, less invasive surgical approaches have been developed by which heart valve repairs or replacements can be performed through very small incisions ['keyhole surgery'], with the aid of cameras and without the need to split the breastbone or create any bony fractures in order to perform the operation," Jacobs said. The&nbsp;procedure was led by Dr Jacques Scherman.Scherman specialises in heart surgery and trained in Switzerland for two years.&nbsp;Since 2013, he has done about 100 minimal-invasive open heart surgeries.&nbsp;"This surgical procedure results in less surgical trauma. This leads to faster recovery times and eventually cost savings for the hospital," Sherman said.Western Cape Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo said she was excited by the hospital&rsquo;s latest achievement. "The tradition of innovation continued by healthcare workers at Groote Schuur Hospital exemplifies what we mean by providing quality healthcare to the people of the Western Cape," Mbombo said.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
