The islands had historically been Saudi and were "leased" to Egypt in 1950.Common interestAnalysts said Salman's visit puts to rest months of reports in Saudi and Egyptian media of strained ties between the two countries over Cairo's unwillingness to participate fully in Saudi-led operations against Iran-backed Shi'ite Huthi rebels in Yemen.Egypt had announced it would back Saudi Arabia with ground forces if needed, but appears to have baulked at sending troops for fear of becoming mired in the conflict."The two countries realise that common interests outweigh their practical differences," said Fawaz Gerges, professor of Middle East politics at the London School of Economics and Political Science.Following Salman's visit, Egypt would now be expected to offer more vocal support for Saudi Arabia when it comes to Iran and Yemen, he said."The Egyptians are basically going to convince the Saudis that they are in the same trench when it comes to the Saudis' existential fight with Iran, and Saudi Arabia too seems to be very committed to Egyptian national security and the Sisi adminstration," said Gerges.Since he ousted Morsi in 2013, Saudi Arabia has supported former army chief Sisi.Riyadh viewed Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood movement with deep suspicion.Saudi support for Cairo has helped Sisi tighten his grip on Egypt after he crushed not just the Brotherhood but also secular dissidents.Pumped billionsHundreds of supporters of Morsi have been killed and tens of thousands jailed in a blistering police crackdown.Hundreds more including Morsi himself have been sentenced to death or lengthy jail terms after often speedy trials that have been condemned by the United Nations and global rights groups.Prior to Salman's visit, Riyadh had already pumped billions of dollars in aid and investment into Egypt. It has helped prop up Egypt's economy, whose tourism industry has been devastated by years of political turmoil and jihadist attacks."Although Saudi Arabia's support is important to confront Egypt's economic crisis, what Egypt needs is more political stability and security to attract tourism and foreign direct investments," said Ibrahim El-Ghitany, a researcher at Cairo-based Regional Centre for Strategic Studies.Egypt's economy, which is heavily dependent on tourism, was dealt a body blow when ISIS downed a Russian airliner over the Sinai Peninsula on October 31.All 224 people on board, mostly Russian tourists, were killed in the attack which ISIS said was carried out by stowing a bomb on the aircraft.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
