Cape Town â€“ EFF leader Julius Malema would not attend
this week's community interactions after the death of his aunt, Nurse Malema,
the party said on Tuesday. Nurse Malema was a keen supporter of the EFF and helped
build it, the EFF said in a statement. "The EFF has lost a dedicated ground force,
organiser and fighter who, out of her own volition and passion for the cause,
worked daily to build our movement." Malema died on Monday after a short illness. "She will be dearly missed by all fighters, in
particular the community of Seshego where she was active and based," the
EFF said. Only two EFF MPs were present for the department of rural
development and land reform's budget vote debate on Tuesday. Once Nthako Matiase had delivered his speech, he and
fellow EFF MP, Makoti Khawule, left. Malema would still attend the party's manifesto launch at
Orlando Stadium, Soweto, on Saturday. The EFF wanted the current land reform programme to be
sped up, and believed that compensation should not be necessary for
expropriation.
