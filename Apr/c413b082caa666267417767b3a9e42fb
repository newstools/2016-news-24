	     Mombasa - A diplomatic row between Kenya and Tanzania may be brewing after Tanzania released 74 Ethiopians who had just finished their jail sentences in the country and dropped them at the Kenyan border in Taveta.  The ex-convicts were released on Tuesday.  Tanzanian authorities dropped them in Kenya instead of deporting them to their mother country. Kenyan immigration officers at the border condemned the act and threatened to send them back to Tanzania. The officers said Kenya would not take over Tanzania's burden under international law, Standard reported. This came a few days after Kenya deported 8 Taiwanese citizens who had been acquitted of wire fraud charges to China where they were held for three days, resulting in an ugly row between the two countries.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
