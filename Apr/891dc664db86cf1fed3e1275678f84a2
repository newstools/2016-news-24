Niekerk, said Billy was someone who knew how to work with people and treated
everyone as equals. “Billy was an enthusiastic and motivated man who didn’t care
what your background was,” Van Niekerk said. “He never decided how he was going to treat people based on
the amount of money they had or what their skin colour was. He treated everyone
with respect and was respected in the remote areas because he didn’t treat
people differently.” Van Niekerk said that on the evening of the attacks he
received a message about the incident and forwarded it to all of the neighbourhood
watch groups before heading to the farm to check on the family. “I went to the house to support the family members that
survived the attack while other members of the community searched the area for
the suspects.”  Van Niekerk said that the family is extremely traumatised
and struggling with what happened. Billy and his father-in-law, Ronnie Lombard, were shot by a
group of armed men carrying AK47’s on Tuesday. The men reportedly wanted money. Van Rooyen reportedly died on the way to the hospital and
Lombard succumbed to his injuries early on Wednesday morning. It was understood that more than 50 spent bullet casings
were recovered at the scene. Police spokesperson, Major Thulani Zwane, on Wednesday told
News24 that six suspects were taken in for questioning, but were released on
the basis that no evidence were found against them. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
