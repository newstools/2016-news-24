Genevieve Quintal, News24Johannesburg - The Zionist Christian Church is investigating a man who apparently claimed to represent the church at a meeting between the SA Council of Churches and ANC officials.The man, who was wearing a T-shirt with the ZCC logo on it, was part of a group of religions leaders calling for President Jacob Zuma to step down."We would like to categorically state it for the record that the person in question was not mandated nor appointed by the ZCC to represent it in that forum," the ZCC said in a statement on Tuesday."We would like to reiterate our long-standing and inelastic policy that the ZCC is above politics. This, because we believe that as a church, among our primary responsibilities is to pray for peace and stability."The church was verifying the man's membership.The SACC met four of the ANC's top six officials on Friday, where it asked them to convince Zuma to resign. This followed the Constitutional Court&acute;s ruling last month that Zuma failed to uphold the Constitution when he ignored Public Protector Thuli Madonsela&acute;s remedial action that he repay some of the money spend on so-called security upgrades to his private Nkandla homestead.SACC general secretary Bishop Malusi Mpumlwana said ANC officials were facing mounting pressure."We need to appreciate that this is not an easy call to make. We could feel and sense the pain within the ANC delegation because they are wrestling with the same issue. We recognised that much of our own congregations are also members of ANC. The pain is felt across the board."The ANC officials were not able to respond directly to the request. The SACC wanted the ANC to "assist" Zuma&acute;s resignation, but not force him to step down.The ZCC said it did not believe people should judge as only God could. It urged citizens to pray for the country.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
