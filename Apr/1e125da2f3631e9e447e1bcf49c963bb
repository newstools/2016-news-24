Another 70 horses in the area had been tested and cleared.&nbsp;The transport of horses on roads that formed the borders of the containment area was permitted.&nbsp; The revised containment zone is: Following the fatality, vets visited all properties with horses within 5km of the farm and tested about 200 horses. About 90% of results had been received to date, all of which were negative for the virus.&nbsp;Surveillance within the containment area was continuing.
