Unidentified sources revealed that Lucia Pedro, 31, allegedly brutally assaulted her domestic helper Tazorodzwa Takavada with an electric cable after noticing her coming out of the toilet with chillies. Pedro asked what she was doing with the chillies, and Takavada divulged that she intended to use them for an abortion. This allegedly stirred up Pedro's curiosity about the father of the unborn baby, but Takavada refused to tell her who he was. Later, Pedro used an electric cord to beat her all over the body. Takavada reportedly died the following day after she went to bed complaining about being weak. Takavada's death came just less than four months after a teenage boy was arrested for killing her family's helper over a memory card. According to the state-owned Chronicle newspaper, the 14-year-old boy kept the woman’s body inside his family home for about 20 hours. The teenage boy reportedly used a hoe handle to beat the maid to death. The boy was later admitted to a hospital after he tried to commit suicide when neighbours called the police. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
