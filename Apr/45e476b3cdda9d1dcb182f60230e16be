She believed the country would forgive him in time."South Africans are forgiving people. We have seen that before, but we do not take the electorate for granted," she said.Jordaan told reporters there was no way the ANC was going to lose Nelson Mandela Bay on August 3. The DA and the EFF have vowed to unseat the ANC."The majority of the people of this metro are saying 'this is our ANC, we love it'. The team in yellow is very strong and is dominating."Dlodlo said the ANC was able to reflect on its mistakes and correct itself.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
