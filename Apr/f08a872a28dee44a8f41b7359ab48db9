Provincial police believed the turf war between gangs originated from an incident in Manenberg on the morning of March 1.Officers found a man lying on the ground with a gunshot wound to the arm. He identified the shooter, as he was running away and an arrest followed.Fights over turfAlthough police could not release numbers, there had been an increase in the number of deaths caused by gang violence.Jula said gangsterism had existed on the Cape Flats for a long time.&nbsp;"It is a problem caused, amongst other things, by fights over specific turfs and territories. That is not the only reason," he said. It also had to do with the moral fibre of society being eroded and the need for better early childhood development.&nbsp;"We are of the view that, from the side of the community, they should be exercising better control over their children," said Jula.
