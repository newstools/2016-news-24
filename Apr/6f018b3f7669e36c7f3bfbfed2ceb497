He lambasted them for the platform in which they chose to criticise the party's dilemma."When stalwarts opt to sprint to media and play into opposition hands instead of raising their dissatisfaction within the organisation, and guiding our action, how are we to continue respecting them?" he asked.He accused them of entering muddy water and throwing mud at the ruling party.One of the said stalwarts was former President Thabo Mbeki who responded to the Constitutional Court's judgment which found that President Zuma had acted inconsistently with the Constitution by not acting on Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's recommendations that he pay back a portion of the money spent on non-security upgrades at his Nkandla homestead.In a letter published on Facebook on Monday, Mbeki did not mention Zuma by name or express an opinion on how Zuma should respond to the judgment, but praised Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng and his fellow justices on their ruling.He said the court's judgment had evoked much political discussion and activity in the country. These included the calls for Zuma to be removed from office.Chiloane on Wednesday said if Mbeki wanted to give advice to the ruling party, he should have done so through the right channels."We can't entertain him on that level, if he did [want to assist] he would have come to us."We are expecting better conduct [from him] but we are not receiving such," Chiloane said.The leagues fully supported the court's findings and appreciated the closure it brought to a matter that had dragged on for far too long, which had led to Parliament becoming a circus, Chiloane said.There have been increasing calls for the ANC to remove Zuma since the court ruled on March 31.Among them was the South African Council of Churches which asked the ANC last Friday to convince Zuma to resign.Chiloane said the leagues were shocked to hear religious leaders had opted not to accept Zuma's apology."Since when does the Bible teach non-forgiveness?" Chiloane said."Shockingly, the individuals who today teach non-forgiveness are the very people who were Apartheid activists and subsequently forgave racist and blood thirsty Apartheid activists, yet today they can't forgive a man whose fundamental error is non-payment."Chiloane urged the religious leaders not to lead people astray and remain consistent.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
