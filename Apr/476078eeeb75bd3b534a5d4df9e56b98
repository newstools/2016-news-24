	     Johannesburg - The Royal House of Mandela has welcomed the Mthatha High Court’s dismissal of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's challenge to her ex-husband, former president Nelson Mandela's, Qunu estate. Madikizela-Mandela's application for ownership of Mandela's Qunu home was dismissed on Thursday. Chief of the Royal House of Mandela, Mandla Mandela, said the ruling honoured Madiba's final wishes that the Qunu residence be managed by the executors of his estate. "Some of the Executors have been lifelong friends, trusted aides and allies. We refer specifically to Advocate George Bizos, who knew my grandfather since his school days," Mandela said. Mandela said the family was grateful that the saga had now come to a close and trusted that Madikizela-Mandela would make peace with the judgment and desist from any further actions that may be perceived as being disrespectful to Madiba’s legacy and final wishes. Madikizela-Mandela had been seeking the rights to Mandela's home in Qunu, Eastern Cape. "We are relieved that the court has left Tata Madiba’s legacy and estate intact and safe in the hands of the Executors he appointed by in his last will and testament," Mandela said. He said the residence was a symbol of hope to their family, the South African people, all who supported the International Anti-apartheid Movement, and the global community of peace loving people. "We take comfort that it is now behind us and we can focus on the real work of preserving Madiba’s legacy," Mandela said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
