Metrorail Regional Manager Richard Walker joined us in studio to shed light on the recent acts of vandalism on the service, and the ongoing battle with disgruntled employees. Watch.   WATCH Cape Town – Friday evening saw three carriages set alight at Cape Town station causing clouds of smoke to rise out of the station. Earlier the Metrorail in Cape Town said that commuters should expect a delay of up to an hour following acts of vandalism on Friday. On Friday morning, a train was set alight, while another four carriages were destroyed by a fire in Kraaifontein's staging yard. The delays would mainly affect the northern line, and commuters were asked to make use of alternative transport. "This morning's incidents of deliberate destruction follows in the wake of last Saturday's fire where two adjoining trains were set alight at platforms 11 and 12 at Cape Town station," Metrorail said in a statement. Metrorail regional manager Richard Walker expressed his unhappiness with the vandalism, saying criminals were disrupting "innocent people's only means of transport". The vandalism also included cable theft at Salt River and an apparatus case set alight at Philippi. The incident caused northern trains to be re-routed via Ysterplaat–Mutual and central trains to terminate at Philippi.
