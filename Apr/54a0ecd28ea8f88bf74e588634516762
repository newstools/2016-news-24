During a workshop hosted by the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, GALS programme officer Sylvester Nyamatendedza said the treatment that some of the group's members were receiving from government officials was negative. He said that even some sections of the local media were not reporting fairly about lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people."Members of&nbsp;GALS have experienced human violations, such as loss of employment, denial or poor service delivery, disownment by family, illegal arrest, bullying and raids due to their orientation, but we are still part of the society as we speak for equal treatment with other groups," Nyamatendedza was cited as saying. Zimbabwe remained a hugely anti-homosexual country, with its long-time&nbsp;president, Robert Mugabe, often lambasting gays and lesbians. Last year, the nonagenarian told a United Nations General Assembly that his country would not allow homosexuality. Mugabe said that gay rights were not human rights, adding that western governments should not prescribe new rights that were contrary to "our values, norms, traditions and beliefs. We are not gays". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
