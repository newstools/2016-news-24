But the very same church leaders refuse to accept his apology. It becomes suspicious then. If they refuse to accept his apology, what are they representing?&rdquo;Zuma apologised to the nation after the Constitutional Court found that his failure to comply with the public protector&rsquo;s remedial action in her report on spending on his Nkandla homestead was a breach of the Constitution."The matter has caused a lot of frustration and confusion for which I apologise on my behalf and on behalf of government," Zuma said at the time.On Friday, the council announced that it had asked the ANC to convince Zuma to resign.Quoting the BibleSACC general secretary Bishop Malusi Mpumlwana said they had met with high-ranking ANC leaders during a closed meeting at their Luthuli House headquarters on Friday morning.Mpumlwana said they were representing all religious leaders in the sector and that they had heard the pain of their constituents and Zuma needed to heed the call to resign.Masemola, however, quoting the Bible, said scripture read that a man had committed crimes "more than 70 times and was forgiven&rdquo;.&ldquo;Zuma said he made an honest mistake and accepted the call for an apology. Here [is] a man who is laying down; you can&rsquo;t kick a man laying down.&ldquo;We are quite surprised by the church&rsquo;s [stance]. The ANC government chose to forgive [former Vlakplaas commander] Eugene de Kock by giving him parole.&rdquo;In a statement at the weekend, the association also hit out at former political prisoner and former member of parliament Ahmed Kathrada, Cheryl Carolus and Trevor Manual, calling them "very bitter so-and-so's". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
