However, there was no confirmation that they were trapped inside the building.Heavy rainstorms are predicted to continue overnight, the Red Cross saying rescue efforts were expected to continue, "probably running into days."Access for rescuers with larger machinery has been made difficult by the narrow and crowded streets.One survivor was pulled from the huge pile of debris shortly after dawn, Kenya Red Cross said, some 10 hours after the building collapsed Friday night.Ignored directivesPictures broadcast by local media showed soldiers, policemen and civilians searching through the rubble.Kenyatta "braved the rainy and chilly weather" to visit the poor and densely-populated Huruma neighbourhood, a statement from the presidency said.He ordered police to "take immediate action to identify and arrest owners of buildings who have ignored directives by the National Construction Authority", it said.In other separate incidents, two people drowned when their vehicle was swept away by storm waters in the capital's Industrial Area, and another person died in floods.Nairobi has been in the midst of a building boom for some years but the quality of materials used and speed of construction have sometimes been called into question.The growing middle class has triggered an explosion in demand for housing and a rise in real estate prices in the east African capital.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
