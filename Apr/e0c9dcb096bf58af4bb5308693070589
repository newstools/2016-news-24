Well, calm does not amount to transparency," Khaireh told AFP on Saturday.The AU mission visited 124 of 456 polling stations and said instructions for voting were not always publicly posted or signed by poll officials in line with electoral laws.IrregularitiesObservers also found some booths did not systematically ratify voter registers which used indelible ink to ensure each person cast his ballot just once, according to Sako, a former Malian prime minister.Furthermore, some ballot boxes were not hermetically sealed and some booth officials sported T-shirts bearing pictures of Guelleh.The AU team also noted some booths had no opposition officials present, but added there was no sign of that absence being down to a "manoeuvre by the authorities."Guelleh, 68, won the previous election in 2011 with 80% of the vote, after parliament changed the constitution to clear the way for a third term.Djibouti lies on the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, a gateway to the Suez Canal, one of the world's busiest shipping routes. It is home to Washington's only permanent base in Africa, which is used for operations in Yemen - just across the Gulf of Aden - as well as the fight against the Islamist Shabaab in Somalia and Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
