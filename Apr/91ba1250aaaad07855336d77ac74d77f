	     Cairo – An Egyptian court has sentenced 11 men accused of
homosexuality to jail terms of between three and 12 years, legal sources said. The defendants were arrested in a flat in the leafy Cairo suburb
of Agouza in September last year. The court convicted them of "debauchery and incitement to
debauchery", the charges generally used to prosecute alleged homosexuals
in Egypt as the law does not formally prohibit same-sex relations. Late on Sunday, it sentenced three of them to 12 years, three to
nine years, one to six years and four to three years. Egypt's use of the debauchery law to prosecute and jail gay men
has drawn condemnation from human rights groups.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
