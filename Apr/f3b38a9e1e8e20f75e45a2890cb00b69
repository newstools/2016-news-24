We were going down to Africa Bike Week [in Margate on the South Coast] and were just outside Cato Ridge when she disappeared behind me.&rdquo;Breetveld said he was waiting for Goertz when a truck driver stopped and told him about the accident.&ldquo;... a truck driver said to me there&rsquo;s been a huge motorbike accident. I then knew it was her. I asked him what happened. He said all he saw she was in the right lane and then just ran off the road. She hit the barrier, somersaulted over onto the right lane going through to Pietermaritzburg.&rdquo;According to Breetveld, Goertz's bike was badly mangled.&ldquo;However, the straps on her helmet, despite hitting the ground with tremendous force, were still intact. I am not sure what happened. She didn&rsquo;t have a heart problem or anything like that. This was such a freak accident.&rdquo;Plans to retireBeetveld said he would miss Goertz &ldquo;immensely&rdquo;.&ldquo;You know she worked for Nedbank and we lived together for 10 years. We were waiting for her to retire so we could go touring overseas where her daughter and sister live.&rdquo;According to Breetveld, Goertz was an avid motorcyclist.&ldquo;I bought her that bike two and a half years ago. I am not sure what would have happened. I can tell you this much, she would not have just lost control," he said."I don&rsquo;t know if she got distracted or maybe she had some physical problem. But she was excellent at riding her bike.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
