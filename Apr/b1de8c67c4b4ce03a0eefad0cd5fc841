He said they had set up a reference group and had been going through the issues in the bill. "We are hopeful that we can have greater consensus for the bill to be reintroduced." The name of the bill could also be amended. Masutha said it was important to finalise the bill, because of the critical role it played in the justice system. Customary or indigenous law was "embedded" in the Constitution, he said. At present, all other courts found themselves adjudicating on issues arising out of customary law, he said. The ministers also touched on the hate crimes bill, which would be finalised shortly and would be opened for public comment, said Jeffery. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
