Diabetes is divided into two types. There is no known way to prevent type one, which occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin. Most people living with diabetes have type 2, which is associated with obesity and other lifestyle factors and emerges in adults and increasingly among children. To curb the intensifying burden of the disease, huge efforts were needed to change global "eating and physical activity habits," especially early in life, when key behavioural patterns are formed, WHO said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
