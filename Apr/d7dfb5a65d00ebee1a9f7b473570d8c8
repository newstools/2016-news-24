The seven MPs in the sub-committee of the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence (JSCI) had to choose their preferred candidates from a lever arch file containing 39 applications. Candidates shortlisted were: Aadvocate Unathi Bruce Bongco, Advocate Seswanthsho Godfrey Lebeya, Modesta Dianne Phillips, Dr Nyelisani Clarence Tshitereke, Professor Bruce William Watson and Brightboy Nhlakanipho Nkontwana. The post was re-advertised after previous attempts to have the former JSCI chairperson, Cecil Burgess,&nbsp;confirmed as the IGI failed.The party also decided to withdraw Burgess's name from the running.Speaking on the sidelines of the sub-committee, committee chairperson Connie September said she was not at liberty to say whether Burgess had applied in the latest round. Burgess would also not be drawn on the question when asked by News24.The MPs had been asked to pick five candidates, and the names of the six most popular candidates were selected from that list after a request that more names be added. Their names would be submitted to the JSCI for vetting and further discussion, so the names on the list could change. The IGI's job is to oversee the country's intelligence services and the post has been likened to that of the public protector.Members of the public could, for example, complain to the IGI if they suspect their telephone is being tapped.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
