The agreement follows the settlement of the industrial action on April 8 under the auspices of the CCMA. Negotiations, facilitated by the CCMA, continued throughout the week. Samwu members embarked on an unprotected strike about a month ago, demanding a minimum salary of between R9 000 and R10 000. Garbage went largely uncollected in Johannesburg during this time. CCMA Director Cameron Sello Morajane said the agreement was a victory for mediation. "Given the recent industrial action and its impact on the residents of the city of Johannesburg, this agreement can only be attributed to the commitment of parties to finding resolution under the guidance of experienced CCMA Senior Commissioners," Morajane said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
