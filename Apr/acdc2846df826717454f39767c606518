Handing down sentence in the Limpopo High Court in Polokwane, Raulinga said the victims were slaughtered like a sheep, adding that it had also deeply impacted on the community. Kekana was found guilty earlier this week after he pleaded guilty at the beginning of the trial, admitting that he had killed his four children - Bokang, 13, Keneilwe, 10, Hlologelo, 6, and Lekgoledi, 4 - at Moletlane in September last year by slitting their throats with a knife. He testified earlier that he was "saving them from enduring suffering", as he was planning to commit suicide. The court also heard earlier that Kekana, 37, killed his children after arguing with his wife Lorraine over the phone. She was made to listen to her children being murdered. The court found that the manner in which the victims were killed was inhumane and that Kekana's plea for mercy should be dismissed. The court was packed with members of the ANC Women’s League, who came to support the grieving mother. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
