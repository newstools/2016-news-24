Johannesburg â€“ Infamous cardiologist Dr Wouter Basson will hear his fate on Friday after he applied to set aside a decision by two members of the HPCSA's professional conduct committee not to recuse themselves from the proceedings against him. In December 2013, the Health Professions Council of SA's (HPCSA's) committee, headed by Professor Jannie Hugo, found Basson guilty on four counts of unprofessional and unethical conduct as a medical doctor when he headed the apartheid government's chemical and biological warfare programme between 1981 and 1992. Basson, an apartheid-era chemical warfare expert, filed the application, saying he believed the two committee members were biased. The matter was heard in the High Court in Pretoria. Perception of bias The committee found Basson acted unethically when he co-ordinated the large-scale production of illegal psychoactive drugs, equipped mortars with teargas and provided military operatives with disorientating substances to facilitate illegal cross-border kidnappings. It found he acted unethically by making cyanide for South African soldiers so they could commit suicide if captured, and that he had violated the medical ethical principle of "first do no harm". Last January, the High Court ruled that Basson was entitled to lodge a recusal application against the members of the committee and interdicted the committee from continuing in Basson's absence. The proceedings before the HPCSA had been stayed pending the application of Basson's review application. Basson alleged the conduct of Hugo and fellow committee member, Professor Eddie Mhlanga, created a perception of bias.
