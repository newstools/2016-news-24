The country's 10 provinces were yet to hand them over, News Zimbabwe said."We are reminding all provincial administrators, ministers of state and Zanu-PF provincial chairpersons to wind up their mobilisation and hand over the cattle to President Mugabe as a way of thanking him for the work he did at the African Union... We want to update the AU on the progress we have made," a businessman co-ordinating the collection of the cattle was quoted as saying by the state-owned Herald newspaper.&nbsp;Mugabe received applause for the pledge, with the AU even hailing him as an exemplary leader who demonstrated the ability of Africans to fund Africa's development.The nonagenarian was, however, ridiculed by local opposition parties which claimed that this was "a joke in very bad taste", as the country was battling with acute drought that had resulted in at least 7 000 cattle being killed. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
