A Zimbabwe woman who buried her newborn alive has told a court in the east of the country that it was because she already had a 14-month old child and couldn't afford to keep both, a report says. News24 CorrespondentHarare &ndash;&nbsp; Officials in Zimbabwe have congratulated President Robert Mugabe's daughter and her husband following reports they have had a baby boy.If confirmed, the birth would mean Mugabe had become a grandfather for the first time at age 92.Psychology Maziwisa, a Zanu-PF MP for Highfield West in Harare, posted on Facebook: "Congratulations to [Mugabe's daughter] Bona and Simba Chikore on the birth of their baby boy. I'm absolutely delighted for them.""Wishing them lots of excitement, happiness, and hopefully some sleep!" he added. Bona is Mugabe's first child with his second wife, Grace.&nbsp;Baby born to Gushungo familyThe privately-owned Standard newspaper said Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Prisca Mupfumira confirmed the birth at a ruling party meeting in Chinhoyi on Saturday.The paper quoted the minister as saying a baby boy had been born to the family of Gushungo, which is Mugabe's clan name. It was not clear exactly where Bona Mugabe and her family were, although there were suggestions they're in Dubai.There was outrage in Zimbabwe last week when Mugabe inadvertently confirmed his daughter &ndash; &nbsp;and his wife &ndash; &nbsp;were out of the country awaiting the birth. Mugabe has frequently sought medical attention in Singapore.Critics said it wasn't fair that government officials could avoid Zimbabwe's struggling public health system by travelling abroad for treatment when millions of Zimbabweans had no choice. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
