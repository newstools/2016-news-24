Durban – A group of suspects allegedly went on a stabbing spree in a bus carrying schoolchildren from Ntuzuma to Phoenix on Thursday, the Phoenix Crime Watch said. The community policing forum said in a Facebook post that several weapons were seized and handed over to the police. It was not clear what the altercation was about. "Two of the injured were treated by KZN VIP Medics and transferred to hospital. Pupils from several schools were involved," the post read. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Major Thulani Zwane said, while allegations of a disruption that led to an assault were reported, a case had not yet been opened. Provincial education spokesperson Muzi Mahlambi said, if the allegations were true, parents needed to inspect their children’s school bags more often. "They should also listen to their children when they report incidences of bullying," said Mahlambi. "They should not dismiss them, especially the boy children, because if their parents don’t take them seriously, they will take matters into their own hands."
