According to spokesperson, Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi, people who received this message fell victim to fraudsters once they replied to the message and in some cases, had money extorted from them.Mulaudzi said the first case was reported in January. Since then, however, there had been an increasing number of instances nationwide."The scam came to the SAPS's attention after a case had been reported in Rosebank, Gauteng in January. It was followed by other cases with the same modus operandi that was reported in the Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, the Free State, North West, and Limpopo," Mulaudzi said. The victims received a SMS stating a SAPS case had been opened against them and that they had to contact a Constable Baloyi at 060 800 8148. Other random names and different contact numbers were also given in other instances.After they responded to the message, they would be informed that a warrant of arrest had been issued for a traffic fine and that they needed to pay a certain amount. An account number would be given claiming they had to deposit the money into an FNB account with the number 62017066201 or an Absa account number, 4054021171."You are warned not to fall for this scam. In case you receive this kind of SMS, please contact your nearest police station," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
