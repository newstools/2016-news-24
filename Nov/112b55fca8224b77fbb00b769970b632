We apologise to the artist for our oversight in this,&rdquo; he told News24 on Thursday.Apologised His tourism, events and economic development counterpart Eddie Andrews also apologised for the inconvenience.&nbsp;He said law enforcement was usually very good with checking.He also assured Pelser that the city was fully supportive of public art and they would improve their internal processes.Applying for a permit required getting signed permission from all affected property owners.&nbsp;One of the requirements was a digital mock-up and graphic representation of the artwork at the site.&nbsp;The application then had to get feedback and comment from the sub council, different departments and community-based organisations.Pelser, who has a permit until 31 December, planned to put up the installation again.Having taken on Smith&rsquo;s legacy of the opportunity to install public art at the promenade in 2011, former Atlantic Seaboard councillor Beverly Schafer believed the space was microcosm of society.Schafer, now a member of the provincial legislature, said the promenade represented tolerance and allowing freedom of expression.&ldquo;Those spaces that we fought for for years, to actually allow some public art on the promenade, should be carefully guarded and it is a privilege,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;We have had to break down barriers so carefully.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
