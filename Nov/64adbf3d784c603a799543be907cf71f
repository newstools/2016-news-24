We can't speculate about the contents of the report, so the sooner it is released, the better."I am sure the president and others, even after the report is released, they still may take the report on review if there are procedural issues they are not happy about."Van Rooyen application struck off rollHe said the ANC was not party to the case and could not comment on the legal aspects. However, it appreciated the rights of those implicated to use whatever legal recourse they had to clear their names.On Wednesday morning, Zuma's lawyer Anthea Platt told a full bench of the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria that her instructions were to withdraw the application.On Tuesday, she had told the court that the president had found former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's report to be procedurally flawed, as she did not afford him the opportunity to respond to questions and quiz witnesses before the finalisation of the report.On the same day, Gauteng Judge President Dunstan Mlambo struck Co-operative Governance Minister Des Van Rooyen's application to interdict the report off the roll&nbsp;because of&nbsp;lack of urgency.The High Court also permitted opposition parties, who had initially applied to oppose the president's application, to join in the matter.Zuma had maintained that he did not have sufficient time to respond to questions posed by Madonsela on his relationship with the Gupta family. Madonsela was investigating claims of undue influence by the family over Zuma.Public Protector waiting for certaintyCommenting on the withdrawal on Wednesday, Madonsela said: "It appears to be the right thing to do, as there never was a basis for the application in the first instance."Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane's spokesperson Oupa Segalwe said she had to be certain that "all is clear" before the office can release the report."The [Public Protector] has noted reports that the president has withdrawn his application for an interdict," said Segalwe. "We don't have a problem releasing the report, except we need to be sure that all is clear. As you would know, there is still the application by Minister Mosebenzi Zwane to consider. We are closely following developments on that, as well as the current proceedings in court."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
