President Muhammadu Buhari said he was "worried and shocked" by the claims.Idris said police commanders had been ordered to increase security at the camps to "ensure adequate safety of all IDPs and... that all perpetrators of any criminal act are decisively dealt with in accordance with the law"."Any act that violates the human dignity of the IDPs" will not be condoned anywhere, he added.The governor of Borno state, of which Maiduguri is the capital, this week called for undercover police to patrol the camps.The Boko Haram conflict has left at least 20 000 people dead in northeast Nigeria since 2009 and forced more than 2.6 million from their homes.IDPs are also facing severe food shortages, which aid agencies say has led to high levels of severe acute malnutrition, particularly among children, and famine in some hard-to-reach areas.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
