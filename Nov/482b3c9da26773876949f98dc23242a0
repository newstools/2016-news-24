(sic).The social media sound and fury aside it remains to be seen what Malik's longer-term game plan might be, besides venting his personal grievances.However, among Obama's Kenyan relatives Malik is the black sheep.In the family's ancestral village of Kogelo, where Barack and Malik's father was born, the president's step-grandmother Sarah Obama said Trump should seek to emulate the current occupant of the White House."It is upon him to develop America and the whole world like Barack," she said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
