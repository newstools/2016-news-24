Retired Dutch general Patrick Cammaert led the investigation.The report found that a lack of leadership in the UN mission culminated in a "chaotic and ineffective response" during heavy fighting in the capital from July 8 to 11.Peacekeepers abandoned their posts and failed to respond to pleas for help from aid workers under attack in a nearby hotel compound.The fierce fighting in Juba involved helicopter gunships and tanks pitting President Salva Kiir's government forces against those loyal to ex-rebel chief Riek Machar.Russian Deputy Ambassador Petr Iliichev criticised the decision to sack Ondieki as "premature" and said it should be reconsidered.But UN peackeeping chief Herve Ladsous told reporters after a council meeting that the report's "conclusions were irrefutable" in detailing the force commander's failings.The Kenyan ambassador insisted there was a "systemic failure" at the United Nations and that responsibility lay also with the department of peacekeeping in New York and the joint command of the UN mission in Juba.The UN spokesperson however said in response that Ban has "full confidence" in Ladsous, of France.The 16 000-strong UN mission known as UNMISS has been deployed in South Sudan since its independence in 2011 and it has been sheltering civilians at designated sites since the war broke out December 2013.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
