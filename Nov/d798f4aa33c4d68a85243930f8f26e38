"You can also move that information from the handset when it is not in your possession,&rdquo; Khoza said.He also alluded to plans to expand his factory in Mpumalanga, where his smartphones and tablets are being manufactured, to create more full-time job opportunities.Thules Telecoms had already received preorders from the US, China, India, Angola, Ghana and many other countries, he said. Ghana became the first African country to place an order of about 50 000 units for the groundbreaking smartphones. Of these, 40 000 unit orders are from an Accra-based mobile supplier. Its target market is university students with a limited disposable income. The remaining 10 000 orders come from a cellphone dealer in Kwashieman, a district in Accra, who cites the competitively priced T-Touch mobile as a major attraction.The average selling price for T-Touch mobiles ranges from R149 to R299, while the cost of smartphones ranges from R599 to R4 999.The demand for a T-Touch mobile phone in South Africa has increased since Khoza went public about his product earlier this year.&ldquo;We have also received expressions of interest from Angola and other African countries,&rdquo; he said.The T-Touch mobile will be officially launched this month.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
