They are on their own."EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi managed to take a dig at Parliament's own security officials, before agreeing with Chauke about the way forward."I nearly said we have found the perfect job for those bouncers in Parliament," he joked. "But the speaker will disagree."It's simply a matter for the SAPS's witness protection, they have that programme," he continued."The chairperson can engage through the office of the Speaker for us to request protection for any witnesses that request it. We also can't impose protection."Findings in two monthsNdlozi said Parliament should want to give South Africa a sense of confidence and do something about the intimidation.He also said for those witnesses who did not want to speak in front of cameras, the committee should ensure that their safety will not be compromised.Smith&nbsp;said he didn't want to respond to knee-jerk reactions, but would take the matter forward to make sure that all witnesses were free to come and give evidence.The SABC was heavily criticised in July when it fired journalists Suna Venter, Foeta Krige, Krivani Pillay, Thandeka Gqubule, Busisiwe Ntuli, Lukhanyo Calata, Vuyo Mvoko and Jacques Steenkamp for speaking out against the broadcaster's policy to not show footage of violent protests.Subsequently, the eight journalists, who were rehired by the SABC in September following a lengthy Labour Court battle, filed papers at the Constitutional Court asking for the National Assembly to institute an inquiry into the various issues plaguing the broadcaster, including their dismissals.The committee meanwhile will begin its hearing into the broadcaster on November 29. The hearing will continue for two weeks.Thereafter MPs will deliberate in the hopes of finalising their findings before Parliament rises on January 9 in the new year.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
