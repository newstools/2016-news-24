Do you remember him saying that?" asked Price."Yes, he said that," said Siyoni.'Implicate him'Price said at one stage, when Siyoni had called Panayiotou, it was within hours of him burying Jayde. He pointed out that at the time of making the call, police officer Leon Eksteen, who had been identified by Siyoni as Panayiotou's "chommie" was with him in the office and had attended the funeral."This is Eksteen, 'Listen. Implicate him'. Is this how they dealt with you, constantly telling you to implicate him?""Yes, they said, either I go away for 25 years or get Chris," said Siyoni.Price referred to another transcript where a male voice can be heard saying in Afrikaans, "Daai ou is nou op sy fokken senewees [That guy is fucking nervous now]"."I want to ask you, there is a lot of foul language here, do you remember foul language being used?""Yes," said Siyoni.Price later read another transcript, where a male voice is heard saying, "Ok, kry daai poes [Ok, get that poes].""Whoever this person is, is referring to Christopher Panayiotou as a poes," said Price.Price put it to Siyoni that Panayiotou had not wanted to take his calls or speak to him.&nbsp; "Did it become clear that Christopher didn't want to talk to you? And yet they kept on pushing you to speak to him?" asked Price.Siyoni said he was aware of that Panayiotou did not want to talk to him, but that they had continued to pressure him to call.The trial continues.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
