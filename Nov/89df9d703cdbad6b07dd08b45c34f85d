IN celebration of 70 years of uninterrupted, profitable operation, Comair Limited has sponsored 70 trees in conjunction with Food and Trees for Africa. The trees will be planted at schools in Gauteng, the Western and Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal and provide much-needed food and shade in disadvantaged communities. One such planting event took place at Settlers Park Primary School in Port Elizabeth. Susan van der Ryst, Corporate Communications Manager of Comair, said, “It’s important for business to play a responsible role in social development. “So while we’re very proud of nearly three quarters of a century of operation, this is an opportunity to highlight the need for corporate social investment. The schools at which the trees will be planted will benefit from much-needed shading and nutritional needs, as well as enhancing the aesthetic appeal of their properties. “We chose to partner with Food and Trees for Africa as it greens, educates, offsets carbon emissions and transforms schools and other community centres into healthier, more sustainable environments.” Food and Trees for Africa (FTFA) Trees and Carbon Programme Manager, Emily Jones, said, “Comair has been a long-term supporter of FTFA’s Tree planting initiatives. It’s very encouraging to see business involved in an initiative that directly benefits underresourced communities and schools in such a profound way.” Jones added that all the schools will receive a training morning where they will be taught to plant trees for maximum survival rate and care for the trees in these water scarce conditions. “Trees have many benefits apart from carbon sequestration. Trees help to clean water, they reduce erosion and noise and they provide fruit, nuts and medicine. Very importantly, they provide habitats for wildlife and contribute to civic and school pride,”noted Jones.
