Let us work together to improve the flow of investments in both directions&hellip;," Mugabe said.&nbsp;Established on April 8, 2015, the BNC was set up to steer bilateral relations between the neighbouring countries, while seeking ways to promote and enhance co-operation in various sectors within the two governments.The heads of state and government will meet annually to monitor progress on the implementation of agreed projects. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
