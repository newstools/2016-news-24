African heads of state failed to elect a new head of the commission in July after they were unable to agree on a successor to lead the executive branch of the continental body during its 27th summit in Kigali, Rwanda.None of the three candidates at the time was able to muster the two-thirds majority required to win the secret ballot. Five contenders had shown interest in next year&rsquo;s elections.
