Mcbride returned to his job, after the National Assembly did not accede to Nhleko's request for an inquiry against the IPID head. Last week, he again wrote to the National Assembly, asking for an inquiry to allow him to suspend Mcbride.Issue did not come before intelligence committeeCommittee chairperson Charles Nqakula would not be drawn on Dintwe's affidavit when asked by News24 on Monday."This matter will be serving before Parliament tomorrow," he said."The interviews regarding the search for a new Inspector General of Intelligence happened in open session and questions like the ones at issue, should have arisen in time for the consideration of the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence," suggesting the committee was not aware of it."I am not going to respond, therefore, to the query from News24."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
