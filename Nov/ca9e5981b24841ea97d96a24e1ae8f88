The IC decided not to convene when the provincial secretary had to face charges of assault in a court of law."READ MORE: Fransman assistant to sue over ANC membership 'insult'He said he believed the case was politically motivated."The IC was used in a political battle by a faction, something the October 2015 NGC cautioned against. Thus, the IC can condone fraudsters and assaulters as long as they are in the faction of Mantashe."Issue of successionFransman said he wrote to the national disciplinary committee in October indicating the disciplinary committee process was "nothing but a factional intent to get rid of me, and we requested them to intervene and get the relevant documents to me as the [secretary general] promised. Needless to say, I received no such."He questioned why "a certain faction" would go to such great lengths "to get rid of him"."Why would such important comrades cling onto a lie of a person that they don't even know" over the word of "a comrade that served for more than two decades in senior positions, with no wrongful doing in offices, other than the opposition parties accusing him of whatever?"Fransman said he believes the reason the party has "gone for him" is because he raised certain issues during an NEC meeting in 2015 "where I exposed the Pigalle's restaurant meeting of August 2015 where business and comrades met and decided that Fransman must be taken down as he is an obstacle towards the 2017 conference. And that President Zuma must go at October NGC 2015".Fransman said he also told Mantashe in August 2015 that "the way they're going about the succession issue is wrong and he must go and engage the president and find coherence and unify all of us". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
