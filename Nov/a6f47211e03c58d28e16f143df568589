It was a disgrace that the process was being indefinitely protracted while taxpayers were funding a convicted person&rsquo;s life of luxury.&ldquo;The FF Plus will now put pressure on the Judicial Conduct Tribunal to finalise this matter without delay, and insists that Motata pays back a part of his salary,&rdquo; Mulder said.Motata has been on special leave since January 2007, after he crashed his Jaguar through the boundary wall of a house in Hurlingham, Johannesburg, while drunk. He was found guilty of drunk driving in 2009.&ldquo;No boer is going to undermine me; this used to be the white man&rsquo;s land but it is not anymore,&rdquo; he said at the scene of his crash, it emerged in court.&nbsp;Masutha said proceedings at the Judicial Conduct Tribunal had been postponed until the finalisation of Motata&rsquo;s challenge to the constitutionality of sections of the Judicial Services Commission Act.&ldquo;However Judge Motata&rsquo;s special leave is not subject to a condition that the judge would have to repay the money earned if he is found guilty of gross misconduct by the Judicial Conduct Tribunal,&rdquo; the minister said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
