Can you imagine the country's rapacious police officers checking on that at roadblocks?Cape Town &ndash; The Thabo Mbeki Foundatiuon (TMF) has reportedly said that Zimbabwe is capable of working out solutions that can help bring about economic development ."This country is full of creative, educated people with vast entrepreneurial skills, thus, there is no need to look to the West or anywhere else," the foundation's chief executive officer, Max Moqwana was quoted as saying.According to the state-owned Herald newspaper, Moqwana said this while officiating at the Law Society Summer School in Nyanga last week.Moqwana said that Zimbabweans should take advantage of "such programmes like the bilateral agreements that President [Jacob] Zuma has with President [Robert] Mugabe and explore opportunities to revive their own country".Zuma was in Zimbabwe last week for the inaugural session of the Bi-National Commission (BNC).Established on April 8, 2015, the BNC was set to steer bilateral relations between the two neighbouring countries, while seeking to promote and enhance co-operation in various sectors within the two governments.Mugabe and Zuma co-chaired the commission, which required that the heads of state meet annually to monitor progress on the implementation of agreed projects.&nbsp;Moqwana said that Zimbabwe only needed "credible leaders" who could be trusted for the country to "recover from the current challenges".Zimbabwe has been reeling under harsh economic conditions following the imposition of sanctions against the southern African country more than a decade ago by the Western countries.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
