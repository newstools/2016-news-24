This follows the NPA&rsquo;s decision to charge Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and then later drop the charges. The office of the president said Zuma gave notice of his intention to request reasons as to whether to suspend Abrahams, Director of Public Prosecutions Sibongile Mzinyathi and Acting Special Director of Public Prosecutions Dr Torie Pretorius. &ldquo;The President has requested the three advocates to make written representations to him, as to why they should not be placed on suspension and whether to hold an inquiry into their fitness to hold office.&rdquo; Zuma had also questioned their respective offices, the presidency said. Zuma&rsquo;s decision follows a request by Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation for the President to suspend the three advocates pending an inquiry into their fitness to hold office. Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation raised concerns with the manner in which the three advocates conducted the prosecution of Minister Pravin Gordhan, former deputy SA Revenue Service commissioner Ivan Pillay and former SARS commissioner Oupa Magashula. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
