There were no constitutional issues behind the decision to withdraw from the ICC.While the report did not apportion blame, the allegations it contained had to be verified, Kodwa said.On October 21, Justice Minister Michael Masutha told reporters that South Africa had initiated the process of withdrawing from the ICC by notifying the United Nations of its intention to revoke its ratification of the Rome Statute, which established the court.The decision followed several court judgments that the government violated the law by not arresting Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir during his visit to South Africa in June last year. The ICC wants him to stand trial on charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
