Firefighters were still battling to contain the blaze on the Verano on Friday morning, said spokesperson Tebogo Ramatjie. The 41-year-old factory stern trawler caught fire on Wednesday morning. It bore the Russian flag and was owned by Insung Corporation of South Korea. The city's fire services said on Thursday that some of the 800 000 polystyrene containers on board were still alight. Quite a bit of the internal furniture and fittings were burnt. Smoke could still be seen billowing from the vessel docked at the container basement section of the harbour on Friday afternoon. Samsa's acting regional manager Captain Gustav Louw confirmed that a surveyor was dispatched for a preliminary investigation shortly after the fire broke out. Once they are able to go on board the main focus of their investigation would be to find the cause of the fire. Five crew were evacuated and no injuries were reported. Louw confirmed the crew would be repatriated after being interviewed. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
