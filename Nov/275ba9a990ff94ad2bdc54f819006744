I will never talk to Thabo Mbeki because he is an ANC (member) and the ANC are my enemies.&ldquo;My whole political career was crowned by the fact [that] I was never going to use a lie on the pretext that Mbeki was involved; I was not gonna use a lie to get myself out that Mbeki was involved,&rdquo; Derby-Lewis reportedly said.Limpho Hani on Thursday said she was not aware that there was a documentary about her husband because no one had approached her about it.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the people who are doing the documentary about my husband. They have not talked to ANC, they have not talked to SACP, they have not talked to me.&rdquo;She said despite that fact, what had offended her the most was the fact that the report was using the names of the country&rsquo;s leaders &ldquo;in vain&rdquo;.&ldquo;If you read that story, there is no story, but what has offended me is [that] the name of our former president Thabo Mbeki is mentioned there. The story doesn&rsquo;t make sense.&ldquo;I appeal to the editor of The Star not to sell piece papers by throwing our leaders&rsquo; names in vain. As an editor of a newspaper, how do you come up with a story like that?&ldquo;The paper itself says &lsquo;Derby-Lewis did say comrade Thabo was not involved', but the editor allows that story, where there&rsquo;s insinuations that former president Thabo Mbeki was involved in killing my husband.&rdquo; Hani said if the publication had information about her husband&rsquo;s murder, they should rather take it to the police.&ldquo;The Star editor, [if] you have information about people who killed my husband, don&rsquo;t use the newspaper, go to the police&hellip; You are not going to use the names of our leaders in vain,&rdquo; she said.She said the ruling party was under attack and its members needed to defend it and its leaders.&ldquo;Comrades, the enemy of the ANC is at work, we have to defend our organisation. It doesn&rsquo;t matter where, how, who, we cannot allow our leaders names to be used in vain.&rdquo; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
