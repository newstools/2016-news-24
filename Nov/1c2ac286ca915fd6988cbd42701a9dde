That has caused the disruption of water supplies in some areas.Egypt, a mostly desert country of some 92 million, is almost entirely dependent on the Nile for agriculture and drinking water.Experts warned against drinking tap water. Ahmed el-Shennawi, a water expert, told the Rotana Egypt TV network that "change of the color to yellow is a disaster and we should be cautious until water filtering takes place."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
