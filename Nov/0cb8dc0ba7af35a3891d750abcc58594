Jenni Evans, News24 Cape Town - Sir Lowry's Pass in the Western Cape was closed because of a big veld fire on Tuesday, the province's traffic spokesperson Kenny Africa said. Plumes of smoke billowed near parts of the steep four-lane N2 highway over the Hottentots Holland mountains, reducing visibility. Motorists were asked to use an alternative route via Gordons Bay, Kleinmond, and Botriver.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
