After a bomb concealed in a laptop exploded on a Daallo airlines flight in February, the monitors warned that the Shabaab were resorting to more sophisticated tactics targeting aircraft. They cited indications that the Islamists are "likely to have had external assistance in the construction of the device," but those findings were detailed in a separate strictly confidential annex to the report. Assassinating leaders Allied to Al-Qaeda since 2012, the Shabaab controlled Mogadishu for several years until it was pushed out in 2011. But the extremist group continues to fight to overthrow the Western-backed government.A series of drone strikes and raids that killed at least three senior Shabaab leaders may have failed to have a serious impact on the Islamist group, the UN report said. "Al-Shabaab possesses a robust and ideologically committed 'middle management' capable of seamlessly stepping into positions vacated by assassinated senior leaders," it added.After the council slapped a ban on charcoal exports, a major source of Shabaab funding, the insurgents turned to the illicit sugar trade and "taxation" of agricultural production.The Shabaab derive up to $18 million a year in revenue from checkpoints demanding payment from trucks carrying sugar, according to the report.It cited a Somali intelligence estimate that some $9.5 million go into Shabaab coffers per year from taxing agricultural production. The report criticized the Somali government for failing to pay soldiers' salaries, which led to withdrawals from areas in the south and center of the country that allowed Shabaab forces to return.It cited continued corruption and a likely misappropriation of funds and supplies intended for soldiers, some of which came from outside countries.Attacks on AMISOM have continued, the report said, including a deadly twin truck bombing of a Kenyan military compound in January that left some 150 soldiers dead. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
