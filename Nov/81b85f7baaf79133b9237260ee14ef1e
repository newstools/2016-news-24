I do not think we have been heard at all.&rdquo;McMahon said the new theme paid tribute to the theatrical world of Broadway and the West End.It would honour everyone&rsquo;s favourite musical productions.&ldquo;Whether one chooses new musicals currently showing in New York or London, like Kinky Boots, or classics like Cats, Grease, The Sound of Music, or Oklahoma &ndash; or any Rodgers and Hammerstein creation, there is without a doubt a character from a musical that will appeal to your personality and wet your taste buds at &lsquo;MCQP, The Musical&rsquo;.&rdquo;The event would be held at the ZipZap Circus Dome in the Foreshore.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
