We spoke to Treasury, and Treasury viewed the matter favourably, but it was not finalised."The Red Ants controversially clear illegally occupied buildings and land. Their name is derived from the red overalls they wear when they descend on properties in a convoy of trucks.Mashatile wants the attachment reversed, so that the department and the company can agree to a payment settlement.Comment from the Red Ants was not immediately available.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
