The judge said he was aware that the charges against Dlamini were serious.Dlamini wore a green top and a black and white keffiyeh over his shoulders. His ankles were chained. He greeted fellow student leader Vuyani Pambo and smiled at students who had come to support him.Mokgoatlheng said the magistrate&rsquo;s court ruling that Dlamini would pose a danger to society was wrong.
