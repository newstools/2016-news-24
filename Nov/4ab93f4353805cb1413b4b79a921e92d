Molefe featured extensively in the State of Capture report, which was released following a court order.The report included damning details on the relationship between Molefe and the controversial Gupta family. Molefe and Ajay Gupta, the eldest of three Gupta brothers, made 58 telephone calls to one another between August 2015 and March 2016, according to the report.The organisation said as a matter of principle, State Owned Enterprises were not for self-enrichment and dishing out tenders to friends and &lsquo;business associates&rsquo; but rather about servicing and improving the lives of ordinary people.&ldquo;As the YCLSA, we will continue to fight corruption in society, including in every State Owned Enterprise, because corruption is a cancer that is poised to destroying the hard-earned gains of our democracy,&rdquo; the organisation said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
