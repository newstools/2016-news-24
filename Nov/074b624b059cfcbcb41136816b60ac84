If he did not agree then they can make me an accused.&rdquo;He was not made an accused.Siyoni said Stander and the investigating officer Kanna Swanepoel pleaded with him to not give up being a State witness.After consulting Stander and his lawyer Zolile Ngqeza, they said he must not mention that he was assaulted.Ngqeza was informed that they would not be able to use his client if he stuck to his claims that he was assaulted and told to say certain things.&ldquo;I was therefore surprised to be called to court on Monday.&rdquo;He alleged that Swanepoel mentioned tree poison.&ldquo;If this thing came out then they would poison me,&rdquo; Siyoni said.A common legal metaphor is that of the fruit of the poisonous tree, which is used to describe evidence obtained illegally. If the source (the tree) of the evidence is tainted, then anything gained from that (the fruit) is also tainted. Such evidence is not normally admissible in court.&ldquo;Everything that happened between myself, Mr Kanna and Mr Stander, including the people who tortured me, Mr Stander knows,&rdquo; said Siyoni.&ldquo;I am surprised that he is asking questions about things as if he is not aware of the content because he knows the truth. This is not the truth.&rdquo;Siyoni, a body builder, worked as a bouncer for Panayiotou at his Infinity nightclub in Port Elizabeth. He allegedly acted as a middleman, hiring Sizwezakhe Vumazonke to murder Jayde.Panayiotou, Sinethemba Nenembe and Zolani Sibeko are on trial on charges of conspiring, and kidnapping, robbing and murdering Jayde on April 21 2015. They pleaded not guilty.Vumazonke died in hospital in September.Panayiotou&rsquo;s lawyer Terry Price said it needed to be established if Stander knew beforehand that Siyoni would deviate from his statements.&ldquo;I find it highly doubtful,&rdquo; said Judge Dayalin Chetty.Court was adjourned until Wednesday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
