No patterned cornrows were allowed. Longer braids had to be tied back. No decorations or beads were allowed in the hair.&ldquo;No dyeing, bleaching, highlighting, colouring, colour washing, colour rinsing, or shaving of hair in any way is allowed.&ldquo;Singles/braids must be the same length and be the natural colour of the girl&rsquo;s hair. Longer braids must be tied back,&rdquo; the code read.Nowhere did the code specifically forbid an afro hairstyle.In addition, the girls claimed they were not allowed to speak in their mother tongue and that a teacher called them monkeys when they were singing and chanting in class.Lesufi said at the time that the school governing body would thrash out a new code of conduct, in consultation with pupils, and that there would be &ldquo;a cessation of hostilities&rdquo;.He said it was important for the issues to be discussed.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
