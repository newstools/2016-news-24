Terry Price, for the defence, has continued to cross-examine, repeatedly grill and call into question the methods and procedures of Lt. Col. Mayi, the arresting officer of alleged middleman and state witness Luthando Siyoni. Jump to bottom TP: And if we look, this is your signature under interpreter, is that his signature on the left?&nbsp;WM: Yes&nbsp;TP: OK, we are going to show you a number of signatures, are they all his?&nbsp;WM: Yes&nbsp;TP: Did you see him sign with your own eyes?&nbsp;WM: Yes&nbsp;TP: No further questions&nbsp;Chetty: Mr Daubermann&nbsp;PD: No questions&nbsp;MS: If we can have a short adjournment, I just have one or two aspects I need to clarify quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;- SHORT ADJOURNMENT -&nbsp;MS: I have no re-examination for the witness, my lord&nbsp;MS: I now want to ask for a lunch adjournment&nbsp;MS: Two of my police officials were involved with an accident with a kudu&nbsp;MS: I am trying to get other witnesses and should have at least one witness available after the lunch break&nbsp;Chetty: Any objections?&nbsp;TP: None, my lord&nbsp;Chetty: We will stand down until 14:15. Court is adjourned.&nbsp;TP: She saw him, that he had a swollen eye, a split lip, his knees were dirty and his pants were torn&nbsp;TP: Is it your evidence that she didn't see it, because it wasn't there?&nbsp;WM: It is not true what she is saying, but she did see him there&nbsp;TP: So she is lying about that?&nbsp;WM: Yes, she is lying&nbsp;TP: Approximately 25 minutes later, Mr Greef noted the swollen eye, so she couldn't be that wrong&nbsp;MS: I checked my record, I don't find it in my evidence that Babalwa Breakfast says that the knees was dirty&nbsp;TP: It is an error on our part&nbsp;TP: The split lip, torn pants and eye are still there&nbsp;TP: This is a statement taken from Sizwe Vumazonke, taken by Captain Swanepoel, with you in attendance&nbsp;TP: Do you recall it?&nbsp;WM: Yes, I recall it&nbsp;TP: This is the same Vumazonke that you said didn't need an interpreter, but here he is using one, and it's you&nbsp;WM: Yes&nbsp;TP: If we read here: "The police injured me." You should remember that&nbsp;TP: Is that the first time you remember him making the allegation that he was assaulted?&nbsp;WM: Yes&nbsp;TP: When we go to the SAP22 - prisoner's property - the entry is nil. They found no property on him, no money, no cellphone.&nbsp;WM: The person who can make a clear explanation is the person who took down the SAP22&nbsp;TP: You know what a SAP22 is, don't you?&nbsp;WM: I was going to explain&nbsp;WM: When you detain a person, you cannot book a person's personal belongings into the SAP22 while the relatives are present, because the personal belongings are normally handed over to the relative.&nbsp;TP: What relative was there?&nbsp;WM: Babalwa&nbsp;TP: She's his girlfriend, not a relative&nbsp;WM: OK, his girlfriend&nbsp;TP: My question was, that do you agree Babalwa saw Siyoni at Kabega Park during the early hours of April 28?&nbsp;WM: That is what I am disputing, that it is the only time...&nbsp;TP: I am not saying it is the only time, forget the other time, all I am saying is that she saw him&nbsp;WM: Yes, she saw him&nbsp;TP: She was implicating herself in the crime&nbsp;WM: No I don't think so, she merely was keeping Siyoni's money for safekeeping&nbsp;TP: But we have been over this, [in] her statement she says that the money was given by Chris to pay for the murder of [his] wife, that makes her an accomplice.&nbsp;WM: That never occurred to me, it just appeared that she was being truthful&nbsp;TP: Your claim that, when you went into Infinity, you say the first person you spoke to was Siyoni, it wasn't, it was Pumlani&nbsp;WM: No, it was Siyoni&nbsp;TP: We will show the CCTV footage that shows that it was not&nbsp;TP: You say he went back in to collect his wages, totalling about R380&nbsp;TP: Did you take anything off him?&nbsp;WM: No one took anything from him&nbsp;WM: When he was arrested, maybe he gave his girlfriend his stuff&nbsp;TP: Are you guessing, did you see it?&nbsp;WM: No, I didn't see anything.&nbsp;TP: Only because he never knew that he did not have to let you in&nbsp;TP: Who did the house belong to, him or his mother?&nbsp;WM: The shack behind the house belonged to Siyoni&nbsp;TP: He said so?&nbsp;WM: Yes&nbsp;TP: And now, horror of horrors, the money is not in the wardrobe&nbsp;TP: Were you not surprised that the money was not there?&nbsp;WM: I was not surprised at all. That comes back to the reason why we went to the house without a search warrant&nbsp;TP: And you had to go through another two properties if I'm not mistaken&nbsp;WM: That is not so. When we emerged from the house, we went to the vehicle. Siyoni spoke to Babalwa, and she said she had forgot to tell him she removed it from the house and gave it to a relative for safekeeping.&nbsp;TP: And you went to that house, and you entered that house and the money was found?&nbsp;WM: We were at the gate of the house, Babalwa called out to the lady and she brought the money.&nbsp;TP: And did you tell Babalwa she did not have to point out the money to you?&nbsp;WM: Babalwa is the one who gave the information in her statement about the money and it was the boyfriend who had willingly told us that we can go and fetch the money. I saw no reason to warn them.&nbsp;TP: Did you have a search warrant?&nbsp;WM: I did not have a search warrant&nbsp;TP: You have to have a search warrant&nbsp;WM: You don't always have to conduct a search without a search warrant&nbsp;TP: Tell us when you don't need to do a search without a search warrant&nbsp;WM: It is under the circumstances, when the circumstances are of such a nature that what you are looking for, may have been removed.&nbsp;TP: Who else would have known about that money, the two people who knew about it were [with you]&nbsp;WM: We were not aware that the two of them were the only people who knew about the money&nbsp;TP: Were you given the indication that anyone else was involved?&nbsp;WM: That is correct. When we got the money, it was not found at his place, it was found elsewhere.&nbsp;TP: You jumping the gun, when you left KwaNobuhle, did you know if anyone else had knowledge of the money?&nbsp;WM: We did not know about the money, Thando told us his money was at home in a wardrobe, and we believed that his mother could access the money.&nbsp;TP: Where did you get that?&nbsp;WM: He was living at home, she could go into the room&nbsp;TP: Did you get permission from Siyoni to search the house?&nbsp;WM: It was not a search&nbsp;WM: The fact that we were there with Siyoni in his house proves he had given us permission&nbsp;WM: I did explain the rights to this young man. After I explained his rights, he said he understands, he said he's feeling free, and that he is prepared to show the money that is at his house.&nbsp;TP: Are you now saying he volunteered to show you the money?&nbsp;WM: Yes, the girlfriend had already made mention of the money&nbsp;TP: Yes, so you knew about the money, before you even took him to the house?&nbsp;WM: Yes&nbsp;TP: So you must have told him you knew about the money, because Babalwa had already told him&nbsp;WM: I did not have to tell him about the money, I told him his girlfriend had given me a full account of what happened&nbsp;TP: So out of the blue, he just said I will take you to the money&nbsp;WM: I don't know what prompted him&nbsp;WM: Maybe he was aware his girlfriend knew about the money&nbsp;TP: But that is exactly what Siyoni said happened, you pulled his pants down and had a look&nbsp;WM: That never happened&nbsp;TP: Police are issued pepper spray&nbsp;WM: Visible policing&nbsp;TP: Come now, anyone who wants can sign for it&nbsp;WM: I only know of visible policing. No one in my team that I am aware of have pepper spray.&nbsp;TP: Is it correct that you went to his house to search for the money?&nbsp;WM: We never conducted a search, he was going to do the pointing out of the money.&nbsp;TP: Are you aware you should warn a person of his rights before a pointing out?&nbsp;WM: Yes, that is so in respect to a formal pointing out&nbsp;WM: Here, I had already placed the person under arrest and the money he was pointing out was not a formal pointing out&nbsp;TP: Why do you say that?&nbsp;WM: Here is an arrested person making mention of money remaining in the house. Now for example, anyone can just enter into the room and remove the money.&nbsp;WM: This could happen while we are still busy trying to set up a formal pointing out.&nbsp;TP: He was going to point out the money, you should have warned him&nbsp;TP: That never happenedTP: Surely you could write down what he told you, you have got your diary there&nbsp;WM: The reason why I didn't get into details was because it would give the impression that he would be forced or compelled&nbsp;TP: Apart from that answer making no sense at all, you cannot show this court any written document that shows what he said to you&nbsp;WM: That is correct, that is why I didn't want to take details. That information should have been taken by the investigating officer.&nbsp;TP: You didn't take any note of any confessions he made, without any indication he would say anything to anyone else?&nbsp;WM: I am not entitled to effect an arrest on a person and then obtain a confession from him&nbsp;TP: That is not correct, it is not law that you can't do it&nbsp;TP: I am not going to argue the law with you&nbsp;TP: What I want to put to you is that if Mr Siyoni said nothing further, you would have nothing against him.&nbsp;WM: I had a statement and it was confirmed by the money.&nbsp;TP: You are jumping ahead, I'm talking about at Kwanobuhle. You only had Babalwa's statement and nothing else.&nbsp;WM: Yes that is correct, I had the statement&nbsp;TP: Now, when you gave the document to Babalwa to read, can you show us how she read it?&nbsp;WM: [sits] "Babalwa was sitting down" [he holds up the paper at some distance from him]&nbsp;TP: Is it like this?&nbsp;WM: Yes&nbsp;TP: What if I told you that she is legally blind?&nbsp;MS: Is he referring to now, or at the time?&nbsp;TP: The document we have put before this court is that it's been like that since age 7&nbsp;TP: The reason you don't know is because she didn't read it&nbsp;WM: No, she read it&nbsp;[TP talks about the suspect who had soiled his pants]&nbsp;TP: Did you have a look?&nbsp;WM: No&nbsp;TP: How did you know?&nbsp;WM: I saw a wetness&nbsp;TP: But why did it take so long?&nbsp;WM: I told her what information I had, and then she told me what information she had. This doesn't happen over a short period.&nbsp;TP: So once you got her statement, you went to the other office and placed him under arrest?&nbsp;WM: Yes&nbsp;TP: And if you are consistent, you warned him and he didn't make any requests?&nbsp;WM: I did say that after I informed him yesterday, I explained his rights and the reasons for his arrest, he even showed his co-operation and said let's go to the house and get the R30 000.&nbsp;TP: So he opened up spontaneously?&nbsp;WM: That is correct&nbsp;TP: Did he waive his rights to an attorney?&nbsp;WM: That is correct, he never asked for an attorney&nbsp;TP: And he specifically told you that?&nbsp;WM: That is correct, that is why we went to the place he said we must go to&nbsp;TP: What he told you, the way he implicated himself, did you write it down?&nbsp;WM: I never wrote it down, because we did not go into the details&nbsp;TP: And do you know where he would have got something like this?&nbsp;WM: Everyone is aware that I placed Mr Siyoni under arrest at Uitenhage after I picked him up at Infinity&nbsp;TP: Mr Swanepoel goes on, "Mr Siyoni, after leaving the building, was handcuffed and placed in a vehicle"&nbsp;WM: He was not handcuffed&nbsp;TP: Let's go on. How long did you speak to Babalwa Breakfast? You said it was about an hour and a half&nbsp;WM: Yes, it was about an hour and a half that I listened to her statement&nbsp;TP: How long did you sit with her before you went to arrest Siyoni?&nbsp;WM: It was from the time we arrived just after 9pm, up to just after 23:40&nbsp;TP: So you must have been in her company alone for two hours plus&nbsp;WM: Yes, that is correct&nbsp;TP: And this is a person who spontaneously opened up to you and told you everything?&nbsp;WM: Yes&nbsp;TP: Let me tell you Mr Stander is a very senior prosecutor, and he will never assume anything, the only way he would have said that is if someone had told him&nbsp;TP: I am now going to refer you to a statement from Captain Swanepoel&nbsp;TP: This is a statement he filed opposing the bail application of Mr Panayiotou this year&nbsp;TP: I will make this available to the court&nbsp;TP: Mr Swanepoel has a habit of not marking his pages, but I read from page 16.&nbsp;TP: [reads] "Siyoni was arrested at the Infinity Lounge, where he was informed of his rights"&nbsp;TP: According to you, that is not right&nbsp;WM: That is incorrect, I did not arrest him there&nbsp;TP: And Swanepoel was not there&nbsp;WM: That is correct&nbsp;TP: Colonel Mayi, you say you never handcuffed Mr Siyoni at Infinity&nbsp;WM: I never handcuffed him there&nbsp;TP: And you never placed him under arrest&nbsp;TP: I want to read to you from page 480 of the bail application&nbsp;Chetty: Is this part of the bail proceedings?&nbsp;TP: Yes&nbsp;Chetty: That hasn't been handed in&nbsp;TP: It will be, but Mr Stander does have a copy so we won't be misleading the court&nbsp;TP: [reads] "Beeton: Where was he arrested. Stander at the shop"&nbsp;TP: So that is incorrect?&nbsp;WM: He was taken from the shop, he was not arrested&nbsp; TP: Do you agree that Mr Siyoni was not arrested?&nbsp;WM: That is correct, but someone may have assumed that when he was taken from the shop, he was arrested.&nbsp;TP: An hour after that, WO Greef and Reynolds describe his eye as red and swollen when they took him to Fort Beaufort&nbsp;TP: How did it get from a tiny scratch to that?&nbsp;WM: What happened, that eye sustained a minor scratch. When I left him it was not swollen. It could have swollen afterwards.&nbsp;TP: You have got to be joking colonel.&nbsp;WM: I am not joking and there is no reason for me to deny that he had a scratch&nbsp;TP: There is every reason, it is because you and your team beat him up, and that is why you are minimising the nature of his injuries&nbsp;WM: No one ever assaulted Siyoni&nbsp;TP: Do you know that Captain Swanepoel took a statement from him, and he says he had a red left eye&nbsp;WM: I don't deny that... if you hit me for example, my eye doesn't turn red immediately, it develops&nbsp;TP: You have turned a whale into a tadpole&nbsp;TP: I am about to move on to a new area, I shouldn't be more than another hour, but perhaps we can take the adjournment&nbsp;Chetty: Court is adjournedWM: I was going to place the handcuffs on him in the front&nbsp;WM: When I placed the handcuffs on him, he got up from the chair&nbsp;TP: Was any of the handcuff on him already?&nbsp;WM: One side&nbsp;TP: So his hands weren't together yet?&nbsp;WM: That is correct, we were trying to tie his hands together&nbsp;WM: He threw his hands up, and I told him I was bound to put handcuffs on him because I was taking him to the township&nbsp;WM: He resisted and I requested the help of my young men to help&nbsp;WM: We grabbed him and placed the handcuffs on him&nbsp;TP: How many of your young men, as you call them, assisted you?&nbsp;WM: We were five altogether, but not all of us&nbsp;TP: OK, where does the injury come from, sorry, the tiny little scratch?&nbsp;WM: I did indicate. He was sitting down, and when we put the handcuff on him, he got up and threw up his hands...&nbsp;TP: So was it the handcuff that caused the cut?&nbsp;WM: I don't want to commit to say it was the handcuff&nbsp;TP: Did you notice the scratch immediately?&nbsp;WM: No&nbsp;TP: Can you describe the scratch, perhaps you can show us on the ruler&nbsp;TP: I am not going to give it a measurement, I am just asking you to give us an idea&nbsp;TP: Was it visible? WM: Not very&nbsp;TP: The following day, on the 28th?&nbsp;WM: Yes&nbsp;TP: Which way did you drive?&nbsp;WM: Fort Beaufort&nbsp;TP: So at some point in time you were in Fort Beaufort?&nbsp;WM: Yes that is correct, we had to go through Fort Beaufort to get to Alice&nbsp;TP: The small injury you say Siyoni sustained, can you explain how that happened?&nbsp;WM: It was after I had explained to him and the statement I had from Babalwa.&nbsp;WM: I now explained his rights to him and explained he was now under arrest&nbsp;TP: [One] second, before now he had given his full co-operation&nbsp;TP: He had done everything you had asked him to do that far?&nbsp;WM: It was not a very long time, it was a very short time&nbsp;TP: What I am saying is that before you handcuffed him, you had no reason to believe he would resist&nbsp;WM: That is correct&nbsp;TP: Tell us how you handcuffed him, and how he resisted&nbsp;TP: Let's go to Kwanobuhle&nbsp;TP: Siyoni says he wasn't handcuffed during the trip, but immediately after he got out the car he was handcuffed&nbsp;WM: That is not true, that didn't happen&nbsp;TP: Now, besides the five of you, Babalwa Breakfast and Luthando Siyoni, was there anyone else at the station?&nbsp;WM: Two security officers were there, keeping guard of the building&nbsp;TP: You arrived in pitch darkness&nbsp;WM: Yes&nbsp;TP: So aside from the guards, was there anyone else?&nbsp;WM: No&nbsp;TP: So if we forget the guards, then it was just the 7 of you?&nbsp;WM: Yes&nbsp;TP: Is it an out of the way police station&nbsp;WM: No&nbsp;TP: It is in the township&nbsp;WM: Yes&nbsp;TP: You said you came from Alice and after the arrest you returned&nbsp;WM: Yes&nbsp;TP: You are a colonel in the police and you don't know&nbsp;WM: I know about the judge's rules in the pocket book, but that is an old thing, that is why we have the SAP14a&nbsp;TP: I am not talking judge's rules or SAP14&nbsp;TP: I am talking standing orders&nbsp;[TP reads from standing orders]&nbsp;TP: Do you see that, you saying you didn't know that?&nbsp;WM: I didn't say that I didn't know. What I am saying is that I can't remember if I got him to sign in the pocket book&nbsp;TP: Let me put it to you that according to this order, you would have HAD to ask him to sign and if he didn't sign, you would have had to get someone else to sign.&nbsp;WM: Yes, but this does not refer to the SAP14a&nbsp;TP: That's because this has nothing to do with the SAP14a. It is supposed to happen immediately when you warn the person&nbsp;TP: The simple question is, did you know this is compulsory or not?&nbsp;WM: Yes I did&nbsp;TP: But you don't know if it happened here&nbsp;WM: What I said is I don't want to commit myself to say that he signed, but I did write down indicating that I did explain his rights to him.&nbsp;TP: The diary that is now missing&nbsp;WM: Unfortunately&nbsp;TP: Fortunately for you&nbsp;TP: Did he sign your diary?&nbsp;WM: I can't recall if I made him sign&nbsp;TP: Do you know that there are standing orders that you are compelled to put it in your pocket book or diary and to give the suspect the opportunity to sign?&nbsp;WM: That is why I say I can't recall if he signed&nbsp;TP: Are you aware that it is compulsory to do so?&nbsp;WM: That is not compulsory, that is why there is the provision of the SAP14a&nbsp;TP: Are you saying it is not compulsory?&nbsp;WM: Sometimes it does happen, but that is why the SAP14a is provided&nbsp;TP: Do you understand my English?&nbsp;TP: You do not need the interpreter&nbsp;TP: I am going to ask you, are you not aware that it [is] compulsory for you to make a note in your pocket book, and to let the suspect sign, if not to get a fellow officer to sign and if not then to get a member of the public to sign&nbsp;WM: I don't know&nbsp;TP: Did you read it from here, or did you give it from memory?&nbsp;WM: From memory TP: Did you give all 10?&nbsp;WM: Maybe not all, but I explained the basic rights&nbsp;TP: Do you have any written proof of this?&nbsp;WM: No&nbsp;TP: So we must rely on your word?&nbsp;WM: When you effect an arrest on the person, you warn them verbally, and when you get to the charge office, that is when you give them the written version&nbsp;TP: Answer my question, you are not listening. Did you put anything in writing proving that you had warned Mr Siyoni?&nbsp;WM: I have already said, I didn't&nbsp;TP: So we come back to the question I asked three questions ago, we have to rely on your word&nbsp;TP: Because Mr Siyoni told this court you never gave him any warning&nbsp;WM: I did give him his rights, verbally at Kwanobuhle, and when we detained him I gave him his written rights&nbsp;TP: And you put this in your diary&nbsp;WM: Yes&nbsp;TP: I want to take you to another document, it is very similar, except that this relates to Siyoni&nbsp;TP: That is your signature and I am sure you will say it is Siyoni's on the left&nbsp;WM: Yes, that is correct&nbsp;TP: When did you fill this in?&nbsp;WM: I filled it in at the charge office&nbsp;TP: What time?&nbsp;WM: The time will be in the occurrence book&nbsp;TP: But there is no time filled in here&nbsp;TP: I want to take you to paragraph 3b. Did you warn him that he does not have to make a confession?&nbsp;WM: Yes I did warn him that he was not compelled to make a confession&nbsp;TP: Did he react in any way?&nbsp;WM: No&nbsp;TP: Is this the only SAP14a that you filled in for Siyoni, from the time you took him from Infinity?&nbsp;WM: Yes, it is&nbsp;TP: But you claim you warned him in Kwanobuhle, after you took the statement from Babalwa&nbsp;WM: Yes&nbsp;TP: Same rights as you have here?&nbsp;WM: Yes&nbsp;TP: What did Sizwe say when you told him he had the right to an attorney?&nbsp;WM: I want the court to understand, I was not consulting with the suspect. I was merely reading him his rights.&nbsp;TP: I can't believe I am hearing this from a colonel in the police. Are you saying he never responded to you, he never made any choices?&nbsp;WM: When you read these rights, you must read these rights to the full. There is nothing that requires the suspect to make a choice when you read it to him.&nbsp;TP: You obviously have no idea how the law works. Let me put it to you this way: What would you have done if Vumazonke had asked you for a lawyer?&nbsp;WM: I would have been compelled to make arrangements with the charge office to make a phone available so that he can call his legal representation, and an entry would have been made in the occurrence book to say who he had called.&nbsp;TP: So you are saying he never gave you any answers?&nbsp;WM: There was only one answer he had to give me, and that was whether he understood his rights as [I] explained it to him.&nbsp;TP: So in your version, he never said he wants a lawyer or doesn't want one?&nbsp;WM: He said he understands his rights and he will see what he will do&nbsp;TP: You don't answer my questions. Did he say I want or I don't want a lawyer?&nbsp;WM: I didn't ask him if he wanted or needed the services of a legal representative. I merely explained his rights.&nbsp;TP: So you translated all these rights into Xhosa?&nbsp;WM: Yes I read his rights out in Xhosa, and he said I don't have to repeat it in English as he is aware of his rights&nbsp;TP: I am going to ask you to translate Section 2a in Xhosa for this court, and the court interpreter to reinterpret it back to us&nbsp;[WM reads clause about the rights to an attorney]&nbsp;TP: Did you make him aware that he had the right to immediate representation?&nbsp;WM: That is correct, I did explain to him that if he had an attorney he can call him and he can come represent him&nbsp;TP: Where did you write this down, this warning?&nbsp;WM: I just explained what is written here, I don't have to write this down&nbsp;TP: But why didn't you write it down?&nbsp;WM: It is already written down here, and as it is written, I will provide him with the original&nbsp;TP: How can this court be certain that you told him he can call his attorney immediately? It is not written anywhere in any of your statements.&nbsp;WM: What happens, when the person is detained, and he wishes to contact someone to be his legal representative, then a phone will be made available to him.&nbsp;TP: Did you offer him medical assistance?&nbsp;WM: He would have been offered medical assistance where he was being detained. I do not have medicine on me.&nbsp;TP: I am not asking you if you had medicine, I am asking you if you could take him to the doctor&nbsp;WM: I would not have been able to take him to the doctor, as I have said I did not have a state vehicle, besides it was not my duty to offer him medical assistance.&nbsp;TP: Why did you not say to the police at Dispatch that the man needs medical treatment?&nbsp;WM: The obligation lies with the charge office to take a person to get medical treatment should he require medical treatment.&nbsp;TP: Did you advise him that he has the right to medical treatment?&nbsp;WM: Yes, it is part of the warnings that are given&nbsp;TP: And what language did you warn him in?&nbsp;WM: Xhosa&nbsp;TP: This is the notice of the rights you read to Vumazonke on the 3rd of May 2015 at 6am&nbsp;WM: That is correct&nbsp;TP: Is that Vumazonke, bottom left corner?&nbsp;WM: Yes, he signed there&nbsp;TP: When you allegedly gave this warning to him, was he injured?&nbsp;TP: Injuries that you could see&nbsp;WM: Yes, I did observe something&nbsp;TP: Tell us&nbsp;WM: I can't recall if it was his left or right eye that was swollen&nbsp;TP: Swollen shut?&nbsp;WM: At the time we met, it was not swollen shut&nbsp;TP: But it wasn't a small little cut?&nbsp;WM: I can't say the size of the cut&nbsp;TP: Did you ask him what happened to him?&nbsp;WM: No&nbsp;TP: Why not?&nbsp;WM: I was not investigating the case&nbsp;TP: You are a police officer, you are supposed to look after accused people, why did you not ask?&nbsp;WM: What I know, for him to be registered in the occurrence book, you need to state how he sustained an injury&nbsp;TP: Are you saying you asked him that?&nbsp;WM: What I am saying, when he was detained, it was obvious he would have been asked how he sustained the injury.TP: I want to get to your statement&nbsp;[TP calls up the document]&nbsp;TP: [reads] "During this time I received a call from a source who wanted to speak to me about the people involved..."&nbsp;WM: Yes&nbsp;TP: "I then drove to Port Elizabeth where I got the name Thando Siyoni..."&nbsp;TP: What do you have to say to that?&nbsp;WM: What I said, when I wrote this statement, I did not find it necessary to dwell on the source and detail.WM: What is evident, I would not have left from Alice to come to PE, if it was not something substantial.&nbsp;TP: Your comment is directly contradicted by your statement in paragraphs 2 and 3&nbsp;WM: I wrote the statement after everything. I did not write it on the way from Alice.&nbsp;TP: But the statement says clearly you only got the name Thando Siyoni when you got to PE&nbsp;WM: I have said when I left Alice, I was already provided with names and information. I still had to come and verify that information. I had just heard the name, I still needed to verify it.&nbsp;TP: I am going to move on from this, but I will argue that you have sidestepped this question because you cannot answer it.&nbsp;WM: I have no reason to sidestep this question&nbsp;TP: What did the source tell you in that telephone call?&nbsp;WM: The source said to me that he wanted to see me because he had information relating to the planning and killing of this case.&nbsp;TP: Was a name given?&nbsp;WM: The source referred to a teacher from Uitenhage&nbsp;TP: That is not a name, did they give you a name?&nbsp;WM: If my memory serves, the person did say it relates to Jayde&nbsp;TP: Is that all the source told you on the phone?&nbsp;WM: The source also told me briefly whom I needed to meet with&nbsp;TP: And whom did they say you must meet with?&nbsp;WM: Now the source told me that the person who was working for Christopher, named Thando Siyoni&nbsp;TP: So before you even came back to PE, you knew that the suspect was Chris and Thando Siyoni?&nbsp;WM: No I want [you] to understand. According to the source, the person [who] would provide me with full information was Thando. Thando who was employed by Chris&nbsp;TP: You are not answering. Please listen. Before leaving Alice for PE, did you already have the names Chris and Thando?&nbsp;WM: I had both names&nbsp;TP: You are not listening, did you ever say you don't trust the source and want to speak to them yourself?&nbsp;WM: I did say that I did not know the person, and I did not know what the nature of the information was, as such I had to go and meet the person myself and determine what the information was&nbsp;TP: Did you say, in your statement, that the person was someone who you had never met before?&nbsp;WM: I never said that, as I did not see the relevance of the information&nbsp;TP: So it is the first time you have mentioned to anyone, and correct me if I'm wrong, that this person wanted to speak to you and only you, was yesterday?&nbsp;WM: That is correct. It came out from a question put to me.&nbsp;WM: There was no reason to put it in the statement.&nbsp;TP: The reason you are avoiding the question is because you are trying to avoid why you did not contact Koen like you should have done.&nbsp;WM: I have been working with sources for quite a long time. My sources are not a person I can make available to anyone.
