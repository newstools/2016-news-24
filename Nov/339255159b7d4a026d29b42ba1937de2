We are not communicating on that. Remember Freedom Under Law wrote to the Presidency. The court papers have our position articulated there. We do not discuss issues that are pending in court,&rdquo; NPA spokesperson Luvuyo Mfuko said on Tuesday. Earlier in the day Zuma requested written representations from Abrahams, Director of Public Prosecutions Sibongile Mzinyathi and Acting Special Director of Public Prosecutions Dr Torie Pretorius.The Presidency said, "The President has requested the three advocates to make written representations to him, as to why they should not be placed on suspension and whether to hold an inquiry into their fitness to hold office."Zuma has questioned their respective offices and whether he should hold an inquiry into their fitness to hold their positions. Zuma&rsquo;s decision follows a request by Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation for the President to suspend the three advocates pending an inquiry into their fitness to hold office.Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation raised concerns with the manner in which the three advocates conducted the prosecution of Minister Pravin Gordhan, former deputy SA Revenue Service commissioner Ivan Pillay and former SARS commissioner Oupa Magashula.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
