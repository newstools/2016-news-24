Civil society organisations had threatened to take Parliament to court if a decision to withhold the CVs of the candidates vying for the post of inspector general of intelligence is not reviewed.&nbsp;Right2Know spokesperson Murray Hunter said that they received a letter from the chair of the portfolio committee on Thursday evening that the CV's would be published online."Essentially they backtracked...this is the first time something like this has been done," he said.In an earlier joint statement, 10 civil society organisations said the decision to withhold the CVs was a step backwards. They gave the committee until Thursday to change its mind, or they would take legal action. &ldquo;This is not right. The recent public protector appointment process showed how important it is for candidates&rsquo; CVs to be public and open to scrutiny. Several of the candidates in that process were members of the intelligence structures, and their CVs were published without any harm,&rdquo;&nbsp;they said.&ldquo;The recent nomination of candidates for the South African Human Rights Commission also met this basic level of transparency.&rdquo;Intelligence committee chairperson Charles Nqakula told the Legal Resources Centre in a letter that while the shortlisting process and interviews would be held in open sessions, the CVs were a different matter.&ldquo;The CVs will be placed before the committee in accordance with Rule 17 (3) of Joint Rules [which] provides that documents before the committee are not open to the public.&ldquo;Curriculum&nbsp;vitaes are of such a nature that their confidential treatment, especially in this process, is reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
