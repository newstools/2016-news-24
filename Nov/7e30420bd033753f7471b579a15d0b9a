She told News24 on Wednesday she &ldquo;fully embraced&rdquo; the remedial action former public protector Thuli Madonsela set out in her report.Madonsela recommended that President Jacob Zuma establish a judicial commission of inquiry to look into the allegations contained in her report. &nbsp;&ldquo;My worry is that the NPA is so politicised and there is so much political meddling. The President just interferes with them. This has been demonstrated by their handling of the Gordhan and McBride matters,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;All this will come to nought if Shaun Abrahams remains in that office. If anyone disturbs the political agenda they refuse to follow up. The NPA is a joke.&rdquo;Mentor has been outspoken about the Gupta family&rsquo;s alleged influence. The former public enterprises committee chairwoman said on Facebook in March that the Guptas offered her the job of public enterprises minister when Barbara Hogan was sacked in 2010. This happened at the Guptas&rsquo; home in Saxonwold, Johannesburg, while President Jacob Zuma was in the house. In return they wanted her to drop SAA&rsquo;s route to India and give it to them.She provided statements to Madonsela during the probe into state capture. &nbsp;Madonsela's remedial action included bringing to the notice of the National Prosecuting Authority and the Hawks &ldquo;those matters identified in this report where it appears crimes have been committed&rdquo;.Mentor said her faith rested in the judiciary.15 years&ldquo;Our judiciary is the last bastion for our democracy. But we must be careful. They will play games with the inquiry just like they do with the court processes. If we are not careful it will take 15 years,&rdquo; Mentor said. &nbsp;&ldquo;President Zuma inherited strong institutions which were established by Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki and because he knows they will hold him to account, he started weakening them one by one.&rdquo;Mentor has repeatedly called Zuma out on social media platforms.Last month, Mentor wrote on Facebook: "Dear Zuma, I spoke to the PP. I revealed things about you and about your folly relationship with the Gupta's through your son."I can go one-on-one with you on a publicly-televised hearing only after the PP releases her report, with or without you having responded to the questions she posed to you six months ago," Mentor added."I am not scared of you, of your lies, your tricks, your delaying tactics, your attempted intimidation, your harassment, and what you normally do to people.&rdquo;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/download-the-full-state-of-capture-pdf-20161102&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
