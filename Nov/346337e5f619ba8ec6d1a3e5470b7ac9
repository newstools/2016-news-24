We want to know how this is&nbsp;going to do (this) for young poor people."'Will only benefit big monopoly capital'Ntuli also questioned the Commonwealth Games infrastructure."Even if the infrastructure is built, it might be too expensive for us to utilise it. So now we don&rsquo;t see the point of taking too much money and investing it in things that must be taking too much money that could be used for job opportunities."ANCYL regional secretary Thinta Cibane said the league rejected the Games as "nothing but a ploy to make big business richer at the expense of small business"."The capital injection into the economy required for these Games will only benefit big monopoly capital."He added that the FIFA World Cup had shown that the "financial model" for big sporting events did not benefit people on the ground.In September last year, Durban was confirmed as the host of the 2022 Commonwealth Games.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
