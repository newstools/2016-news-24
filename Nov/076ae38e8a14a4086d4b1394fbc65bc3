Amaan Rampath, a Grade 11 pupil, is optimistic that he will score high in India . A maths foundation had all my records that I achieved over the past years. This year they came to look for me at the school. They first asked our principal if I would be interested in participating and he allowed me to take part in the Olympiad. This is a dream come true for me and my wish is to get support from my fellow pupils and people of Verulam, he said.Deputy principal Siva Govender said: On behalf of the school governing body, pupils and staff we are really proud of his achievement. We therefore make an appeal to the community to help him realise his dream. He is a driven and motivated man. He wants to use this opportunity as a stepping stone to get bursaries when he finishes Grade 12, he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
