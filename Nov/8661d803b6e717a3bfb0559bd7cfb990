You joined the movement voluntarily. You don&rsquo;t have special membership,&rdquo; he said.Maine said it was &ldquo;not our problem that we weren&rsquo;t there in 1960 when MK [Umkhonto weSizwe] was formed. Maybe we would have made a better contribution.&rdquo;The latest attempt to shield Zuma comes on the heels of a decision by the ANC&rsquo;s KwaZulu-Natal leadership to launch a mass action campaign supporting him and &ldquo;the national democratic revolution&rdquo;.Saying that Madonsela should &ldquo;rest in peace&rdquo;, Maine told delegates that they should defend Zuma, not because &ldquo;I like him&rdquo; but because &ldquo;he is the president of the ANC&rdquo;.Maine tore into Madonsela, saying he had been &ldquo;reliably told that she is joining the DA&rdquo; . He challenged why the ANC government should fund a commission of inquiry for her when it would be aimed at &ldquo;bringing the ANC down&rdquo;.Gumede also rallied to Zuma&rsquo;s defence, saying the &ldquo;real veterans must rise to defend the ANC, not amafake&rdquo;.Among the &ldquo;fake&rdquo; veterans who have spoken out are Rivonia trialists Andrew Mlangeni, Ahmed Kathrada and Denis Goldberg. Zuma&rsquo;s support base in the province faces a renewed threat that may unseat some of his most powerful backers. A high court challenge to the outcome of the KwaZulu-Natal ANC provincial conference last November &ndash; which elected his key lieutenants: chairperson Sihle Zikalala and secretary Super Zuma &ndash; has been placed back on the roll after the ANC&rsquo;s lawyers failed to meet a deadline for submission of documentation central to destroying the credibility of the challenge by supporters of ousted chairperson Senzo Mchunu.The application, brought by disaffected ANC members from 22 branches who were excluded from the voting at the conference, has been set down for November 23 in the Pietermaritzburg High Court. The case had been taken off the roll to allow for an exchange of documents between lawyers for the ANC and those for the applicants, led by Lawrence Dube, the chairperson of its Ward 22 Vryheid branch.The group, which represents branches from several ANC regions, would like the conference result to be set aside and wants it to be rerun.In his affidavit to the court, Dube, an optometrist who has been an ANC member for 15 years, cited the &ldquo;irregular and unconstitutional conduct and outcome&rdquo; of the process leading up to the conference.Dube said the conference was &ldquo;tainted and fatally flawed&rdquo; because their rights as members to participate in the elective conference had been violated during the build-up to and at the conference itself.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
