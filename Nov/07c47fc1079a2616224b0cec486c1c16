There will only be two wards in the Eastern Cape that will close early. Those are Ward 17 Mbashe and Ward 7 in Port St Johns," she said."Sometimes the commission can determine that it does not warrant staying open longer than necessary and the officials can begin the counting process," Bapela added. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
