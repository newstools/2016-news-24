Nceba DladlaNELSON Mandela Bay is one of the districts in the Eastern Cape where municipal by-elections will be held today. Residents of Wards 4 and 14 in the municipality will be expected to use their democratic right to choose a councillor after those that they elected in the recent local government elections either died or resigned.Independent Electoral Commission provincial spokesperson Pearl Ngqoza said preparations were on track in eight local municipalities in the province.Affected in the province are Nelson Mandela Bay, Mbhashe, Nkonkobe/Nxuba, Port St Johns and Mbizana.According to the IEC, political parties hoping to wow voters in Walmer are the ANC, DA, PAC, UFEC, UDM, ACDP and EFF. This is after ANC councillor Nceba Dywili, who was murdered by unknown assailants on the eve of the August elections, won the Ward with 81,41%, followed by the EFF with 8,57%, DA 7,21% and the AIC 1,42%.In Walmer the IEC records that 52%, or 6 044 of the 11 538 registered voters, voted at voting stations that included Walmer Primary School, John Masiza Higher Primary and the temporary station near the graveyard in August. Voting is the constitutional right of each electorate and it is important that they elect ward councillors who serve the interest of the voters in the ward. Generally the national average voter turnout for municipal elections is lower than for national and provincial elections. However, pamphlets are being distributed for voter information and posters are being used to publicise the by-elections. In addition to this there are fieldworkers conducting voter education in all the affected wards, Ngoza said.It is believed that a mistake of punting a Northern Areas councillor for a ward that covers New Brighton resulted in a councillor having to resign and so Ward 14 must have a new councillor voted in.Voting stations at the New Brighton Rent Office, Newell and Cowan high schools, Pendla and Molefe primary schools and the Nangoza Jebe Community Hall will be open from 7am today for voters to make their mark . 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
