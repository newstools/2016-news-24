There are other processes that are taking place, which, once the commission has concludes its report, we will have to look at.&rdquo;Government could not accept the idea of fee-free education simply because students demanded it.&ldquo;It is not an easy situation. It does not mean that if the students were not paying, that everything would be free. Government would have to then budget for that, so it needs to be looked at in different ways.&rdquo;He said government was concerned about protests turning violent, and held a meeting with elected student leaders and university management on the subject.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why government is establishing the task team to engage the situation, with the aim to stop violence, but also to talk to the students and stakeholders to say this was not correct to move in the manner that we were.&rdquo;He said the meetings succeeded because it was agreed that students should go back to lectures and write exams.Zuma announced the release of the commission's interim report on Wednesday. It covers only three areas: An overview of the terms of reference, post-school education and training funding, and understanding their operations' costs.Five areas remained outstanding:READ: University fees will riseDemocratic Alliance MP Belinda Bozzoli said the party was disappointed with the interim report. Its findings - that more money was needed - were things the public already knew, she said.Zuma reiterated his point that government was ready to deal with 2017, and would ensure that no child stayed out of school if they were poor or part of the &ldquo;missing middle&rdquo;. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
