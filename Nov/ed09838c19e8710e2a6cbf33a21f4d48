The long-time opposition leader said that it was "incomprehensible" for authorities to act with such impunity.&nbsp;Police, however, denied the claims, saying that opposition party leaders would "say anything in the media in order to remain relevant".Besigye came second in presidential elections that were held in February. He, however,&nbsp;rejected the official results as fraudulent and called for an international audit of the results, one of the reasons cited for charging him with treason.Am now checked-in for my Nairobi flight. Police Offr this morning said I won't go anywhere. We fly &amp; we shall overcome by defiance!! pic.twitter.com/N6NMYT0gLa24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
