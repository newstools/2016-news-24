He was finance minister for four days in December and he and previous Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan's positions were swopped after an outcry over Van Rooyen's appointment as head of the public purse.There have been allegations that his appointment as finance minister was driven by the Guptas.The Guptas have denied all the state-capture allegations levelled at them.On her last day in the position, Madonsela was supposed to have released the report on what has been dubbed ''state capture'' but Zuma indicated his intention to apply for the interdict.It was not released as planned, and was put under lock and key for the handover weekend ahead of Mkhwebane starting on that Monday.At the time, two conflicted statements were also issued from Parliament - one saying they would not accept the report, and a later one chiding the author of the first statement, and saying that Parliament would keep it safe as requested.Mkhwebane said she would have to wait for the court process to conclude before releasing it.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
