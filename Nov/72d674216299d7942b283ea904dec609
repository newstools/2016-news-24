But it's okay; we'll have a high court judge sort it out tomorrow morning.&rdquo;In a tweet on Wednesday, Greeff said: &ldquo;The Sandf has just capitulated. Food has now been delivered to the affected bases. Soldiers are eating. Thanks Sandu. Amazing work!&rdquo;In a letter of demand, Sandu said the SANDF was legally obligated to provide the affected living-in members with daily rations.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
