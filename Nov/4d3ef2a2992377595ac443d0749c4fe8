Acts of intimidation began with threatening messages sent in August and a break-in in her house in September.&nbsp; However, since October, the number of incidents has increased significantly.These include being shot at with ceramic bullets while driving home at night, following which a text message was sent saying, "Next time, won't miss".&nbsp; In another incident, electric wires on her brakes were cut.&nbsp; She has also been the victim of tyre blowouts and punctured tyres.Most recently, this Saturday, her car &ndash; parked at her secret location &ndash; was broken into and goods disturbed, but nothing was taken.Nevertheless, Venter reiterated that she would not drop out of the court case."When [the incidents of intimidation] happen, you are scared for that moment &ndash; but if you look at the overall picture, I have to tell myself I will not allow them to terrorise me.&nbsp; And I will not."Won&rsquo;t back downKrige echoed Venter's sentiments."We will never back down."He said all the journalists wanted was for the newsroom at the SABC not be subjected to interference.A police task team has been established, headed by Lieutenant Colonel Gert Grobler.Gauteng police spokesperson Lungelo Dlamini confirmed the investigation was ongoing.&nbsp;"No one has been arrested," he said.Venter said that those behind the intimidation seemed "quite sophisticated" in their tactics.She said, for example, that the shots angled at her windscreen during one incident were accurately aimed, appearing to have been fired by someone well-trained.&nbsp; She said she was saved because the shooter was too far away and she had protective film over her windows.Krige also said that the case was made complicated by the fact that those involved clearly has certain professional skills such as being able to intercept emails.The Sunday Times cited unnamed sources as saying the text messages had been identified as coming from the cellphone tower nearest the SABC headquarters in Auckland Park.Krige suggest one way to determine who was behind the attacks would be to question who might feel the Constitutional Case was detrimental to their interests."I question their motives&hellip; why be frightened by newsrooms being independent?"&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
