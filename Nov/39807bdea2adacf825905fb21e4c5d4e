Oh ... let&rsquo;s go fly a kite!&rdquo;Muizenberg was turned into a fantasy land this weekend when eyes stared at the sky in wonder.The 22nd Cape Town International Kite Festival, and incidentally Africa&rsquo;s biggest such festival, drew people from all over the world to marvel at the flying wonders.The cynics might wonder what all the fuss is about &ndash; it&rsquo;s just a kite after all.
