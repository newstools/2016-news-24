"In the interests of social harmony at ISTA we have decided to revise the exchange rate (back)," said ISTA director general Kasengedia Mutumbe.Higher Education Minister Theophile Mbemba, said on public television late on Wednesday that Mutumbe had been suspended from his duties pending an enquiry.Anger at the university's initial decision led to several incidents including the burning of two vehicles and attacks on some nearby shopfronts."The police were called to re-establish order, disturbed by the students," said the officer in charge of the operation.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
