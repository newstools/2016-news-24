Thirty-seven people died.On Wednesday, Eliasson said the CAR government, the European Union, the UN and the World Bank had drawn up a "national recovery plan" that would be presented to a donors' conference in Brussels on November 17.Visiting the scene of Sunday's clashes, in a district of the capital called PK5, he told residents, "I have come to hear your grievances so as to present them in Brussels."One of the world's poorest countries, CAR has scarcely emerged from the chaos of civil war which erupted in 2013 following the overthrow of former president Francois Bozize, a Christian, by Muslim rebels from the Seleka coalition. Armed groups have flourished over the years given the weakness of the state. Among the main culprits are factions from the mostly Muslim former Seleka rebel force, and the Christian "anti-Balaka" (anti-machete) militias, a reference to the rebels who use machetes.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
