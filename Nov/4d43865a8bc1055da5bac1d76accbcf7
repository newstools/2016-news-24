The Daily News of Bowling Green reports that many Amish in Auburn have refused to comply with the ordinance, citing concerns that attempts to put the bags on their horses might frighten the animals. Many cases have landed in court, and some defendants have been jailed for refusing to pay the fine for violating the ordinance. Last week, attorney Travis Lock filed a notice arguing that the regulation is unconstitutional because it discriminates against the Amish. "It's being clearly designed to single out the Amish and, frankly, to discriminate against the Amish," Lock said. "This ordinance was passed to target this particular group of Amish in the Auburn community and that in and of itself is unconstitutional and discriminatory." Auburn officials say the ordinance keeps the streets clean and reduces the risk of spreading disease. Logan District Judge Kenneth Williams set a hearing on April 26 in district court to hear oral arguments on the challenge to the ordinance. "Hopefully we can get some sort of resolution shortly after the April date, but realistically there's always other potential appeals after that," said Logan County Attorney Joe Ross, who has been prosecuting the cases.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
