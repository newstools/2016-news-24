There will be no trial within a trial."I ask that the witness is warned with relation to the charges he could face."Chetty proceeded to warn Siyoni to testify honestly so that the charges of conspiracy to commit murder, robbery with aggravating circumstances, murder and defeating or obstructing the ends of justice against him could be discharged."Do you understand the warning?" asked Chetty."Yes, it is clear," said Siyoni. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
