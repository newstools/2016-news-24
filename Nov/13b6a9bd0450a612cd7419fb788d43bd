It was merely an emergency drill, which was mandatory in terms of aviation legislation. This required a full-scale exercise to be conducted every two years, it said in a statement."The purpose is to test the response preparedness of all airport staff and emergency services involved in an aircraft-related incident."The exercise would simulate an emergency involving a plane and passengers."The exercise will be on a large scale and will include emergency services from across the province."Responders did not know the exact time of Wednesday&rsquo;s exercise, in order to create a "surprise factor".&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
