Celeste Perry, an owner at the Fat Cactus Cafe in Gardens, told News24 that the woman had since apologised. She settled the bill on Tuesday afternoon. "I am not going to press any charges. I think the social media embarrassment was enough," Perry said. The woman, who was with a man, spent almost the entire afternoon at the restaurant on Saturday, ordering food and margaritas. The couple left without paying the bill. They were, however, caught on film and Perry uploaded the video clip and photos to her personal Facebook page. By Tuesday, the video had been viewed more than 380 000 times and had been shared more than 10 000 times. Perry said the woman claimed that the man that accompanied her to the restaurant had left her with the entire bill. Perry said the waiter had since received a tip and they had donated the rest of the money to charity. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
