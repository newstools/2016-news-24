Ssimbwa was then contracted by BMP as a lawyer to secure the contract to supply Kampala with equipment including 375 tanks, 46 reconnaissance Ferret and Eland armoured cars and various artillery.Spokesperson Kayima said investigators had asked BMP Poland "to provide police with evidence regarding the fraud".Strong arm of law&nbsp;A BMP representative contacted at company headquarters in Warsaw confirmed it had "contacts in Uganda" but declined to comment "until the situation is resolved". Uganda's army refuted press reports that the army chief was implicated in the scandal. It also denied the military investigative branch's deputy had been transferred to Somalia in secret while investigating the case.Ugandan newspaper The Daily Monitor reported that negotiations with the BMP were held inside the army headquarters in the presence of men in uniform. The army denied any such meeting took place. "The public is hereby assured that the reports are unfounded, malicious and aimed at tainting the hard earned good image of the Uganda People's Defence Forces," spokesperson Paddy Ankunda said in a statement."Any persons who try to break this bond will be stopped using the strong arm of the law", he added.The purported Defence ministry documents said Uganda's military was also looking for body armour, anti-riot equipment, armoured personnel carriers and self-propelled artillery systems.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
