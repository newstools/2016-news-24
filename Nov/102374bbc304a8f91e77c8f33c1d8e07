He&rsquo;s agreed with us on that point. And that is all there is to it," she said in a telephone interview."It&rsquo;s not an acquittal, so it doesn&rsquo;t have that effect," she added.Bronkhorst's lawyers had applied to have the charges against him dropped last year when the Zimbabwe government said it would not pursue Palmer over the case.Said Dube: "I think [Bronkhorst] is relieved&hellip; this has been a pretty harrowing experience for him. It&rsquo;s been a long year."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
