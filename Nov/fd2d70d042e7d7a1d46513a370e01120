Instead, Essa said it was people walking by and dropping their rubbish as they went.Essa said although Hygienic Tissues was far from the river, their property was not free from the illegal dumping by passersby. &ldquo;We have been complaining to the municipality for a while now,&rdquo; said Essa. &ldquo;There is rubbish everywhere, especially where there is open land, because it is easy to get to.&rdquo;Councillor for the area, Mike Amod said after a letter, titled &ldquo;Lack of respect shown to Eastwood&rdquo; was printed in The Witness in late September, he contacted Msunduzi&rsquo;s environmental health department.He said he followed up with the department on October 20, and was told compliance notices had been served on all offenders. &ldquo;I am following up this matter on a weekly basis as the situation causes an eyesore to the entrance of Eastwood and if left unchecked, it could lead to serious pollution of the Baynespruit river as a result of the upcoming summer rain storms,&rdquo; said Amod.Meanwhile, piles of rubbish are also mounting on both sides of the informal settlment Jika Joe&rsquo;s fences, with more waste tossed onto the growing stacks each day.When asked about the progress made with regard to the illegal dumping in Eastwood and whether Jika Joe residents had been given means to dispose of their rubbish, Msunduzi acting municipal spokesperson Siyabonga Hlongwa said they were &ldquo;consulting the relevant department internally&rdquo;.&ldquo;We will respond respectively once the information is available to us,&rdquo; said Hlongwa.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
