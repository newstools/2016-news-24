This after the ANC NDC on Thursday announced his suspension following a disciplinary hearing, which he had skipped.Fransman was found guilty of two counts of misconduct &ndash; &ldquo;abusing his office for the purpose of attempting to obtain a sexual favour from Louisa Wynand and for making public statements which brought the ANC into disrepute&rdquo;.Wynand opened a case with the police in January, accusing Fransman of sexual assault while the party was holding its January 8 celebrations in the North West. The NDC also said Fransman&rsquo;s claims of not having received documents prior to the hearing were &ldquo;misleading the public&rdquo;.'Hell bent on getting rid of certain people'But Fransman hit back on Thursday, saying the NDC was lying to the public.The whole hearing had been a kangaroo court of note, he added.&ldquo;It is sad that people are putting their integrity at risk for a national conference.&ldquo;It is clear that the faction around [ANC secretary general Gwede] Mantashe is hell bent on getting rid of certain people,&rdquo; he said. Fransman said he hadn&rsquo;t had a chance yet to look at the suspension, and would make an official announcement once he had.But what he knew for sure, he said, was that he would be appealing it.&ldquo;The NDC has just shown their true colours. I will not allow the organisation to become one which doesn&rsquo;t care for poor of the poor in the Western Cape,&rdquo; he said.'Factional madness'"It really is a joke what&rsquo;s been done to me. But I do understand in the context of 2017 factional madness,&rdquo; he said.He raised concerns that he had been suspended, while Western Cape secretary Faiez Jacobs, who is facing an assault charge, was allowed to &ldquo;continue leading&rdquo;. &ldquo;So they would allow a convicted fraudster like Jonton Synman and someone who assaults staff like Jacobs to stay,&rdquo; he said.Fransman, who was accused of sexual harassment, said the party had tried to find straws to get rid of him.But he was not about leadership positions, he said, and would continue his work in the province.&ldquo;I am focused on the poor working masses of SA. I am about the Khoi, the San, Bushman community. The people who face hardships every day. Positions come and go,&rdquo; he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
