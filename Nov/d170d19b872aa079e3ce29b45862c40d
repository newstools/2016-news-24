It means the SAPS, who are supposed to be independent, have taken a side and are actively campaigning for the ruling party instead of guarding the elections and ensuring full support of the IEC in the interests of the Electoral Act."Ndlozi said the alleged actions of the police risked rendering the by-elections "not free, as well as not fair"."How can men and women with guns and in police uniform go around picking up civilians to vote for the ruling party? It is clear that ordinary civilians are being coerced and intimidated by the police firstly to vote, but secondly, to vote for the ANC."He said the actions could be taken as a "dress rehearsal on the part of the ANC for what will happen in 2019".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
