It was initially meant to be made public on October 14, but was&nbsp;delayed by a bid from Zuma to interdict it. In the report, Madonsela points out that the president may have violated the executive ethics code through his relationship with the influential Gupta family. It is alleged that the Guptas used their ties with Zuma to influence the awarding of state-owned enterprises' contracts and key decisions, such as the appointments of ministers.Mantashe said, in principle, the NWC supported a commission of inquiry into allegations of "state capture", but that it should be set up like any other judicial inquiry where the president of the country not only appoints the inquiry, but the judge as well.Madonsela's report recommended that Zuma appoint the inquiry, but not the judge to oversee it.&nbsp;"As a matter of principle, we support an inquiry into the issue," said Mantashe.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
