Does this show any respect for the rule of law?&ldquo;Perhaps he is just following the example of his leader, JZ 783. One can&rsquo;t help remembering &lsquo;Khwezi&rsquo;, and the fate she suffered," Robinson said, referring to Zuma's 2006 rape accuser, Fezekile Ntsukela Kuzwayo.ObjectionANC MPs objected to Robinson&rsquo;s remarks.Bhekizizwe Radebe said Robinson used &ldquo;offensive language&rdquo; in describing Zuma and should withdraw the remark.Steenhuisen tried to object, but Mbete shut him down and asked Robinson to withdraw the comment.&ldquo;Honourable Speaker, I&rsquo;m confused. What is derogatory about saying &lsquo;JZ 783&rsquo;?&rdquo; Robinson asked.&ldquo;You are casting aspersions,&rdquo; Mbete replied.EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi then rose and said: &ldquo;There is no JZ 783 in this House.&rdquo;The matter of Zuma&rsquo;s corruption charges is currently before the Supreme Court of Appeal, after the High Court in Pretoria ruled that the National Prosecuting Authority should review its decision to drop the case against him. Mbete said if Robinson would not withdraw, she would be asked to leave the House. She refused, and the party left with her.As the DA MPs were leaving, Steenhuisen told Mbete the party would take her to court. He said the rules did not allow her to make such a ruling, due to the fact that it was a joint sitting with the NCOP.DA MPs leave the House during #16DaysOfActivism debate after Baleka Mbete orders MP Denise Robinson to withdraw "JZ 783" comment. @News24 pic.twitter.com/ibKHMXOBYC&mdash; Paul Herman (@PaulTHerman) November 22, 2016DA MPs leave the House during #16DaysOfActivism debate after Baleka Mbete orders MP Denise Robinson to withdraw "JZ 783" comment. @News24 pic.twitter.com/ibKHMXOBYC&nbsp; 'Grossly unreasonable'EFF chief whip Floyd Shivambu called the decision &ldquo;grossly unreasonable and unfair&rdquo;.In response, ANC deputy chief whip Doris Dlakude said Robinson was &ldquo;casting aspersions&rdquo; on the president, and MPs could not allow &ldquo;lying&rdquo; in Parliament.Freedom Front Plus parliamentary leader Petrus Groenewald rebuked both parties during his speech, saying Parliament's attitude toward the issue is reflected in its speeches.MPs were meant to set the example for children watching. Observers in the public gallery applauded Groenewald as he spoke.Later in the debate, ANC MP Mervyn Dirks said Robinson's comment was inappropriate given the subject matter of the debate. He described the EFF's defence of the DA as &ldquo;dogs defending their master&rdquo;.Shivambu replied that the same applied to ANC MPs who &ldquo;immediately jumped to the defence of their master,&rdquo; Zuma.Minister of Women, Susan Shabangu, had the last word. She said the ANC welcomed Wisani's guilty verdict and would never condone violence against women.She was very disappointed that the DA brought the subject during its speech.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
