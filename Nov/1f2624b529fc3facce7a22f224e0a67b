If the vote does indeed fail, Zuma will indeed be weakened, leaving scorched earth or bumble along scenarios as his only two options, said Montalto. #ANCNEC President Zuma might be jetting off to Cuba tomorrowNews24 s Mahlatse Gallen reports: President Jacob Zuma is continuing with his duties on Monday afternoon as a heated ANC National Executive Committee meeting discussing his fate continues in Pretoria.The Presidency released a short statement shortly after a Presidential motorcade left St George s Hotel where the NEC meeting is underway. The statement said Zuma is meeting with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. The two Heads of State are expected to review bilateral co-operation between their two countries as well as the latest regional political and security developments in the continent, presidential spokesperson Bongani&nbsp; Ngqulunga said. On Sunday, Zuma s defenders were optimistic that they will defeat the motion tabled by Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom for the president to step down as party leader. They admitted that they were ambushed by the motion on Saturday, with some of his supporters not attending the final NEC meeting for the year. More of his defenders including Water Affairs Minister Nomvula Mokonyane were expected to address the meeting.34 members apparently say that the President should step down while 30 members want him to stay, according to reports from 702. #ANCNEC President Zuma will this afternoon host Ugandan President Museveni.

"The effects of a stronger dollar and the possible US interest rate increase put pressure on our currency."&nbsp;"Ultimately, the recall of Zuma would be seen by markets as initially positive, which would lead to volatility on the stronger side, but greater political and policy certainty beyond the reign of President Zuma would be needed before any meaningful and more long-term strength is felt."&nbsp;#ANCNEC Various media houses are camped outside the St George Hotel, the NEC is still locked in talks. pic.twitter.com/1bUEqvvu5oHahaha, thanks Palesa! I value your friendship. In meeting for rest of today, then getting back to my tourism tweets https://t.co/QcBMQqmbtCAccording to reports filtering in from the ANC NEC gathering, ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa has indicated that the meeting "will go on till very late", without any further clarification given.&nbsp;#ANCNEC loooong wait for journalists, basking in the Tshwane sunTrump, Zuma and ratings reprieve boost rand&nbsp;A mixture of a weakening dollar caused by Donald Trump s future presidency, rating agency reviews in South Africa on Friday and a party meeting that could unseat President Jacob Zuma has seen the rand strengthen by almost 2% on Monday morning. The rand, trading as low as R13.83 to the dollar at 10:20, had broken through the R14 ceiling earlier on Monday, amid a report by News24 that three cabinet ministers had called on Zuma to step down or that the ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) vote to remove him.&nbsp;The main reason for the rand s strength however was the result of the dollar weakening across the board. "Late Friday and early Monday price action suggest that the election-related upside in the dollar and treasury yields is finally petering out," said RMB analyst John Cairns in a note on Monday. "This has allowed some good rallies in emerging market and risk currencies, with the dollar dropping below R14 for the first time since the election."&nbsp;Trevor Manuel is worried Mpumalanga and Kwazulu Natal are becoming Zuma&#39;s &quot;man cave&quot;. https://t.co/mUaoi5T5Qe pic.twitter.com/N7SCHRrOePIt&#39;s not @Derek_Hanekom&#39;s personal battle or angst.

"We are not aware of any justified reasons for the president to not conclude his term of office," ANC provincial spokesperson Mdumiseni Ntuli said on Monday. Ntuli was speaking outside the Durban Magistrate's Court where Dawie Kriel, who stands accused of making a racist Facebook post, appeared. Ntuli said the KwaZulu-Natal branch of the party had heard of the NEC development in the news.&nbsp;In the ANC telling someone you have no confidence in him/her and citing your reasons, that&#39;s not grounds for dismissal. @KrilaGP https://t.co/8HBcklIkmsYes, that&#39;s what the Gupta&#39;s taught you, but politics are far much more complex my brother.

Says he will express his views at NEC today. #ANCNEC @News24 https://t.co/gMxrMrVw9QOPINION:&nbsp;Will Zuma go today?&nbsp;By&nbsp;Alet Janse van Rensburg&nbsp;The extended ANC NEC meeting is undoubtedly one of the most important political events in South Africa for the past decade, says Prof. Susan Booysen, a lecturer of politics at University of the Witwatersrand. "The extended NEC meeting is certainly not normal and we know that what is unfolding are deliberations at the highest level about the future of the president," she says. "We know what is at stake. We know he'll go in due course, but it is also important to see when he goes. For the first time in almost a decade the NEC is waking up, saying they're seriously considering recalling the president." Booysen says this is significant because the NEC members have to overcome their own hurdles, such as their deep loyalty to President Jacob Zuma. At the same time there is a history of damage caused to the party by recalling President Thabo Mbeki that would be fresh in everyone's minds.&nbsp; Jump to top
