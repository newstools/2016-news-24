The findings contained in the last report on the matter, and which McBride signed, exonerated Dramat and differed greatly from an earlier report implicating him in the renditions.According to a report by law firm Werksmans Attorneys, portions of statements by individuals who implicated Dramat in the illegal renditions and which appeared in the first report, were left out of the second report.McBride has maintained that the earlier report did not take all the facts into account.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
