"Customers are urged to lessen the high water usage and start to conserve water as every drop counts," said city spokesperson Lindela Mashigo. The Block L main reservoir is close to empty, and this will affect Blocks AA, CC, F, G, UU, VV, VW and Soshanguve east. Blocks K, L and M, have already experienced water shortages. Water tankers have been arranged, with distribution being co-ordinated through ward councillors. Pretoria East is also in danger of running out of water, with the Garsfontein reservoir standing at 27%. The Department of Water and Sanitation has warned that the Vaal Dam, which supplies water to about 12 million people and businesses, is at 26.6% capacity. The department might release water from its reserve, the Sterkfontein Dam, into the Vaal Dam on Monday, if there is no rainfall by then. All nine provinces in the country have been affected by the current drought and municipalities are upping water restrictions. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
