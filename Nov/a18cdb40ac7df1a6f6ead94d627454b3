The party welcomed the improvement in clean audits nationally, but was not satisfied with the findings overall, and&nbsp;had areas of concern, spokesperson Zizi Kodwa told News24 on Wednesday.Auditor General Kimi Makwetu said earlier on Wednesday that the overall national average of 32% clean audits across all provinces, departments, and entities was too low, despite an 8% increase nationally.He was releasing the Auditor General&rsquo;s report on national and provincial audit outcomes for the 2015/16 financial year.&nbsp;The ANC shared Makwetu&rsquo;s concerns about the governance and stability of some of state-owned enterprises. Prasa had irregular expenditure of R13.9 billion.Kodwa said the ANC was concerned about the R46 billion in irregular expenditure national and provincial government departments racked up in the 2015/16 financial year.Some departments were ignoring the AG&rsquo;s findings, and the party would call on its deployees in under-performing departments to be held to account.&ldquo;Our deployees must protect public money against wasteful expenditure and non-adherence to supply chain processes.&rdquo;The idea of the Auditor General receiving binding powers, like the public protector, had merit and would be considered, he said.A lot still needed to be done to improve supply-chain management, as it was vulnerable to corruption.DA gloats over Western Cape performanceThe Western Cape received clean audits for 79% of its departments and entities, while Gauteng came second with 60%.The other provinces' clean audit findings were: KwaZulu-Natal, 33%, Eastern Cape, 32%, Northern Cape, 30%, Mpumalanga, 29%, Free State, 11%, North West, 9%, and Limpopo 0%.DA MP Kevin Mileham said not one Western Cape department received an adverse audit outcome. Irregular expenditure had decreased from R124m to R28m.He said officials lacked the discipline to prepare accurate financial and performance reports."This is characteristic of ANC-run governments across the country and is further proof that the ANC cares more about lining cadres&rsquo; pockets than the millions of South Africans who are left without access to basic services as a result of perpetual corruption," he said.He bemoaned the ANC's showing in Mpumalanga, Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, and Limpopo. They recorded irregular expenditure of R4bn, R1.2bn, R1.8bn, and R1bn respectively.Kodwa said the DA's success in the Western Cape was more indicative of the history of the province, and its abundance of personnel with expertise in financial management.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
