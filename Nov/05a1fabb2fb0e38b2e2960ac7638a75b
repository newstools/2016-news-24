And if the situation continues as it is, it makes the working relationship between the minister and the Ipid head relatively difficult. For both parties, it is an impasse,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;The matter fell away in October when the minister asked the speaker referred Nhleko&rsquo;s request to Parliament&rsquo;s police committee.But the committee could not proceed as it needed to be a resolution in the National Assembly for any committee of Parliament to deal with the matter.McBride returned to work after his suspension was set aside by the Constitutional Court. However, the ruling was suspended for 30 days to allow Parliament and the Minister to decide on the disciplinary steps against McBride.&nbsp;Nhleko wrote a letter to the speaker in September asking for a committee to be set up, but in a response in October, she told him his request could not be processed before the expiry of a 30-day deadline.&nbsp;Subsections 17DA(3) to 17DA(7) of the South African Police Services Act says the Ipid head may be removed from office on the grounds of misconduct, incapacity or incompetence on a finding to that effect by a committee of the National Assembly.Or this could be done through the adoption of a resolution by the National Assembly calling for the removal of that person. The resolution, however, would need a two-thirds majority to pass.The minister may suspend the national head of the directorate from office at any time after the start of the proceedings of a committee of the National Assembly for the removal of that person, according to the act. &nbsp;&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
