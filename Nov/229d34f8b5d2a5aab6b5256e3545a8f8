The demonstration planned against the introduction of bond notes failed to take off on Friday, after the violence against the organisers. The European Union delegation in Harare said in a statement on Friday that social activists were brutalised before the anti-government demonstration. The EU statement expressed concern at the recent growth of human rights violations in Zimbabwe. Local media reported that six people were beaten and two cars were burned on Thursday night in what was seen as a warning against going ahead with the protests. President Robert Mugabe's government, in power since independence from Britain in 1980, is facing an economic crisis that has caused massive cash shortages. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
