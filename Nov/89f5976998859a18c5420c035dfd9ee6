While he is regularly praised for the stability and economic performance of his small nation, Kagame is also often criticised by rights groups for lack of political freedoms and freedom of expression.Rwanda is constitutionally a multi-party system but there is practically no opposition within the country.All recognised parties generally support the policy decisions made by the ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) - with the exception of the small Democratic Green Party which was the only one to object to the 2015 constitution changes.In 2010 Rwandan opposition figure Victoire Ingabire was arrested shortly after her return from exile to Rwanda to run for election.After laying flowers at the genocide memorial in Kigali, Ingabire called for the perpetrators of crimes against the Hutu majority also to be pursued and prosecuted.She was convicted in 2013 for her comments, viewed as "genocide denial", and is currently serving a 15-year prison sentence.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
