We have lost five men, our homes and our food," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.News of the attack has been slow to emerge because of the destroyed telecommunications infrastructure in northeast Nigeria, and restricted access.The villages that the jihadists raided were located near Chibok, where Boko Haram kidnapped more than 200 schoolgirls two years ago.They are also near the Sambisa Forest, one of the group's last bastions.Boko Haram's insurgency in Nigeria's predominantly-Muslim north has claimed at least 20 000 lives and made more than 2.6 million homeless. Nigerian troops with the help of neighbouring countries have recaptured swathes of territory from Boko Haram since early 2015, but the extremists have carried out sporadic attacks on remote villages in the restive region. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
