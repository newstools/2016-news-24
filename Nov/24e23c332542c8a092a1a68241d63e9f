I found out that pastors can lie to you. Michaels is lying."But Michaels denied he had known about what happened."Nobody told me about it until a case was lodged with the police," he said.The defence previously focused on disproving dates and other events associated with the case, such as when the church was built, and where a Bible study group met.The case was postponed to December 6 for testimony by a doctor.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
