Nobody robs a vehicle on the passenger's side," he said.Hassan, 45, was shot several times while in a car outside his home in Lansdowne late on Monday.It is understood that he died in hospital.Hassan had apparently been with a Lansdowne police reservist, inside the reservist's car, at the time of the attack.Paying their last respects"When the shooting started, he [the reservist] ran out the vehicle and ran for his life," said Loonat."But according to him, he could feel bullets [flying] around him."Loonat joined a large crowd gathered outside Hassan's mother's home in Lansdowne on Tuesday afternoon.Neighbours, friends, family, lawyers and associates came to pay their respects at the modest white house attached to the store the Hassan brothers ran.A dark blue funeral home van stood parked outside.Loonat said he believed that someone had been following Hassan and monitoring his daily routine.Motive unknownPolice spokesperson Constable Noloyiso Rwexana said the shooting happened at 22:05 on Monday in Burwood Road, Crawford.One gunman was involved in the shooting and no arrests have been made, Rwexana said.While some sources close to Hassan said his killing could be linked to his work, Rwexana said "the motive for the murder is yet to be established".Dawood Khan, a business associate who had worked with Hassan for 11 years, said he was devastated when he heard the news on Monday night."He was a hard-working person and very dedicated to his clients and business."He said Hassan was also very spiritual and loved his wife and children.Previous attacksPete Mihalik, an advocate who worked with Hassan, was very emotional as he reflected on their 18-year relationship.He said Hassan never discriminated and believed in everyone deserved a fair trial.
