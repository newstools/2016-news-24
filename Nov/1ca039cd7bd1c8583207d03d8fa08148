Helsinki â€” Finland says it will start to operate the world's first
icebreaker powered by liquefied natural gas on Tuesday as the number of
LNG-powered vessels is steadily increasing in the Nordic country that is
surrounded by the Baltic Sea and is heavily reliant on maritime transport. The
state-owned operator Arctia Ltd. said on Monday that the 128 million-euro Polaris
icebreaker, which also runs on low-sulphur diesel, is equipped with two large
LNG containers allowing it two operate for 10 days in rough ice conditions
without refuelling. The
first LNG import terminal in Finland was opened in the western port of Pori in
September. Finland,
which commissioned its first icebreaker in 1890, currently has a fleet of eight
icebreakers, operating mostly in the northern part of the Baltic Sea and the
Gulf of Finland.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
