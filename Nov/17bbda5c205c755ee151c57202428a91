Castro believed "revolution was not something you paid for," said Roque."They were very much punching above their weight, they were a small island that had such a big ambitious project in Angola," she added.Even African countries with lesser links to Cuba, such as South Sudan, had liberation movement leaders trained in Havana."Southern Africa freedom is inextricably intertwined with the history of Cuba," said Mac Maharaj, an ANC veteran and fellow inmate of Nelson Mandela, South Africa's late anti-apartheid icon.After Namibia won independence from South Africa in 1990, shortly after Cuito Cuanavale, apartheid would fall and the African National Congress (ANC), led by the freed Mandela, won its first free elections in 1994.Unbreakable bond"Fidel became a huge inspiration. There in an unbreakable bond between Cuba and the southern African struggle," said Maharaj.It was Castro who received the "loudest applause" from the audience at the inauguration of Mandela as president, according to the late former president's friend in the struggle against apartheid, Ahmed Kathrada.And three decades after the end of Cuba's military involvement, Havana's contribution to Angola and southern Africa is still alive.More than 42% of healthcare workers in Angola are Cubans, many of whom decided to stay on after the war.Elsewhere in the region, South African state security, intelligence officers still go for training in Cuba, according to Roque.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
