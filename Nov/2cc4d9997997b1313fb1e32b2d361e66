They would take it up with party whips and call for the committee&rsquo;s term to be extended. This might involve having to work during the holidays.The committee had received over 480 applications for the positions by the closing date of November 18.EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said Monday&rsquo;s meeting was &ldquo;mayhem&rdquo;. It lacked administrative efficiency and MPs needed to stick to deadlines, he said.Opposition MPs called on their ANC counterparts to make the CVs of all the candidates available to them.Ndlozi, DA MP Yusuf Cassim and AIC MP Mahlubanzima Jafta wanted physical copies of the CVs. Other MPs insisted they did not need all of them.&ldquo;We need to look through all the CVs, to show South Africans that their applications were not prejudiced,&rdquo; Ndlozi said.Looking at only some CVs would give the impression that they had pre-selected the candidates, he said.The committee would try to meet again this week.&nbsp;&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
