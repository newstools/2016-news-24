I will definitely challenge this in the highest courts,&rdquo; he said.He would not comment on the reason for his removal from the job. The Citizen reported on Monday that it had terminated his contract with immediate effect.&ldquo;Mr Motale was suspended from his duties earlier this month, pending the outcome of an internal disciplinary process,&rdquo; publisher Eureka Zandberg said in a statement to staff on Monday.&ldquo;The Citizen contended that the failure of Mr Motale to follow agreed-upon editorial procedures and to uphold his editorial duties led to an irretrievable breakdown in the relationship of trust and confidence between the editor and the publisher of the newspaper.&rdquo;She said it was not about the stories the newspaper had published.&ldquo;On the contrary, The Citizen upholds the highest standards of editorial freedom and fully endorses the editorial prerogative to determine what is and is not published.&rdquo;I was today dismissed as editor of The Citizen without any hearing. My legal team is handling the matter.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
