"During this transition period between the two secretary-generals, Burundi would not want to be caught off guard by the appointment of a new envoy," said Ambassador Albert Shingiro."Burundi would like there to be broad consultations between the government of Burundi and the two secretary-generals to consider a successor," Shingiro told AFP.Burundi has been in turmoil since Nkurunziza announced plans in April last year to run for a third term, which he went on to win.Human rights abuses&nbsp;More than 500 people have been killed and at least 300 000 have fled the country. Benomar was appointed in November last year to try to push the government into holding talks with the opposition and to agree to the deployment of 228 UN police to monitor security and human rights abuses. Burundi had initially said it was ready to accept only a few dozen UN police on its territory, but it now maintains that African Union observers can take on the monitoring role.Tanzania's former president Benjamin Mpaka has been appointed by the African Union as a peace mediator, but the government has yet to agree to talks with the opposition. A previous UN envoy, Said Djinnit, resigned in June 2015 amid accusations that he was biased in favor of the government.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
