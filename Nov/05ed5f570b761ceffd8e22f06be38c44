His wife told us she was disgusted that we had the guts to go around telling the world that we had been married for three years. She said we were disrespectful."Nonkululeko said they were now living in fear."He threatened to send men to dismantle our house because all along he thought we were sisters. We have been living in lodges and hotels because we are afraid to go back there."Nonkululeko said she feared that men would be sent to rape as a form of "corrective rape"."They told us they will send men to marry us. They also said that Nokuthula made me a lesbian but that is not true, I am the one who told her that I loved her."Constitutional rightsShe said they had tried to get help from the police through a protection order but Ndlela allegedly refused to sign."We just want to live in peace like everyone else in the community. We want Ndlela to respect us like we respect him, we have done nothing wrong," she said.When News24 asked Ndlela to comment on the matter he said he could not do so at the moment.KwaZulu-Natal chairperson of the House of Traditional Leaders Inkosi Phathizwe Chiliza said what was happening to the couple went against the Constitution."Nothing that goes against the Constitution will be tolerated in communities."Chiliza said everyone had the right to love whoever they wanted to love."Even if it goes against your beliefs, you have no right to infringe upon other people's rights. You have no right to judge others because that is the way they were created."Chiliza said traditional leaders were there to bring peace in communities."They need to report the matter to the local inkosi and the matter should be heard at the local traditional court. The induna must bring proof of his allegations but he has no right to chase people out of the community."Land issueKwaNgcolosi chief Inkosi Nkosinathi Bhengu said the issue was not about sexuality."The Induna informed me that someone from KwaNgcolosi who lived in that house gave them the house without informing him. He said those people were not from the KwaNgcolosi clan."Bhengu said a decision was taken two years ago that people not belonging to the clan would no longer be accepted into the community."The land that is left has been reserved for the next generation."Bhengu said the clan did not discriminate against homosexuals."Why would we judge someone based on their sexuality? The issue here is not about sexuality, it is about land."Durban Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Centre's Sbongiseni Khumalo said even if the dispute was about land, culture was still a barrier for homosexuals in South Africa both in rural and urban areas."There is a general lack of information in rural areas and that is why people's rights are violated. We need to educate traditional leaders on sexuality because some of them do not accept that we are all different," said Khumalo. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
