The Verano Port Villa has been burning since Wednesday, sending thick plumes across the harbour. The fishing factory ship was carrying polystyrene containers and diesel when it was docked in the container basin of the harbour. Fire services spokesperson Liezl Moodie said the firefighters had to get off the ship because it was tilting and becoming unstable as water leaked through holes. Firefighters were monitoring the ship to assess what to do next. No other vessels in the vicinity were affected. Five crew members who had to be evacuated when the fire started on Wednesday were not injured. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
