After a six-month-long recruitment process, the position was offered to Seeraj Mohamed.Muller said he was more qualified for the job, as he had a PhD and Mohamed did not. He had also acted in the job for three months and had the relevant experience, Muller told the CCMA.He questioned if panel in charge of the selection had been properly constituted.Mpumelelo Tabata, representing Parliament, asked Muller if he was now a disgruntled former employee.Jealous?&ldquo;Are you jealous that the post was not offered to you?&rdquo; Tabata asked.Muller denied that he was jealous and said he had left because he had become frustrated.&ldquo;Are you an arrogant person Mr Muller? Why would you say the selection panel is not worthy of assessing you?&rdquo; Tabata asked him.He replied that he was an expert in his area and he did not think it was arrogant to examine someone&rsquo;s qualifications&nbsp;and&nbsp;say they could not possibly have any idea of what his economic or mathematical modelling ability was, as they had never done it.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not arrogant. That speaks to qualifications and expertise,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Tabata asked him if the thought the CCMA commissioner was worthy of assessing him.He asked Muller if he was &ldquo;emotional&rdquo; about not getting the job, and had &ldquo;sour grapes&rdquo;. He accused him of fighting his case through the media and being vindictive.Most of his evidence, Tabata said, had nothing to do with the scope of the case, and was not relevant to the issue at hand.Muller said the case had nothing to do with sour grapes. He had tried as hard as he could before quitting.The hearing continues.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
