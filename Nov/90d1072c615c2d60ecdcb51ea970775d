The Zuma presidency has been a blight on South Africa - only his resignation can help repair the damage he has caused,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;Maimane said the report pointed to significant wrongdoing for which Zuma, his son Duduzane, and the Guptas were to blame.&ldquo;The manner in which Jacob Zuma has conducted himself is completely dishonourable and unbecoming of the nation&rsquo;s President. He has actively tried to delay the release of this report, disrespected the Office of the Public Protector, and wasted millions of rands of public money in frivolous litigation,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;If he did not resign, the DA would ask for Parliament to debate another motion of no confidence in him. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
