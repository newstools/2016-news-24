According to Punch, the influential TV evangelist said that his prophecy was not off the mark, adding that people needed "spiritual understanding" to be able to interpret it. Joshua said this during a service at the headquarters of his church in Lagos on Sunday."There was nothing controversial about the prophecy. It is human beings that are controversial&hellip; We are not on the same level (of spiritual understanding"). Joshua predicted just before the US vote that Clinton would win the election in a "narrow victory".But on Wednesday last week, Trump was declared victorious, after capturing Wisconsin&rsquo;s 10 electoral votes, putting him over the 270 threshold.Social media users immediately took to Twitter to mock his inaccurate prophecy. The prediction was consequently deleted but&nbsp;reinstated again on his official Facebook page.According to BBC, some of his supporters defended him, saying that his prophecy was indeed realised, "because Clinton won the popular vote, although she still lost the election based on the US system of the electoral college votes". A new statement on Joshua's Facebook echoed this argument, saying:"We have seen the outcome of the election in America. Having read, you will notice that it is all about the popular vote, the vote of the majority of Americans."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
