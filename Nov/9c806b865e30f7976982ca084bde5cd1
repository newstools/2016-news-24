Authorities uncovered the plot on October 8, arresting four people who turned out to be former members of Compaore's presidential guard. The 2015 coup bid was staged by presidential guard troops loyal to Compaore but thwarted by street protesters and the army, which attacked their barracks.News of the thwarted October coup came just days after Burkina Faso authorities announced the release of Colonel Mamadou Bamba, who had read out the coup plotters' statements on television at the time. Since independence, the former French colony of Haute Volta, renamed Burkina Faso in 1984, has experienced eight successful coups d'etat.Of its nine presidents, only three have been civilians while the other six were putschist officers.Kabore also used the ceremony to urge vigilance against the "permanent threat of terrorism" in a country whose estimated 17-million population is roughly 60 percent Muslim, according to a 2006 census, with Christianity and traditional beliefs also widely practised.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
