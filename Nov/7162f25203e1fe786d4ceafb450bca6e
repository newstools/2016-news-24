Nceba DladlaTHE provincial Department of Education says it is pleased with the positive start to the writing of matric examinations last week.Department spokesperson Mali Mtima said everything had been going on well with the writing of examinations in the province. Mtima said his department had approached these examinations with the hope of improving on last year s results and it was well prepared. This comes after teachers took pupils through a thorough revision after Saturday morning and evening classes they attended throughout the province. According to Mtima, they also made use of radio stations to prepare the pupils to make sure that they were more than ready to be examined. In fact, we can say we are pleased with the manner in which examinations have been going on since last week, he said. Everything went well except for the more than 390 children who experienced diarrhoea in the King William s Town district after drinking sour milk (amasi) from the school nutrition programme. He said the numbers reported of affected pupils were fluctuating but he was sure more than 390 children had been treated by the Department of Health for food-borne sickness. In a meeting between the two departments last Friday it was said that the affected children were receiving treatment and the food had been sent for testing. Asked to respond on allegations that Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University students embroiled in the month-long #feesmustfall strike were talking to matrics in Nelson Mandela Bay to ask them to abandon the exams and join them in the strike, Mtima said he heard about the rumour but nothing official had come to the department s notice. We hear people talking about that and mentioning certain schools, but nothing official has come to our attention. We ll deal with it if and when it comes, Mtima said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
