He also said Mthembu had tried to "capture" him.Mthembu said the comments were clearly designed to threaten and blackmail him and the ANC in Parliament into silence over the SABC and suggested&nbsp;he was driven by ulterior motives.Parliament is currently holding an inquiry into the SABC board. One of the concerns raised by MPs was the reappointment of Motsoeneng in an executive position after being ordered by Supreme Court of Appeal that he leave his position as COO.In the court papers, Mthembu is seeking payment of R1m, an unconditional apology from Motsoeneng, and costs. The apology must be both in print and on public broadcast within seven days of the court's judgment."The chief whip remains unshaken and unintimidated by Mr Motsoeneng&rsquo;s spurious allegations and attempted blackmail, and is hopeful that a favourable judgment of the Court would dissuade Mr Motsoeneng from making similar thoughtless utterances in future."Motsoeneng's lawyer Advocate Zola Majavu said they would not comment on the suit."We will deal with that in court when it happens," he told News24.'He should not talk too much'Motsoeneng had made the comments on air at a New Age breakfast held on October 27.At the breakfast, he said Mthembu "should not talk too much" and should allow Parliament's portfolio committee on communications to handle the SABC.He said he met Mthembu at an unnamed hotel and suggested the meeting was an attempt to "capture him"."Jackson Mthembu should be the last person to talk about the SABC," Motsoeneng had said."I met so many people, and they know they cannot capture me. That is reality."So he should not talk too much, and he can't say he is leading the process of the SABC and make noise, even before the process of the portfolio committee [is complete]."He suggested Mthembu was trying to influence Parliament's portfolio committee on communications into then finalising the inquiry into the board.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
