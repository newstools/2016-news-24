In her report, Madonsela recommended that Constitutional Court Chief Justice Mokgoeng Mokgoeng nominate a judge to the inquiry.Powers called into questionREAD: #StateCaptureReport: What next?Madonsela was investigating allegations of an improper relationship between Zuma and the powerful and politically-connected Gupta family whom the president has referred to as his friends.Madonsela said in the report she didn't have the resources to finish the investigation and recommended a judicial inquiry.Maine said the Public Protector does not have the powers to do so."The Constitution of SA does not give the lady that power, including the Constitutional Court. So there must be a clear separation of powers. We cannot allow the lady, no matter how much she thinks she is intelligent to get into issues that is [sic] not hers."He added that they were not concerned with the content of the report, but the author of the report, slamming Madonsela while also claiming it was written by private auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.When pressed by the media, Mkhize read parts of the report from his mobile phone to prove that they had read through the entire report.'I don't know her name as well'DOWNLOAD the full State of Capture report hereMaine said Madonsela was nothing more than a puppet of the Democratic Alliance using her report to launch the party's 2019 election campaign and to bring Zuma down.Maine said "drama queen" Madonsela must now rest."We're calling for lady to rest in peace... it's like she is still the Public Protector."It's like she is not finished with what her handlers would have wanted her to finish, she must rest in peace and allow the new PP to do her work," Maine said.Maine also hit out at Madonsela for referring to him as "Oros" - a name some opposition parties call him."She said she does not know my name and referred to me as Oros, so I don't know her name as well. Others are calling her a spy or big nose, I don't know her name," Maine said.He defended Eskom boss Brian Molefe as an example of black excellence fighting against white monopoly capital.WATCH this video:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
