Jenni Evans, News24Cape Town -&nbsp;Fidel Castro spared no effort to help black people take their rightful place in society, Azapo said on Saturday."Indeed, President Castro spared no effort or resource in his quest to create the conditions for Black people, the poor and the working class to take their rightful places in society at all levels, in Cuba and throughout the world," said Azanian Peoples Organisation president Prof Itumeleng Mosala. Castro died on Friday at the age of 90. Mosala said Castro's deep commitment to the freedom and well-being of oppressed and working people around the world endured throughout his life. Many countries owed their liberation to the support of Cuba, he continued, and South Africa still benefits from the Cuban doctors programme. "Today we mourn the passing of a great revolutionary. &nbsp;Today we remember Fidel Castro and dip our banners in solemn memory for his enormous contribution to humanity," Azapo said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
