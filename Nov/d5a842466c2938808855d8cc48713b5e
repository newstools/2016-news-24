He said a significant number of women and children were killed, without providing a precise toll.The interior ministry said 18 people were killed and another 43 wounded in the clashes, which happened in the western Tahoua region, adding that homes were also set on fire.It said in a statement that security forces had restored order and an investigation was under way, while calling for calm.The clashes come nearly two years after 10 people were killed in the same region in similar clashes between cattle herders and farmers.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
