The State Council says coal consumption must be capped at about 4.2 billion tons in 2020 while non-fossil fuel energy generation capacity like hydro-power and nuclear power are expanded. The plan was announced on Friday, the same day as the Paris Agreement of nearly 200 countries took effect. China has taken a leading role in climate change talks and its collaboration with the United States has been touted by Washington and Beijing as a bright spot in an otherwise strained relationship. China will guarantee that emissions peak no later than 2030 under the Paris pact. There are also plans to officially launch a national carbon trading market next year. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
