Valene.GovenderTHE eThekwini Municipality is urging the public to be aware of planned maintenance on the Midmar Treatment Works from 8am on Tuesday, 22 November to 2pm on Wednesday, 23 November. This totals 30 hours for the planned maintenance to be undertaken.Affected areas are those serviced by the Midmar Dam and include the Outer West, Inner West and parts of the South.Head of Communications, Tozi Mthethwa said: Residents are urged not to increase demand on the system by storing water. Water will be available to residents from reservoirs. However, the public is urged to not stockpile water as it will put the reservoir system under strain. If there is a demand on the reservoir system it will lead to the reservoirs being drained and residents being without water. The public is therefore urged to use water conservatively. If the planned maintenance does not go ahead, this will be communicated to the public. The maintenance will be deferred to a later date if officials are unhappy with the water levels in reservoirs. These levels have to be at 80 percent or above for the planned maintenance to go ahead, he added. - Supplied.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
