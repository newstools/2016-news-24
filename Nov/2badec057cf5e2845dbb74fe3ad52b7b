Others, however, did not find Kenyatta's utterance funny, with some even blasting what they termed his "insensitivity" towards people who have lost loved ones due to political violence.At least three African countries, South Africa, Burundi and the Gambia were set to quit the Hague-based court.The ICC has since pleaded with the defectors and other African countries considering leavening the court "not to leave".&nbsp;In a case that was reportedly riddled with political interference, Kenyatta together with his deputy William Ruto were acquitted on charges over post-election violence that took place in 2007 in which more than 1 000 people were killed.Kenyatta's alleged crimes against humanity&nbsp;were dropped late in 2014 on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to take him to trial.His deputy was discharged early this after the ICC&nbsp;also cited lack of evidence.&nbsp;Ruto had been charged alongside broadcaster Joshua Sang with murder, deportation and persecution for their alleged leading roles in the violence.The Kenyan president is 'tempted' to ask the International Criminal Court to look into US 'post-election violence' pic.twitter.com/xqmOS97keT&mdash; Larry Madowo (@LarryMadowo) November 21, 2016The Kenyan president is 'tempted' to ask the International Criminal Court to look into US 'post-election violence' pic.twitter.com/xqmOS97keTICC now a joke https://t.co/0TudMjKJLZ&mdash; Tomi Oladipo (@Tomi_Oladipo) November 21, 2016ICC now a joke https://t.co/0TudMjKJLZ@LarryMadowo Was it meant to be funny? 1,800 dead, hundreds of thousands displaced, it's become a joke???&mdash; Dr.Oduwo, Noah Akala (@OduwoNoahAkala) November 21, 2016@LarryMadowo Was it meant to be funny? 1,800 dead, hundreds of thousands displaced, it's become a joke???@Evansmosongo @LarryMadowo I wonder if you would find it funny if you lost family or friends during the post-election violence.&mdash; P.
