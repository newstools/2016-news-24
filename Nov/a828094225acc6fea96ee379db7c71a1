They would also be allowed to make nominations."Out of that process, we will have the IEC [Electoral Commission of South Africa], who will be processing that at the time."Magaxa said he and Fransman were clear about the acting chairperson's position."I availed myself for a deputy chairperson position, and I think I remain in that position until the conference of the ANC. I am not a material for a chairperson in the Western Cape. I can be a chairperson in Limpopo or somewhere else. But in the Western Cape, I believe strongly I am not the material for that," he said.The ANC said on November 10 that Fransman's membership had been suspended for five years.He was found guilty on two counts of misconduct related to his "abusing his office for the purpose of attempting to obtain a sexual favour from Louisa Wynand, and for making public statements which brought the ANC into disrepute". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
