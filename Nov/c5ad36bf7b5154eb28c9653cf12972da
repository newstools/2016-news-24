She said she was not shocked by the move, saying she "saw it coming".&nbsp;Mentor stunned the country when she said on Facebook in March that the Guptas offered her the job of public enterprises minister when Barbara Hogan was sacked in 2010. This happened at the Guptas' home in Saxonwold, Johannesburg, while Zuma was in the house. In return they wanted her to drop SAA's route to India and give it to them.One of the Gupta brothers allegedly offered her the job, while President Jacob Zuma was in the house.He helped her down the stairs afterwards, she claimed, but Zuma denied any knowledge of her.Speaking on the sidelines of the Cape Town leg of the #SaveSouthAfrica march to the National Prosecuting Authority's office, she called on other ANC members to stand up and be counted to prove that there are other good members like her who are fed up with corruption.Meanwhile, during the demonstration a fellow marcher tapped her on the arm and said, "Ms Mentor, good luck and thank you."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
