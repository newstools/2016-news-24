"There will be a chance for more thorough readings."Sisi, the former defence minister who was elected after leading the military ouster of Islamist president Mohammed Morsi, has painted himself as a regional leader in the fight against Islamic militancy, a stance that echoes Trump's priorities.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
