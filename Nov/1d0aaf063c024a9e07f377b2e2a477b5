Fransman has 21 days to appeal the decision after the party's disciplinary committee found him guilty on November 10 of two counts of misconduct and suspended him from the party for five years. "I will be appealing. [I] still have two weeks left according to the Constitution," he said.&nbsp; He said ANC leaders should focus on the work of the organisation, and not him. "Our people need us and that is our focus," he told News24.Fransman defence 'counterrevolutionary'The ANC on Tuesday held a press conference where it condemned Fransman's public statements following his suspension. They called for Fransman to take responsibility for his actions. Acting chairperson Khaya Magaxa said Fransman could not be a referee and a player in the same situation and needed to respect the party processes. They had supported Fransman during the disciplinary process and would continue to support him should he appeal, Magaxa said. But his conduct was now aggravating matters, the party said. The party also condemned the Congress of South African Students who had "occupied" the ANC's provincial headquarters on Friday in defence of Fransman. Their actions were counterrevolutionary, Magaxa said, and amounted to serious provocation.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
