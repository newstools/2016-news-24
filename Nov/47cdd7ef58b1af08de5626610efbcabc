An NPA official,&nbsp;without going into detail,&nbsp;confirmed to News24 on Monday that the deadline had been met. The three were requested to make submissions after the NPA laid charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, along with former senior South African Revenue Service officials Oupa Magashula and Ivan Pillay. The charges were later withdrawn. Meanwhile, the DA believes the submissions made to Zuma should be made public. DA MP Glynnis Breytenbach said the public deserved to know the facts surrounding the spectacle of Gordhan&rsquo;s prosecution and subsequent withdrawal of charges. "It is therefore of national importance that the President handles the rest of the process with complete transparency, in doing so placing himself above suspicion." Last week, Zuma scored a victory when an urgent application for Abrahams&rsquo; dismissal, by Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation, was struck off the roll.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
