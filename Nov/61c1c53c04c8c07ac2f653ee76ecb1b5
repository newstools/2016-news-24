They have been eating what their mothers are eating. We are operating at zero budget from the treasury," Banda was quoted as saying.The ZPCS accommodated around 100 babies born at different prison facilities across the country.&nbsp;Banda said that the prison facilities in the capital Harare also lacked other basic necessities such as ambulances, blankets and transport to ferry prisoners to appear at their various court cases. According to reports, Zimbabwe, which has been been ruled by long-time leader Robert Mugabe since 1980, last year had a prison population of about 20 000.However, about six months ago the southern African country pardoned 2 000 prisoners to make space in its overcrowded jails. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
