Pityana is one of the organisation&rsquo;s founders."We&rsquo;ve written to the president, we have asked for a meeting with him, we&rsquo;ve told him that we believe that he is no longer worthy to lead this country."It is not possible for a leader to sit with a finding of the Constitutional Court that is so damning about his leadership and about his allowing... state resources to be used for his personal gain, for the benefit of his family and breaching the oath of office," Pityana said.He said, despite all this, Zuma was continuing to run the country as though nothing had happened. This was why the country was gradually falling into a situation where the topic of state capture was on the top of everyone&rsquo;s mind."It is going to happen: At the heart of the problem, you have a leader without integrity, who is without honour, who is not committed in serving the interests of this country."We have asked the president that we should have that discussion, and we believe that as citizens of this country, he should hear us and explain to us why he shouldn&rsquo;t resign."WATCH this video:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
