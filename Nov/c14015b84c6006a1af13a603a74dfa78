THE SPCA confirmed that dog theft is on the increase in our area. “We have had reports of little children stealing dogs to sell for R50, while Pitbull and Staffi-type dogs are stolen for dog-fighting rings as there is big money involved,” said Amanzimtoti SPCA general manager, Tracey Girling. Girling appealed to the public to get their dogs sterilised, because sterilised dogs are not used by the dog-fighting rings. “Micro-chipping is also vital to reunite dogs with their owners,” Girling stated.
