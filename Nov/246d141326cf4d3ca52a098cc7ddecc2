South Africa does not recognise this as a valid passport. Mos Def was expected to appear in the Bellville Magistrate's Court for this matter on Friday.But Tuesday's announcements by the home affairs department changed this.The department said it received a written apology from Mos Def for contravening the provisions of the Immigration Act of 2002, as well as the South African Passports and Travel Documents Act of 1994.&ldquo;Mr Smith Bey has unreservedly apologised to the government of South Africa and more particularly to the Department of Home Affairs for his actions and for any inconvenience and/or prejudice this may have caused.&ldquo;The department is satisfied with the apology, and has agreed in principle for him to depart from South Africa on Tuesday."Both parties came to the agreement that if Mos Def left South Africa immediately on Tuesday, on a valid US passport, the department would withdraw its charges against him.&ldquo;To this end, (he) has applied for and will be travelling out of the republic on a US passport,&rdquo; it said.The charges would be withdrawn in Mos Def's absence on Friday, it added.DHA has accepted the apology of #MosDef &amp; has agreed in principle for him to depart from SA on 22 Nov 16 pic.twitter.com/PVILVh594k&mdash; HomeAffairsSA (@HomeAffairsSA) November 22, 2016#statement on #MosDef pic.twitter.com/2Ho4KgQNd9&mdash; HomeAffairsSA (@HomeAffairsSA) November 22, 2016DHA has accepted the apology of #MosDef &amp; has agreed in principle for him to depart from SA on 22 Nov 16 pic.twitter.com/PVILVh594k#statement on #MosDef pic.twitter.com/2Ho4KgQNd924.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
