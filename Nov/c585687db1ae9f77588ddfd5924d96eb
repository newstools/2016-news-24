Treasury must give funding for a judge to appoint a team to assist in an inquiry.&rdquo;Van der Merwe added that he was concerned with timeframes, saying it took Madonsela seven months to compile her report. He said this would however not concern the Gupta family.&ldquo;We will participate and do so comprehensively.&rdquo;Van der Merwe said that as far he was aware, the Gupta family was in the country and that they had read the report until the late evening on Wednesday.&ldquo;We will prepare for the allegations and that is what we concentrate on. The family are not implicated in any wrongdoing. The report says allegations of wrongdoing [should] be investigated.&rdquo;Van der Merwe said a judge would have to investigate any allegations.&ldquo;We want an opportunity to put our version through. I am working through the report and making notes on issues that may raise questions. I will prepare our documents, witnesses and versions going forward.&rdquo;He concluded the interview saying the report did not require the Gupta family &ldquo;to do anything until a judge calls on us to participate in any inquiry&rdquo;.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
