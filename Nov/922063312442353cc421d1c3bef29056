After that they went to the room Siyoni was being held in, and where he subsequently made the confession, said the officer.Mayi denied any allegations that he had tortured Siyoni and forced the man to sign an affidavit, effectively putting words into his mouth."He was never assaulted. Never did I wipe blood off Siyoni, because there was no blood," said Mayi.The money could either have been payment for the alleged hit, or it could have been meant for gym weights Siyoni was buying through Sizwezakhe Vumazonke, the alleged hitman who died in September, depending on which version Judge Dayalin Chetty accepts.PerjuryBreakfast and Siyoni have been declared hostile witnesses, after distancing themselves from the contents of the affidavits that were supposed to be used against the accused.Breakfast has been charged with perjury and defeating the ends of justice and on Monday Siyoni was dismissed from the stand after refusing to answer a single question.Panayiotou, Sinethemba Nenembe and Zolani Sibeko are on trial on charges of conspiring, kidnapping, robbing and killing Jayde.Her body was found on April 22 in a field in KwaNobuhle and, in a shock twist, Panayiotou was arrested, charged with plotting the murder.The accused have pleaded not guilty.Court started late on Monday because one of the accused, Nenembe, had to make a quick appearance for another murder case.In that case, one of the accused is thought to be the cousin of Vumazonke.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
