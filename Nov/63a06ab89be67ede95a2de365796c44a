The militants then dynamited a barge, which sank on Tuesday.It belonged to a contractor repairing damage from a bombing last week that cut supplies to Dutch-British multinational Shell's 400 000-barrel-a-day Forcados export terminal.Ogugu said the dynamite remains on the same pipeline in the southern Niger Delta.Last week's attack came hours after President Muhammadu Buhari held inconclusive talks with stakeholders to halt the militancy whose sabotage has thrown the oil-dependent West African nation into recession.The militants want a bigger share of oil revenues.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
