He left Pretoria on Tuesday. "The Presidency, on enquiry, has been informed that police were investigating a case involving the knocking [down] of a pedestrian by a car driven by a police officer in Pretoria."A family member of Moutlana's, Mpho Moutlana, confirmed his death on Twitter on Saturday night in reaction to Mashaba's tweet.Ngqulunga said the police would be better placed to provide clarity on the matter. "The Presidency extends heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased on this tragic loss. The Presidency remains ready to assist the Mayor of Johannesburg in future with clarity on matters affecting the Presidency to ensure the accuracy of information being disseminated."
