Valene.GovenderDID you know that as little as 30cm of water can float your car?Drivers often underestimate the dangers of flooding, especially at low-lying bridges, where as little as 30 centimetres of water can float vehicles or result in the driver losing control.Many areas have been affected by floods recently and Amanzimtoti was one of them.Local police have released the following tips that might save your life in heavy rain: do not attempt to drive through flooded areas, even if the water looks shallow enough to cross; leave your vehicle if it stalls and move immediately to higher ground; never drive into water that covers the road, you do not know how deep it is or whether the road underneath has been washed away; be on special alert near dips in the highway and near low-lying bridges; exercise caution, especially at night when visibility is poor; pedestrians must avoid areas where water is flowing rapidly; and keep children away from playing in drainage ditches or storm water drains or areas where water is easily accumulated. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
