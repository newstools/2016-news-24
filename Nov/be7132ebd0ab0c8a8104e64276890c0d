Candyce.Krishna PLANS to rob an ATM in Hibberdene were botched as SAPS members stopped a group of robbers in their tracks on Tuesday morning. One of the men were arrested while the others fled. “At approximately 1.30am two members from Hibberdene police were on their way from a complaint on the R102 Sipofu road, when they received a complaint about an alarm that was activated at an ATM nearby,” said police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Zandra Wiid. “They responded, just in time to see three vehicles leaving, and requested back-up,” said Wiid. Members from Port Shepstone Tactical Response Team (TRT), who were close by, reacted and followed one of the vehicles [white Nissan] onto the N2 freeway north-bound. Once the driver of the vehicle saw he was being followed, shots were fired at the police. The police returned fire and subsequently the white Nissan was forced to stop. “Some suspects fled on foot, but one man was arrested. A Z88 pistol, balaclavas, angle grinders and gloves were found in the vehicle. No one was injured,” said Wiid. Due to the quick response of the Hibberdene police and the TRT members, the suspects abandoned their plans to cut open the ATM and tried to evade the police. “The suspect could face charges of attempted business robbery and attempted murder,” added Wiid. Acting cluster commander of Ugu Cluster, Brigadier Bongani Sibiya, was delighted with the swift response by police members and the successful arrest of one suspect. - Supplied.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
