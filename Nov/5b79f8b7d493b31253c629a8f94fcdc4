Cape Town - A Zimbabwean man, who fatally stabbed his wife after mistaking her for a goblin, has reportedly been acquitted after the high court found that he was mentally disabled.&nbsp;The incident happened in August last year.&nbsp;According to the state-owned Chronicle&nbsp;newspaper, Makiana Sandako of Petronella ranch in Masvingo stabbed his wife Chiedza Regerai to death after mistaking her for a goblin that had been punching him during the night. Passing down judgement, Masvingo high court judge justice Joseph Mafusire said that the accused was temporarily insane at the time he committed the crime.A&nbsp;New Zimbabwe.com&nbsp;report said that&nbsp;Sandako stabbed his wife twice above her breast and several times on the neck using a chisel.The court further heard that after stabbing his wife, Sandako stabbed himself once on the neck before shouting for help. &nbsp;Evidence presented before the court showed that he had once sought help from traditional healers over his hallucinations at night.Mafusire said that &nbsp;Sandako must be kept at the Chikurubi maximum prison's mental health facility until the doctors certified him fit to go back into society. "The court has proven beyond any reasonable doubt that the accused was mentally challenged at the material time he murdered his wife. The defence deserves the benefit of doubt on this matter. The court does not deny that the accused did not know the nature and quality of the act. This also means he did not realise that the act was wrong," Mafusire was quoted as saying. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
