In an effort to reduce crime, the Green Point City Improvement District (GPCID) has installed more cameras in the area.The cameras were installed after Patrick Pollacchi, owner of Sound Events, approached the GPCID and offered to pay for the system.It has a live feed and allows the GPCID control over the zoom and direction the cameras are facing. Only a month after the installation, the improvement district has already averted five crimes and made two arrests through the cameras, say Marius Swanepoel, GPCID security manager.The cameras provide a way to prevent crimes before they happen, explains Swanepoel, as having an eye on the ground allows a faster response.Swanepoel adds: Our mission is to stop the crime before it becomes a statistic. Our vehicles are constantly patrolling the area and can respond quickly. The cameras also allow the GPCID to monitor hotspots for crimes such as snatch and grabs and keep track of trends in criminal activity in the area. It s great to have the peace of mind that the area is under 24/7 surveillance, and that it s helping we have already prevented numerous car break-ins, says Pollacchi.All the cameras will have full-colour images to improve details for investigations. Using facial recognition software is also being looked into. The GPCID is committed to the protection and upliftment of Green Point, and this camera system is just one of the efforts being made to ensure this goal is reached, says GPCID chief executive Marc Truss. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
