Our history is falsified, it was written on demand," he said.This testimony must "remain for our children, for our generation, for researchers who want to know the truth," said Laabidi, who was arrested and tortured for his militancy under Ben Ali.The next hearing date is scheduled for December 17 - six years to the day since street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire, prompting mass protests that exploded into the Arab Spring.The last broadcast will be on January 14, the anniversary of Ben Ali's final flight from the country he dominated for more than two decades.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
