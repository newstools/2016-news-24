With the line-up already confirmed and the venue booked, it is all systems go for the first event. Guests can expect to see six acts, with five of the performers born and bred in Mitchell&rsquo;s Plain. Marc Lottering, Kenwyn Davids, Mel Jones, Kurt Schoonraad, Justin Stoffels, known by his stage name as Justin Ray, and Lunga Tshuka will take the stage and keep the audience entertained with material created for the community and inspired by the community. People&rsquo;s Post is the official print media partner to the event. Taking place at Spine Road High School on Thursday 15 December from 20:00 to late, guests can look forward to great comedic talent for one night only, all on one stage. The content will be relatable and based on concepts that hit home with residents. Davids, the event organiser, says the planning for the event started earlier this year. &ldquo;There are many guys who come from Mitchell&rsquo;s Plain who are doing well in comedy and who should be known by the community,&rdquo; says Davids. Four of the comedians still live in the area. The artists have all had major successes on the comedy scene with performances at the Baxter and on Comedy Central to name two. The show will seat 1100 people. Tickets are available at Computicket for R150 each. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
