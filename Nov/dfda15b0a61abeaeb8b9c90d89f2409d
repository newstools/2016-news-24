She mentioned that she didn't sell more than 10 ice lollies that day so there was no way it could have been her ice that caused the pupils to vomit," Zwane said.'Unfounded conclusions'Parents were up in arms and said the woman needed to be chased away."The lady should be kicked out of the school premises as a hawker. This time our kids might have gotten off lightly by a mere vomit but what might happen next time if the school board decides to keep her," said one parent who refused to give her name.However, Zwane warned against prejudging the situation."We must shy away from making unfounded conclusions and a proper investigation will be carried [out] to find out what caused the vomiting. After that the school will make a decision. The majority of the pupils were discharged and none have been admitted."He said the cause had not been proven."The cause might not be the ice lollies but something else they have eaten during the day," Zwane said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
