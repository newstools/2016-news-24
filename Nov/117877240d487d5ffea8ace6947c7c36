Kaveel Singh, News24 Durban – eThekwini metro police are investigating a video that shows one of their officers allegedly attempting to perform "doughnuts" in an official vehicle, a spokesperson said on Tuesday. In the video the driver of a metro police vehicle is seen at an intersection attempting to "do doughnuts", as the stunt is called in car spinning and drifting circles. The point of the stunt is to spin the tyres of a vehicle while manoeuvring it in circles. Screeching its tyres, the vehicle in the video circles twice and drives away from the intersection. "The department is aware of the incident and the matter is under internal disciplinary investigation," metro police spokesperson Sibonelo Mchunu told News24. When asked for details of the case, Mchunu said it was against metro police policy to divulge the details of the case at this point. "The person who is being investigated will have to plead and state his case. The matter becomes sort of sub judice. Once the processes are finalised we will inform you guys of what is the outcome." Without specifying when, Mchunu said the matter would be resolved soon. WATCH the video:    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
