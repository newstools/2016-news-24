"She explained that some individuals engaged with her more effectively than others, and while some were extremely helpful and sensitive to her needs, others had not been equally responsive to her situation," he said."This suggests that it may be that particular processes and procedures of the university have not been fully complied with by certain individuals in these circumstances."The student felt that a considered conversation about issues related to rape, sexual harassment and gender based harm in residences is urgently needed in all universities and in society as a whole, Habib said.He appealed to those commenting on the issue on social media to engage "in a way that is truthful, measured and engaged, and in a way that does not contribute to the distress of the complainant and her family"."We must be protective and sensitive of her personal circumstances at all times," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
