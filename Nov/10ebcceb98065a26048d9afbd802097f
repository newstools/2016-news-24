The opposition has accused Kabila, who has been in office since 2001, of manipulating the electoral system to stay in power after his second term ends on December 20. The decision to delay the vote was taken in October by the government and fringe opposition groups following a "national dialogue" - boycotted as a sham by much of the opposition - aimed at calming soaring political tensions.Kabila will address the nation on Tuesday when he speaks to parliament. A UN Security Council delegation in the country has called for a peaceful transition of power following the government's decision to delay elections.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
