It cited systematic arrests, summary and extrajudicial executions and torture. The groups also said soldiers from the former Tutsi-dominated army are being purged and dozens have been murdered, arrested or transferred.Senior officials also "increasingly and brazenly denounce 'Tutsis' as enemies of the regime," they said.FIDH released a circular from Burundi's Senate requiring every government office and public enterprise to classify employees by ethnicity - Tutsi, Hutu or Twa - saying this was to conform with the agreement that ended the civil war.The rights group said such ethnic classification isn't required under the accord.In the 1994 Rwanda genocide, more than 500 000 minority Tutsis and moderate members of the Hutu majority were killed by Hutu extremists.It ended after Tutsi-led rebels ousted the extremist Hutu government that orchestrated the killings.Rwanda's government remains Tutsi-led.This year, Burundi has refused to allow the African Union to send 5 000 peacekeepers and the United Nations to deploy 228 international police.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
