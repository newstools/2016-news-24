He also asked for reasons for the three not to face an inquiry into their fitness to hold office.The trio are in the possible firing line for their handling of the fraud charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.Abrahams said he dropped the charges against the finance minister after he came across new evidence in the matter during representations by former Sars boss Oupa Magashula and senior executive Ivan Pillay who faced a similar charge.Abrahams issued them with a summons for approving an early retirement payout for Pillay. He was later rehired on contract.HSF and FUL had said Abrahams was not fit to hold office, asserting that the charges brought against Gordhan, Magashula and Pillay were baseless."On face value we welcome the news, there seems to be some movement but one cannot count their chickens before they hatch," said FUL's chairperson Judge Johann Kriegler in response to the president's letter to Abrahams.He said a decision on what to do would be made after a meeting with lawyers."One must be very cautious and think very carefully in such a matter," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
