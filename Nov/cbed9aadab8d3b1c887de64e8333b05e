Speaking in the National Assembly, Mudarikwa said that although the Chinese farm owners were farming on a large scale in the country, this was one of their ways of disguising illegal mining of the country's natural resources.

One would like to know where the gold and platinum is going when people move in on ten year leases pretending that they are there to farm. These Chinese are very good in saying that you must not trespass into the area where they are farming," Mudarikwa was quoted as saying.
