The High Court also permitted opposition parties who had applied to oppose the president's application to join in the matter.The president's legal team is expected to argue why the report should not be published.Jacob Zuma had maintained that he did not have sufficient time to respond to questions posed by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela on his relationship with the Gupta family. Madonsela was investigating claims of undue influence by the family over Zuma.The president's counsel Anthea Platt had already told the court that the president had found Madonsela's report to be procedurally flawed as the former Public Protector did not afford him the opportunity to respond to questions and quiz witnesses before the finalisation of the report.He wants the court to declare it unlawful.Former ANC member of Parliament Vytjie Mentor and Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas have made allegations against the family that they offered them ministerial positions.'You think you are angry now, wait until tomorrow'The EFF's Julius Malema also told journalists at a media briefing in October that he gave evidence to Madonsela on the matter.Malema and James Selfe of the DA were among many politicians who sat through some of the proceedings on day one and both expressed confidence in the legal counsels representing opposition parties and the courts.They also said they felt the matter was already going against the president, who abandoned his bid to get the matter postponed after Van Rooyen's application was struck off the roll."It was a smoke screen just there to assist the president," Selfe told reporters.Malema said attempts by the president to amend an earlier affidavit were to just push for another postponement."He is a thug, a criminal. When he says he wants to make an amendment, when he does so knowing by law the other side will ask for more time so it can reply; he gets a postponement through the back door. We are not going to allow that," he told EFF supporters.Malema, who told supporters he expected a decision by the court in favour of the report being released, said the contents of it will leave the nation reeling."You'll get the shock of your lives when that report is released. You think you are angry now, wait until tomorrow," he said on Tuesday evening.The party, along with the DA and civic group Save South Africa, will be among those marching in the Pretoria city centre on Wednesday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
