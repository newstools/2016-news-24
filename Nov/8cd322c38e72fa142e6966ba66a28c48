I do not have words to describe how I feel. No one will understand my pain. The legal system failed Poppie. The SAPS just listened to the claims made by Louisa [Poppie's mother] and never allowed me to give my side of the story." &nbsp;Koekemoer appeared briefly in court on Friday.Unlike Thursday, when he was wearing the clothes he&rsquo;d had on during his first appearance in November, this time Koekemoer had on a black suit and tie.&nbsp;His lawyer asked in the packed court room that the case be postponed until November 28, when the suspect will formally apply for bail.The request was granted.&nbsp;Van der Merwe sat between a group of women wearing pink, who were protesting against Koekemoer.&nbsp;Van der Merwe also wore a pink T-shirt, with Poppie&rsquo;s face on the back. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
