Later a group of people, including residents and the puppy's new owner, used spades to make the hole even bigger.&nbsp;Heidi Pfeifer, whose sister Inge Taylor stays in the complex, has taken Xena in.&nbsp;Saved from neglectPfeifer says other residents rescued Xena and possibly two of her siblings from a neglectful owner."The woman took the three dogs for a walk on Sunday when Xena fell into the hole."Pfeifer's sister had called her because she is a snake catcher and might have had the necessary equipment to get the trapped puppy out."Due to the bends in the pipes, it wasn't possible."Pfeifer says the SPCA and the fire brigade also made attempts to save the puppy on Sunday, but there was little they could do.Tania Adendorf, who'd been at school with Pfeifer, says she just had to help after seeing a Facebook post about the puppy.&nbsp;Adendorf belongs to a prayer group.&nbsp;'Power of prayer'They prayed for Xena's rescue while she [Adendorf] sat speaking to the dog in an attempt to coax her out.&nbsp;"However, the Lord told us that we had to move away from the hole because our presence was scaring her."As soon as they did, that Xena came reversing out of the hole, said Adendorf.&nbsp;"People started shouting: 'Grab her bum'. The power of prayer is unbelievable." &nbsp;Pfeifer took Xena to a vet."The vet couldn't believe that the puppy had been stuck in a hole for 33 hours." &nbsp;The dog is OK now, she said."She wasn't dehydrated that badly. She's been vaccinated, ate and fell asleep next to a hot water bottle."&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
