The rest died, Gusdian told reporters.Only 12 passengers have been formally identified, he added. Among the dead were two young girls.Police said the passengers were likely illegal Indonesian migrant workers returning from jobs in Malaysia, and the boat was over capacity at the time of the accident.One of the crew members managed to survive and was being questioned by police, Gusdian said.The Indonesian archipelago of more than 17 000 islands is heavily dependent on boat transport, but safety standards are lax and fatal accidents common.More than 60 people died in December when huge waves capsized a ferry charting a course through Sulawesi province. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
