The popular show, Jeff Koinange Live (JKL) on Wednesday hosted Nairobi Gubernatorial aspirants Esther Passaris and Miguna Miguna. While on set, Miguna made slandering rape comments towards Passaris."You are so beautiful; everybody wants to rape Pasaris," Advocate Miguna was quoted as saying. &nbsp;Miguna also made disparaging comments about Passaris' looks, and openly mocked her: "A woman who has absolutely no integrity. A socialite bimbo whose only claim to fame is because she is looking for billionaire sponsors [sugar daddies].&rdquo;Koinange was widely criticised by many, including a rights group, Human Rights Watch (HRW) for sitting idly while Miguna persisted in his slanderous comments.HRW said that "trivialising sexual abuse" was "no entertainment".&nbsp;Following the controversial episode of his show, Koinange, according to Nairobi News, announced his departure, while also apologising to all Kenyans who were offended by the incident."About a week ago right here on JKL we had a programme that deteriorated into something extremely ugly&hellip; where two guests went at each other and then some people out there who probably thought I should have done a better job in controlling the guests and I agree looking back hindsight is always 20/20... but in a live TV programme its always difficult&hellip; but I agree am man enough to man up to that."And if there is anyone who felt aggrieved by the show&hellip; anyone who felt I didn't do a good job&hellip; I apologise so that we can move on. It was&nbsp;regrettable&nbsp;in most parts but again it was one show out of 300 we have done on KTN," Koinange was quoted as saying.He also tweeted:THANK YOU KENYA!! 300 Episodes!! 10 MILLION Viewers Every Episode!!
