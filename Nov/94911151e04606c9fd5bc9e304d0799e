The country has endured months of shortages of products ranging from sugar to baby formula.Cairo governments had avoided the measures fearing unrest, but President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi says Egypt no longer has the luxury of postponing them.The November 3 move came amid a dollar crunch that led to a thriving black market and a slump in imports, and caused the pound to plunge to about 16 to the US dollar from 8.9.The government also announced a 7% salary increase for civil servants, who number about six million out of a total population of more than 90 million.Lagarde said in a statement that the moves, which also include cutting fuel subsidies, "will notably improve Egypt's external competitiveness, address shortages of foreign currency, support exports and tourism and help attract foreign investment".The program aims "to put the country's economy on a sustainable path and achieve job-rich growth," she said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
