Even senior counsel don't go anywhere close to him. Education will demonstrate black excellence," he told reporters outside the High Court in Pretoria.He was referring to advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, who argued for the party's application to oppose President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s bid to interdict the release of former public protector Thuli Madonsela&rsquo;s &ldquo;state capture&rdquo; report.A full bench of the court later ruled in favour of opposition parties' intervention.Malema referred to Co-operative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen&rsquo;s lawyer, Stephan du Toit, as &ldquo;an old white man who doesn't say anything&rdquo;.Du Toit argued for an urgent application to interdict the release of the report. The court struck down the application.Malema said the EFF would march through the streets of Pretoria to call for Zuma to step down, and for free quality education.He urged parents to take the lead in the march to support the students&rsquo; movement."The demand for free education is a genuine demand. As parents we must not complain when the children are protesting. Children are fighting for their parents. Parents must stop being cowards. We must come and occupy Pretoria and demand quality free education."There is no memorandum. There is no plan where to go. We are just marching and demonstrating our commitment for Zuma to resign."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
