When I got there, he was barely conscious."The uniforms of Mountview pupils who tried to help him were covered in his blood.Shirlane flagged down a vehicle transporting children and it rushed her and her brother to a nearby day hospital."He didn&rsquo;t say much, just that I must put pressure on the wound. He didn&rsquo;t look good," she said.Corinne said after he had been stabilised, Justin called her and told her who had stabbed him."He squeezed my hand, but kept complaining how cold he was. We waited for hours for an ambulance to arrive. By 17:00, we were still waiting."When the ambulance arrived, it was decided that he was too weak to be driven to Groote Schuur Hospital, the family said.But the department of health emergency medical and forensic pathology services spokesperson Robert Daniels said emergency services was informed of the incident at 14:07 and paramedics - who are dispatched depending on the severity of the case - arrived at 14:51.He said the department's records show that the ambulance arrived at 15:15, but the patient was found to be too unstable to transport and his blood pressure was too low.Corinne insisted they were told that the ambulance had been waiting for a police escort, as emergency workers refuse to enter gang-ridden communities out of fear for their safety.The mother of six lost her 22-year-old son two years ago. He was gunned down outside their Groenpoort Walk home. His murder has not yet been solved. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
