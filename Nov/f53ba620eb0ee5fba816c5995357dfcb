She said she was the only one on duty. They then bound her hands using electric cord and dumped her in the back of a vehicle. The two, plus another seven, then broke into the building. Using an angle grinder they opened the safe and grabbed vehicle keys and cash.Taking their time, the gang members ripped out telephone lines, alarm wires and computer network cable, as well as stealing five computers.They found the keys to start six of the brand new vehicles in the showroom and drove off in three Hilux double cabs, two Fortuners and a Land Cruiser.None of the vehicles had registration plates.An unconfirmed report stated that the gang members were disturbed by something or someone, otherwise they would have taken more vehicles. Four of the vehicles were filled up with diesel at Daddy's Garage about midnight. The attendants on duty apparently did not query anything. The "drivers" evidently asked for information about how to get to Muden. A farm worker later found the GPS from one of the vehicles, which had been thrown out on the Muden-Greytown road.It is likely that the other two vehicles went out of town on the Kranskop road. An intensive search is being carried out by Pietermaritzburg SAPS to find the vehicles and thieves. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
