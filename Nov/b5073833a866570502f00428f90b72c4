He told News24 that he could not comment on the reasons for his suspension until a disciplinary hearing was conducted.&nbsp;Earlier on Wednesday a handful of people representing the editors' forum, the Communication Workers' Union, the Patriotic Alliance, Black First Land First, Cosatu and other unions protested at the Citizen newspaper's Johannesburg offices in support of Motale.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
