His complexion was exceptionally light when he was born on Erwee&rsquo;s farm in 1980.Lives turned upside downMolapisi and her son earlier told Netwerk24 that their lives were turned upside down after Erwee ordered them off the farm a month later.Molapisi claims that Erwee and his family visited her on the day of Mtheto&rsquo;s birth to see what the baby boy looked like."There was a huge fight at Erwee&rsquo;s house and I was later summoned to the house, where Erwee was waiting for me in the kitchen," she said earlier."He [Erwee] put R60 on the kitchen table, looked at me and then turned his back. He didn&rsquo;t say anything else. I knew I had to take my things and leave. I packed up everything that night and disappeared in the darkness with Mtheto while everyone was asleep."Molapisi alleges Erwee sent her husband to work on one of his other farms, and then raped her.After Mtheto&rsquo;s birth, she said she and her baby stayed with her parents on another farm in the area.Molapisi apparently gave her husband the assurance until his death in 2004 that he was Mtheto&rsquo;s dad.However, she decided to sue Erwee for maintenance after her husband died.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
