There has to be a change," he said. "This new cabinet is ready to respond and provide a better service with professionals from many directions."Nine of the previous 30-strong cabinet retained their posts, among them long-standing party loyalists Siraj Fegessa, in charge of defence, and Debretsion Gebremichael who runs telecommunication and information technology, as well as Hailemariam's deputy, Demeke Mekonnen.The new government, which includes just three women, was immediately approved by parliament in which every seat is held by Hailemariam's ruling coalition, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF).Until his dismissal, former government spokesman Getachew Reda had been considered a "rising star" within the EPRDF but was unpopular among the public.Hailemariam had promised the reshuffle would be based on skills rather than "party loyalty".Protesters in the central and western Oromo region and the northern Amhara region had denounced minority Tigrayan ethnic domination of the EPRDF, which has ruled Ethiopia for 25 years.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
