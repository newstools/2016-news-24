The metro might have to pay back consumers more than R9bn if Nersa or a court finds for the complainants.This is more than a third of Tshwane's budget. In June 2016, Tshwane had just R207m in the bank and the ANC had left the DA with a debt of R10bn, the maximum loan for a city, leaving the city's ability to afford the additional debt in doubt.Sources in the Gauteng provincial government told Times Live in September that they were convinced that Tshwane should be placed under administration.Paul Mashatile, MEC for co-operative governance, traditional affairs and human settlements, shortly afterwards appointed a task team to compile a report on Tshwane.&nbsp;Mogomotsi Mogodiri, Mashatile's spokesperson, confirmed to Rapport that the investigation had been completed and that Mashatile was considering all options, including putting Tshwane under administration, so that service delivery won't suffer.&nbsp;Re-election"The MEC is considering all its options. Before a city can be placed under administration, there are various legal aspects which have to be considered," said Mogodiri.Professor Bernard Bekink, of the department of public law at the University of Pretoria, said it was ironic that the ANC administration that was responsible for Tshwane's problems is now the one making complaints. However, to place the city under administration might not be a bad option. &nbsp;Bekink said it is not so easy to place a city under administration and certain steps have to be followed in terms of article 139 of the Constitution and the Municipal Finance Management Act (MFMA) to prove there is no financial liability or service delivery has failed completely.There are different levels of administration, but when a city is completely under administration, its debt is redeemed by Treasury and a re-election has to be held within 90 days."The DA can ask government for bridging capital," said Bekink."In the Constitution there are several options for when a city is placed under administration; it does not necessarily have to boil down to a re-election. I would, I would, for example, have stopped paying PEU some time ago. Let PEU take the matter to court."PetitionThe ANC's stubborn refusal to admit the PEU contract was a mistake and the DA's reluctance to consider a possible re-election might cause Tshwane's collapse, says Lex Middleberg, a former DA councillor who investigated the PEU abuses.According to him, the city's residents are set to suffer as a result of this because service delivery will deteriorate even more and the DA council will be forced to increase taxes.&nbsp;Middleberg says he intends starting a petition to have Tshwane placed under administration. &nbsp;Bekink warned that the government's three spheres: national, provincial and local, should prevent politicking from hampering service delivery if a metro is led by a party other than the governing party.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
