Lubala was the 16th journalist in 10 years to be slain in Democratic Republic of Congo, the UNPC president said.Tshilunde also said he was "deeply troubled" by the fact that the murder took place when "only the police carries out night patrols in the city of Mbuji-Mayi", capital of Eastern Kasai province.An overnight curfew was slapped on Mbuji-Mayi late September following fierce clashes between police and supporters of a local chief killed the previous month in the neighbouring province of Central Kasai.At least 100 people died in the clashes.A source close to the Eastern Kasai governor said a series of robberies had taken place during the curfew and that police could be behind the journalist's death.Early this month a local media rights group, Journalists In Danger (JED), noted in its annual report that targeted attacks against Congolese journalists were on the increase.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
