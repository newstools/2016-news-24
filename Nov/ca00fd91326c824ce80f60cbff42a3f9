In the beginning of the year when we were told that students were going to be financially excluded the SRC, led by Nguse, did nothing."SRC 'silent on issues'Wakeni said he did not recognise Nguse as the SRC president.Another student, Tabane Kupeng, said he would not be addressed by someone who had stolen money from students."I refuse to be addressed by him."Maqhawe Mawela said students were not happy with the current SRC leadership."The SRC has been there for a very long time but they have been silent on issues. They are working together with management to oppress students, even when the environment was not conducive enough for students to proceed with the academic programme, they emphasised that we go to university when there were bombs [at] the library."Mawela said students had been arrested and the SRC had not supported their plight.Political differences"It was alleged that he was working with the police to suppress the student movement. We cannot sit and listen to someone who wants votes from us but is not in the forefront of the students' struggle."Nguse, in response, said it was a matter of political differences."We are now going into the SRC elections and people will use any platform for their political gains. This just shows the political intolerance."Addressing the students earlier, Naidoo said she had been disappointed in the manner in which Higher Education and Training Minister Blade Nzimande had dealt with the demands of the Fees Must Fall movement."That he can stand there and say that he does not believe in decolonised education for all and that the rich should pay, is the most anti-socialist thing I have ever heard," she said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
