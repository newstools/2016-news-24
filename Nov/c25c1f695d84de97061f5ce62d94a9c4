The chase ended on the N3 near Paradise Valley, when Warrant Officer Mlu Khumalo, 52, put his service pistol in his mouth and pulled the trigger on Friday, Colonel Thulani Zwane said. Khumalo went on the run following the murder of another police officer and her friend at Unit BB, in Plessislaer, near Pietermaritzburg. Constable Phumzile Mgunge, who worked at the Pietermaritzburg police station, and her friend, Snenkosi Molefe, were shot dead on Thursday. Zwane said detectives believed the motive for the double slaying could have been a domestic dispute. Officers saw Khumalo driving on the N3 and tried to stop him. He fled, but then pulled over later. When police caught up with him, he had already shot himself. Damon Oliver, who drove past the scene, said: "When I went past, on the other side of the freeway, I could see the guy lying back in his seat with the door open and blood was pouring out." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
