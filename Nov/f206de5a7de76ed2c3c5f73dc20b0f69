Extensive damage by vandals on Saturday affected the safe operation of trains, resulting in a complete shutdown of the service on Sunday.By Monday morning, delays of up to an hour were experienced as repair work was carried out, while the afternoon service saw commuters wait more than two hours longer than usual.The vandalised equipment belongs to Neotel, is maintained by Transnet and is used by Metrorail.The shutdown allowed Transnet's technical teams to do the necessary repair work, while Metrorail employees worked alongside them to try and enable work to be completed as soon as possible.#Metrorail CT has introduced a "train shuttle" service while it continues to repair its vandalised equipment.
