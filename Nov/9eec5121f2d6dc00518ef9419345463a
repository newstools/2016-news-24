A salvage company had been appointed to remove all pollutants when it was safe enough to do so.&ldquo;All fuel on board must still be removed to prevent any pollution,&rdquo; Louw said.The fire broke out in the vessel last Wednesday while she was berthed at quay 703, sparking fears of a major pollution spill as clouds of smoke billowed across the harbour.On Saturday, she started listing due to all the water that had been sprayed into the hold. Firefighters were evacuated.The vessel had been carrying polystyrene and oil. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
