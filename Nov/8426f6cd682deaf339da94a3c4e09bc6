UN, EU and African Union officials were present.Tension between Puntland and Galmudug, which are semi-autonomous entities, flared in September after Galmudug said 13 of its troops had been killed in a US airstrike targeting Islamist fighters in the Shabaab group after Puntland - according to Galmudug - gave the Americans wrong intelligence.Clashes have since broken out in Galkayo, where rival clans vie for control.Puntland has accused Galmudug of attacking its forces in revenge for the US air strike. Galmudug says the fighting arose from a territorial dispute.In late September, the US military's Africa Command (Africom) said it had mounted an attack in self defence near Galkayo after Shabaab fighters attacked Somali government forces and their US advisors.Africom said nine "enemy combatants" had been killed.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
