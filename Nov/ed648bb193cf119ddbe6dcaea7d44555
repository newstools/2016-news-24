If this was the case, provisions of Section 195 of the Constitution would not have been complied with. This section deals with the basic principles and values governing public administration.As a result, there could have been violations of the executive ethics code.Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas alleged that the Guptas&rsquo; offering him the job of finance minister last year required him to extend favours to the family."There seems to be no evidence showing that Mr Jonas&rsquo; allegations that he was offered money and a ministerial post in exchange for favours were ever investigated by the executive," Madonsela said."Only the African National Congress and Parliament seemed to have considered this worthy of examination or scrutiny."She said failure to verify such an allegation may infringe the provisions of the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act.A similar duty was imposed and possibly violated in relation to the allegations by former GCIS head Themba Maseko, about his removal.Barbara Hogan&ldquo;The same too applies to persistent allegations regarding an alleged cosy relationship between Mr Brian Molefe and the Gupta family,&rdquo; she said, referring to the Eskom CEO.&ldquo;In this case it is worth noting that such allegations are backed by evidence and a source of concern that nothing seems to have been done regardless of the duty imposed by Section 195 of the Constitution on relevant State functionaries.&rdquo;She said the allegations made by former public enterprises minister Barbara Hogan also deserved a closer look. They suggested executive and party interference in the management of state-owned enterprises and linked appointments.Her main remedial action was that President Jacob Zuma should appoint a judicial commission of inquiry into state capture within 30 days.The commission had to present a report with findings and recommendations to Zuma within 180 days.Zuma had to submit a copy with an indication of his intentions regarding the implementation, to Parliament within 14 days of releasing the report.Madonsela&rsquo;s 355-page report was released on Wednesday afternoon.The full title is: &ldquo;State of Capture: Report on an investigation into alleged improper and unethical conduct by the President and other state functionaries relating to alleged improper relationships and involvement of the Gupta family in the removal and appointment of Ministers and Directors of State-Owned Enterprises resulting in improper and possibly corrupt award of state contracts and benefits to the Gupta family&rsquo;s businesses&rdquo;.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
