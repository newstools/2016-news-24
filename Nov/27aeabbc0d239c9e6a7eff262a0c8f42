The authorities originally arrested around 30 protesters, according to another opposition leader.The ministry of interior and public security had warned days earlier that the planned protest was banned.Opposition MPs had been seeking to hold the government of Prime Minister Albert Pahimi Padacke to account over its alleged mismanagement of the nation's economy.Like its neighbour, oil giant Nigeria, Chad is undergoing a severe financial crisis as a result of the slump in the price of crude.The opposition is also critical of the political situation under Deby's iron-fisted rule.A key ally of France in the regional fight against jihadists, Deby was swept back into power in April with 60 percent of votes. Kebzabo, his main rival, won just over 12 percent.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
