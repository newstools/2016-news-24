According to an Anglo American statement, to achieve the ISO 14001 standard, an accredited certification body must audit the organisation s system and certify that it is compliant. Bureau Veritas is currently the certification body used by Anglo American to certify all its operations.The process has placed a lot of emphasis on the organisation to show leadership commitment, understand and interpret the context within which they operate and better analyse the aspects posing risks to the business and the environment.Jaco Lambrechts, the Kolomela Mine s section manager: Environment, said the real work started with the training of all the relevant personnel on the ground. After several internal audits, the certification body did their assessment in June this year. After 11 minor issues were addressed, the final audit was conducted in August, Lambrechts said. This proves that we consistently manage our environmental impacts effectively and responsibly. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
