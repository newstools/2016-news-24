The elective conference is due in 2017.More Zuma supportersAnother NEC member who refused to divulge details confirmed that the meeting had to be extended because &ldquo;they could not finish the robust discussions&rdquo;.The NEC has until now failed to act against Zuma despite growing calls for him to step down from various sectors of society.It accepted his apology following the Constitutional Court ruling in March that he had failed to uphold the Constitution by not implementing former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela&rsquo;s remedial action to pay back some of the money spent on upgrades to his Nkandla home.The structure also decided to take collective responsibility, following a decline in electoral support during the local government elections, that saw the party lose key metros Johannesburg, Nelson Mandela Bay and Tshwane to the opposition.A source close to News24 confirmed that many of Zuma&rsquo;s backers were not in the NEC meeting on Saturday, but that their numbers had increased on Sunday.It is understood that Zuma's backers are not willing to go down without a fight, with more "fierce" fights expected on Monday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
