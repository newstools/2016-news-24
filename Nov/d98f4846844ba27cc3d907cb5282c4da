The unit, made up of various authorities including police and the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department,&nbsp;is a specialised&nbsp;team of officers and dogs who are trained to handle hijackings, robberies, bombs, kidnappings and drug-related incidents.Cars used by members of the unit will be unmarked, making it easier to infiltrate communities which are especially hard hit with drug problems.Eldorado Park, south of Johannesburg is one such area, so much so that President Jacob Zuma previously heeded the desperate calls of mothers who wrote a letter to him pleading for his assistance.Anti-drug activist and founder of Sharing Without Shame, Dereleen James, from Eldorado Park, said the initiative gives the community hope.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pleased about&nbsp;(the) launch as the initiative is one that we've been working on for a while now," she said.&ldquo;It strengthens the fight against substance abuse and gives our communities hope.&rdquo;It is expected&nbsp;that the&nbsp;unit will&nbsp;grow in the following financial years.Eldorado Park's Ward 17 councillor Peter Rafferty said a dedicated phone line where residents can report any illegal activity is also in the pipeline.&ldquo;This will enable JMPD to see hotspots and plan thorough operations based on information received by residents,&rdquo; said Rafferty.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
