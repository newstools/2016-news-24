He has in the past called for Zuma to step down."We urge the National Assembly to hear the people&rsquo;s motion and to act on its mandate by dealing with President Zuma&rsquo;s failure to respect his oath of office," he said.Pityana criticised Zuma for comments over the weekend that he knew there were people who were stealing, and threatened to reveal who they were. Zuma was addressing more than 3 000 ANC supporters at a cadres forum in Pietermaritzburg.Pityana asked if this made Zuma an accessory to crimes."We are saying no to a president who admits that he knows people are stealing from the state, and rather than locking them up, says he would rather bide his time and write a book about it."Zuma asked Save South Africa who they were saving the country from."We must Save South Africa from you, Mr President," Pityana replied."Because if we do nothing today, there will be no South Africa to save by 2019."He blamed Zuma for the worst unemployment levels in 13 years, slow economic growth and social tension at universities, in informal settlements and urban areas."The President has failed us, and he must go. He cannot be allowed to continue to violate the Constitution and disrespect his oath of office, or to allow the further capture of our state."WATCH this video:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
