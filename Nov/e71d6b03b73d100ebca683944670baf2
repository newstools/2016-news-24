At present all seems to be calm there. The South African police are also assisting with security. There is a heavy police presence," university spokesperson Willa de Ruyter told News24.According to De Ruyter, a group of "disgruntled people" torched a bus because they wanted exams suspended until next year.However, the university was not in a position to heed that demand as the exams had already been previously suspended. She said all students would start writing their final exams for 2016 on Monday."The ripple effect of suspending the exams on the majority of students is just too great. We cannot do that to them. And many of them indicated that they used the past few weeks to prepare for exams and they want to write now."She added that students were being transported by bus to the Tshwane Events Centre where they will write their exams. Security presence was also increased at the centre.De Ruyter said the university condemned any acts of violence. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
