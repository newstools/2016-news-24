Boko Haram also has carried out attacks inside Cameroon.The rights group calls for the three men's unconditional release, saying they were exercising their right to freedom of expression. It also raises concerns about trials of civilians in military courts.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
