The Calvinia Regional Court last week sentenced him to life, plus 26 years, for rape and sexual assault, Lieutenant-Colonel Dimakatso Mooi said. The sentences would run concurrently. Mooi said the 52-year-old man had been molesting his daughter since 2000, when she was 9. He made her believe he was preparing her to be a young lady, she said. The daughter reported what her father was doing in July 2013.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
