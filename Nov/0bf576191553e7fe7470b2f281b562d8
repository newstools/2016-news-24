Candyce.KrishnaWHEN a parent dropped her children off at a school on Wednesday morning, the last thing she expected to see was police vehicles and hear that armed men had escaped through the school s grounds. When I got there, police were questioning a man and it looked to me like he was explaining to police where he saw these men escape, said the parent who wants to remain anonymous. I had no idea what was going on, but the school assured me that the children were safe. Police spokesperson, Lieutenant-Colonel Zandra Wiid said an investigation into the allegations is under way. Police responded to a report of an alleged shooting at a primary school, she said.The parent said while driving on the main Harding Road, she saw a white sedan with a blue light with two male occupants. They then chased three suspects on foot, who then allegedly jumped over a fence and entered the school yard, said Wiid.Shots were also heard and the Port Shepstone Crime Prevention Unit members and K9 members responded.By the time they arrived there were no sign of the suspects or the white vehicle. We are currently looking into these allegations. Anyone who witnessed this can contact the Port Shepstone police on 10111, said Wiid.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
