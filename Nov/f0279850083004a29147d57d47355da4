Senator Leila de Lima says the petition she filed on Monday seeks to stop Duterte and his men from gathering information about her private life and disclosing it publicly, adding that the allegedly illegally obtained information should be destroyed. The petition is a test case because it challenges Duterte's immunity from lawsuits. De Lima says she also asked that Duterte be compelled to identify the "foreign country" he said helped him to "listen" to de Lima's communications. De Lima has long raised alarm over Duterte's brutal crackdown against drugs, earning Duterte's wrath.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
