This campaign is part of a bigger task, the task of rebuilding our families," Pillay said. Pillay was speaking in the rural KwaZulu-Natal town of Kilmun on Tuesday. He said certain family values and norms could be restored to help heal societal ills. "We should be all about rebuilding our family unit. This would restore the values we historically had. If our family is strong, our nation will be strong and nothing can stop us."Pillay was accompanied by Community Safety and Liaison MEC Mxolisi Kaunda, as well as mayors, local councillors and the top brass from the police and correctional services.More than 2 000 people attended the event at a sports field at Zidweni Hall.Pillay said forced marriages, involving the abduction of school girls, were reported as a serious problem in the region. He said other sexual offences had also come under the spotlight. "Community crime prevention structures, like policing forums, youth desks and ward safety communities are now in place."Pillay and Kaunda received progress reports from senior officials and committed to an "ongoing programme to make the region safe, especially for women and children".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
