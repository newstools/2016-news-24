The Pikoli report had listed a number of suspicious transactions related to the IPTS. No investigation was, however, authorized based on the report. The report was compiled in 2013 and the city council finally decided that the national treasury must do the full investigation, said Mettler.He said it was impossible to say how many people would be charged before the matter comes before the courts. It is for the Hawks and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to decide. The entire investigation will determine exactly how much money is involved, but we estimate it to amount to hundreds of millions rands, he said.The first case was registered with the Hawks in 2015. The Hawks are under no obligation to inform us who are arrested and when. We have indicated that we would like to see the arrests and prosecutions happen sooner rather than later, said Mettler.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
