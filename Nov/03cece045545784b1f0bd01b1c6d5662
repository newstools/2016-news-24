A shipment of 24 young elephants from Hwange to a safari park in southern China in July 2015 caused an international uproar.It appears the hyenas may have injured themselves when they were transported inside special containers on a flatbed truck from Hwange National Park (where they were captured) to Harare on Thursday. The extent of their injuries is unclear. One hyena is believed to have escaped en route to the airport though it's not clear whether this happened in Hwange or in Harare.The hyenas are now back in Hwange National Park, where they were captured. They have not been released back into the wild though: they are currently being held in an enclosure there.Sources say that the hyenas were due to travel on from Johannesburg to the Middle East and then China.&nbsp; They were destined for Hangzhou Safari Park in Hangzhou city in eastern China.Environment Minister Oppah Muchinguri said in January that Zimbabwe would sell wild animals, including hyenas, elephants, lions and baboons to China &ldquo;without hesitation&rdquo;. She said it was better to sell off wildlife like elephants to countries that can care for them than to let them die from drought. &ldquo;We are not going to apologise to anyone,&rdquo; she said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
