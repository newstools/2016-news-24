EFCC prosecutor Rotimi Oyedepo asked the court to order that the money be forfeited to the government but that was refused by the judge, who deferred his ruling until the trial of Dudafa and the other suspects, which he adjourned to mid-December. President Muhammadu Buhari, who defeated Jonathan in the 2015 vote, has launched a wide-ranging campaign against corruption targeting key members of the previous administration.Former ministers, prominent party chiefs, media owners and relations of the former president are in court over similar charges. The focus on officials from the former ruling party has led some critics to claim Buhari is using the anti-graft crackdown to silence political foes, an accusation dismissed by the government.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
