Police received information about a kidnapping and arrived at an abandoned house in the suburb around 18:00 on Tuesday evening, Captain Kay Makhubela said. They rescued three women and arrested eight men. The women had sustained burn wounds and it appeared they were tied up. It was unclear how long they had been held there. The women were apparently approached at a mall and fell victim to a “black dollar scam”. This involves the victim giving money to the scammer with the promise that they will get it back, multiplied several times. The victim is given a bag or a box, which they are told contains their money. They are told not to open it until they get home. When they do, they find it contains worthless paper. At some point the women were kidnapped and taken to the house. Makhubela said the case was a breakthrough as it fell with the 16 days of activism for no violence against women and children. “We are thankful that these women were rescued,” Makhubela said. The men would appear in the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court soon. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
