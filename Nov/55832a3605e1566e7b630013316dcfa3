The senate received more than 250 petitions against the proposed political appointees.Nigeria has been without ambassadors in places like Washington, London, Beijing and Brussels for more than a year.Tuesday's move comes after the Senate refused Buhari's request to pursue $30 billion in foreign loans - a surprising rejection from a legislature controlled by the president's party.It highlights fractures in the coalition which, in the 2015 elections, brought Buhari to become the first Nigerian to defeat a sitting president.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
