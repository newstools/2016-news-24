(Paul Herman, News24) Multimedia &nbsp; &nbsp; User Galleries &nbsp; &nbsp; News in Pictures Send us your pictures &nbsp; &nbsp; Send us your stories Cape Town - Newly reinstated Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) head Robert McBride says he is taking legal advice on whether he will sue the state and Police Minister Nathi Nhleko for malicious prosecution.McBride made his first appearance before Parliament's portfolio committee on police since his suspension was lifted by the Constitutional Court in September.He and his team were reporting to MPs on progress in implementing the Auditor-General's 2014/15 recommendations for the department.After the meeting, McBride told journalists that he was considering a legal suit against the state."I'll be taking advice on that. It's not definite yet, but I will be taking advice," he said.McBride said the possibility of a "political vendetta" against him would not stop him from getting on with his job of investigating corrupt police officials now that he was back on the job."It's irrelevant if there is [a political vendetta]. If it's there, I'll ignore it. I have work to do," he said."And a lot of the work we've done, the committee is reasonably happy with it. We need to do better and there is space for improvement."Investigating senior Saps membersMcBride was tight-lipped over the possibility of opening more cases against SAPS officials, but told News24 there were "quite a range" of investigations his department was looking into.He wouldn't comment on a possible investigation into Hawks head Berning Ntlemeza, saying IPID did not discuss investigations they were undertaking."We prefer to keep a low profile and let due process take its course."McBride said systemic corruption from senior police officials was the biggest issue facing his department."We may be lacking in some capacity and experience, but we'll take advice from others willing to assist us."If we are able to deal with systemic corruption in Saps, it sends a message," he said."Most systemic corruption is carried out by senior members, and if we are able to get prosecutions, we'll have a trickle down effect in terms of ethics and integrity."'We are stable, we have work to do'McBride said the IPID Act did not have a ceiling, and he could investigate any official in any police department.He also said the much talked about restructuring done by his predecessor was also being looked into, but he would wait for a report from the former executive director before deciding to halt it or not.McBride returned to work on October 19 following a decision by the police committee not to institute disciplinary action against him.A request had been submitted by Nhleko for Parliament to institute disciplinary action against McBride following September's Constitutional Court ruling that his suspension be declared invalid.McBride added his only focus now was to continue working."We are stable, we were here before the committee and we are moving forward. We have work to do." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
