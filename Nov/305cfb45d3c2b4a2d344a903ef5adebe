Fireworks are potentially dangerous. Indiscriminate discharging thereof causes traumatic behaviour by animals and is a noisy irritation to humans, said Councillor Pieter Terblanche of Ward 51 in Uitenhage.Fireworks may be discharged at the following areas: Uitenhage - open areas between Lovebird Street and Tiryville; Uitenhage Central Rugby Field (Old OC/Swifts rugby grouds). Despatch - open area opposite the waterwheel entrance in Main Street. KwaNobuhle - open area between Ponana Tini &amp; Tize Streets. A person who will be found using or discharging fireworks unlawfully in terms of the Explosives Act, will be fined a R2 000 admission of guilt fine, said Terblanche.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
