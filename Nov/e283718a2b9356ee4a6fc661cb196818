The Moroccan Association of Human Rights has appointed a lawyer to defend the girls who if convicted could be imprisoned for between six months and three years."We shouldn't be hypocrites. Moroccans have sex lives outside marriage, and it good that that there are homosexuals," the author said. Slimani, who raised eyebrows at home with her debut novel last year about a female nymphomaniac, said the oppression that women suffered had nothing to do with religion."Lots of imams and enlightened theologians will explain that to you... It is a question of human rights, sexual rights, the right to dignity and in particular the dignity of women's bodies."Slimani said a woman should not just be regarded as "a mother, nor a sister, nor a wife, but as a woman, an individual with their own rights."Torn between religious conservatism and opening up to the West, the overwhelming Muslim North African country has seen several controversies over moral issues in recent years. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
