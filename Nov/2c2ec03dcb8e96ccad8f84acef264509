The political science student faces a charge of malicious damage to property following stone throwing at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology's (CPUT) Cape Town campus, where a door was damaged during protests on October 24.In&nbsp;previous brushes with the law relating to university matters, Mlandu was arrested in connection with violence at UCT.He was expelled from UCT, but still remains involved with students there and is&nbsp;in negotiations with the university,&nbsp;which could see his expulsion reversed.&nbsp;On Thursday, the courtroom was packed with students and workers who came to support Mlandu when he&nbsp;appeared for the CPUT matter.The State opposed his release on bail, arguing that while Mlandu had no prior convictions,&nbsp;he had&nbsp;three pending cases against him.
