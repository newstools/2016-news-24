He said Castro had cautioned that when money was at stake, people took their eye off the revolution.&ldquo;When we go to conference of the ANC, there is a lot of cash flow around the conference. This prostitute called imperialism is deviating us, it is seducing us to take our eye off the ball,&rdquo; he said.The SACP's Solly Mapaila said Castro led by example.&ldquo;Let's not celebrate Fidel Castro in abstract. Let's criticise ourselves,&rdquo; the party&rsquo;s second deputy general secretary said.Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini called on alliance partners to unite in order to fight a shared enemy - poverty, unemployment, and inequality.&ldquo;Let us build a strong, united ANC-led alliance. Let's close ranks and fight the real fight,&rdquo; said Dlamini.Castro was Cuba&rsquo;s prime minister from 1959 to 1976 and president from 1976 to 2008, when ill health forced him to formally hand over power to his younger brother Raul.The bearded revolutionary survived a crippling US trade embargo and dozens, possibly hundreds, of assassination plots.The ANC would host events in his honour across the country.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
