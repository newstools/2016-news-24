nine years, without setting foot in a courtroom. And he
might not have to repay a cent of it, even if he is found guilty of gross
misconduct, according to Justice Minister Michael Masutha’s reply to a
parliamentary question from the FF Plus. FF Plus
MP Corné Mulder on Tuesday called for his matter to be concluded. It was a
disgrace that the process was being indefinitely protracted while taxpayers
were funding a convicted person’s life of luxury. “The FF
Plus will now put pressure on the Judicial Conduct Tribunal to finalise this
matter without delay, and insists that Motata
pays back a part of his salary,” Mulder said. Motata has been on special leave since January 2007, after he crashed
his Jaguar through the boundary wall of a house in Hurlingham, Johannesburg,
while drunk. He was found guilty of drunk driving in 2009. “No boer is going to undermine me; this used to be
the white man’s land but it is not anymore,” he said at the scene of his crash,
it emerged in court. Masutha
said proceedings at the Judicial Conduct Tribunal had been postponed until the
finalisation of Motata’s challenge to the
constitutionality of sections of the Judicial Services Commission Act. “However
Judge Motata’s special leave is not subject to a condition that the judge would
have to repay the money earned if he is
found guilty of gross misconduct by the Judicial Conduct Tribunal,” the
minister said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
