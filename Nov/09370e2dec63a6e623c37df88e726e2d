A total of 831 people have been arrested since February 1 this year.Schedule 5 offences are considered crimes so serious in terms of the Criminal Procedure Act that the applicant has to justify being granted bail.Paralympian Oscar Pistorius faced the same task of justifying bail when he first appeared in court charged with the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.BailProsecutor Neilen Chetty said the State would not oppose bail.Defence attorney Malixole Siqyana complained that so far he had not received information about what Nonxuba allegedly did to face such a serious charge.According to information read into the record by Chetty, on October 24 a bus driver was transporting students from a residence to the University of Cape Town campus.READ:&nbsp;What is decolonised education?Given the protests, there were security guards on the bus.

This led to mutterings from the public gallery of &ldquo;what happened to presumption of innocence?&rdquo;.&ldquo;You are in fact very fortunate to be getting bail in the first place, given the fact that this is your third offence. If this continues, you can be almost certain that bail will be denied.&rdquo;Outside he was treated to a hero's welcome and an impromptu march, accompanied by joyous singing, as the students made their way to the train and bus station.&ldquo;I have no words,&rdquo; he said, as supporters clamoured around him.&ldquo;Let it be known that we will not be silenced. We will not stop until there is free decolonised education.&rdquo;On Wednesday, another activist, Masixole Mlandu, is expected to appear in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court for alleged malicious damage to property.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
