Spokesperson Lisa M&ouml;rck said that the SPCA had received a call from a concerned member of the public before noon, insisting that a man had been attacked by two aggressive dogs. "Inspector Petros Simamane immediately responded and on arrival at the scene found a deceased unsterilised tan crossbreed male dog which had been shot.""The dog had a thick webbing collar and a heavy chain, which weighed 2.8kgs and was about 1.75 metres long, around its neck," she said. M&ouml;rck added that the second dog had been confined inside a property. "Four staff from the Kloof and Highway SPCA Inspectorate team immediately went to the property to assist Inspector Simamane. They tried to catch the dog which unfortunately escaped into nearby bush," she said. "Inspector Simamane was able to catch the dog using a net, with assistance from a member from the Metro Police. Unfortunately before the dog was restrained it chewed through the net, tried to bite Inspector Simamane and ran towards the crowd of people that had gathered and gunshots were heard," M&ouml;rck added. She said that the second dog died at the scene and that both bodies were brought back to the Kloof and Highway SPCA clinic for post-mortems and would also be sent for rabies testing. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
