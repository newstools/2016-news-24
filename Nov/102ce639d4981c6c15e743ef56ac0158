The educators in question were registered with Sace.Three bogus educators have also been identified in Mpumalanga and one educator, who has been at the University of Venda for 20 years, was deregistered, she said."Any educator that is teaching knowing they have a fraudulent qualification, run."Dipholo said they were closing in on these educators, adding that they were now looking at public schools."We are done with most private and independent schools.
