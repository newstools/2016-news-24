[NPA head] Shaun Abrahams went to Luthuli House and was given instructions to charge Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan," Maimane told hundreds of DA supporters in Pretoria.&nbsp;Maimane also claimed the ANC was against its own people and that the authors of the Constitution did not foresee that a "man with 738 charges of corruption and racketeering will one day occupy the Union buildings".Maimane said he was approached by people who asked him to drop the case against President Jacob Zuma in the interests of the country."I said, 'no I can't do that', I will be letting a criminal go free, which would make me no different to Shaun Abrahams."Imagine an independent body of state [taking] instructions from [ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe] and Jacob [Zuma]. The days of disrespecting the NPA are well amongst us," he said.&nbsp;Charges politically motivated"We are not here because I hate the ANC, we are here because we must remove the ANC. I have a headache from Jacob Zuma. He bores me."Earlier, supporters marched to the Pretoria Magistrate's Court, calling for the protection of the Constitution.&nbsp;The march was initially planned to rally behind Gordhan after he was charged with fraud by the NPA.Abrahams has since withdrawn the charges against Gordhan, former SARS boss Oupa Magashula and former SARS deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay.Opposition parties have questioned the validity of the fraud charges against Gordhan, saying they were politically motivated by those who sought to have undue influence over National Treasury. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
