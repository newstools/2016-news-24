In the gazetted announcement, it was stated that &ldquo;the Castle of Good Hope is arguably the oldest fortress and building in South Africa&rdquo;. Calvyn Gilfellan, CEO of the Castle board, says: &ldquo;This is another momentous occasion in the life of the Castle of Good Hope that now enjoys Grade I heritage status. This is confirmation of the true value of the Castle in the cultural heritage and history of the country &ndash; a real feather in our cap.&rdquo; &ldquo;As the legally mandated management agency for the Castle, it makes our work easier because we can approach various national partners to support us in our endeavours to manage, conserve, maintain and promote the Castle,&rdquo; he says. The next big step is the process to get the Castle listed as a Unesco World Heritage Site, a process which is already underway, Gilfellan says. If the international status is achieved, the Castle will be on par with the top heritage sites in the world, Gilfellan says. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
