"God told us: 'If you want a peaceful life, those who kill, kill them'."After the death of the taxi driver, parliamentarian El Hadj Diouf of the Workers and People's Party (PTP), part of Sall's ruling coalition, said criminals had been given "too many pardons.""Those who kill, steal, rape, do not deserve pardon. I think we have to go back (to the death penalty)," he told parliament.The move comes as part of a wider reform of the justice system following years of overcrowding in Senegal's jails and a recent riot over conditions.Sall and his justice minister, Sidiki Kaba, are openly against a return to the death penalty.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
