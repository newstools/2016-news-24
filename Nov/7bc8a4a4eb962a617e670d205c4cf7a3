While not directly implicating Zuma in any wrongdoing, Madonsela&rsquo;s report exposed the connections between his family and the Guptas.DA leader Mmusi Maimane said Zuma had behaved dishonourably.&ldquo;Given the scale of the state capture that is detailed in the report, which he has allowed and indeed fostered, he cannot continue in office. The Zuma presidency has been a blight on South Africa - only his resignation can help repair the damage he has caused.&ldquo;The manner in which Jacob Zuma has conducted himself is completely dishonourable and unbecoming of the nation&rsquo;s President. He has actively tried to delay the release of this report, disrespected the Office of the Public Protector, and wasted millions of rands of public money in frivolous litigation,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;READ MADONSELA'S INTERVIEW HEREA woman at the centre of the state capture storm, former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor, said that those responsible needed to be called to account.&nbsp;She warned that Madonsela&rsquo;s efforts could be in vain if remedial action was left to politicised arms of the state, including the National Prosecuting Authority. &nbsp;&ldquo;My worry is that the NPA is so politicised and there is so much political meddling. The President just interferes with them. This has been demonstrated by their handling of the Gordhan and McBride matters,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;All this will come to naught if Shaun Abrahams remains in that office. If anyone disturbs the political agenda, they refuse to follow up. The NPA is a joke.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
