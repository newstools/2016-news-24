	     Durban - Police Search and Rescue Unit technicians recovered the body of a man who was electrocuted in a stream in Cato Manor on Wednesday. It is understood that the man had come into contact with live wires used for illegal connections to shacks in the area.  There is a well known latticework of electrical connections that makes moving through the river dangerous.  A passer-by spotted the body of the man and raised the alarm, and rescue technicians then responded to the scene.  Carefully navigating the live wires, officers placed the body into a Stokes rescue basket and hauled it from the river.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
