	     Cape Town – Four suspects were arrested after 771 000 Mandrax tablets were found stashed in false compartments in a truck - part of an alleged drug convoy - in Vredenburg, the Hawks in the Western Cape said on Tuesday. The suspected drug dealers, aged 31 to 58, were stopped on the R45 on Monday night after a tip-off, said provincial Hawks spokesperson Captain Lloyd Ramovha. Officers uncovered the more than 771 000 Mandrax tablets hidden in false compartments in the truck. The drugs had an estimated street value of R7.5m. Ramovha said the four suspects came from Gauteng. They were expected to appear on drug dealing charges in the Vredenburg Magistrate’s Court soon. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
