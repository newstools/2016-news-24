Tessa Turvey was responding to Eskom CEO Brian Molefe, who said on Thursday that the reason he was in Saxonwold was not to visit the Guptas but to go to a shebeen in the area.Molefe was reacting to&nbsp;former public protector Thuli Madonsela&rsquo;s &ldquo;State of Capture&rdquo; report, which was released on Wednesday.The document contains cellphone evidence that Molefe and Ajay Gupta, the eldest of three Gupta brothers, made 58 telephone calls to one another between August 2015 and March 2016.&nbsp;The report details phone calls between Molefe and Ronica Ragavan, a long-time Gupta associate who was recently appointed acting CEO of Oakbay Investments, the family's holding company.Cellphone tracking records Madonsela's investigators obtained indicated that Molefe was at or near the Guptas' Saxonwold, Johannesburg, compound 19 times between August 5 and November 17, 2015.Molefe broke down in tears as he hit back at these details&nbsp;during an Eskom results presentation."My cellphone reflects that I was in Saxonwold 14 times, close to the herd of proverbial goats. My cellphone reflects I was in the area,&rdquo; Molefe said.&nbsp;"There's a shebeen there, two streets away from the Gupta(s). I will not admit or deny that I've gone to the shebeen.&nbsp;But there is a shebeen there."&nbsp;However, Turvey told News 24 that there was no shebeen in the small upmarket area near the Johannesburg zoo.&ldquo;I would know," she said.Turvey said she knew every street in the very well.&ldquo;We would appreciate if Mr Molefe would tell us the address of this shebeen because if there is one it must be illegal and then must be closed down,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;According to a tweet from the DA&rsquo;s Mabine Seabe, the shebeen was, in fact, the Zoo Lake Bowling club, which closed in 2014. He said he was a regular there and never saw Molefe.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
