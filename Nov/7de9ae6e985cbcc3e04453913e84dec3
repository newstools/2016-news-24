They suffered smoke inhalation and minor injuries.At the time, the CPUT Fees Must Fall movement distanced itself from the property damage. It was "thuggery coming from rogue elements who wish to hijack and appropriate the good name of our genuine struggle", it said.At least 20 CPUT students have been arrested since the start of the campus unrest.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
