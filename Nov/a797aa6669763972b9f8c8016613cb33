It is understood that the man had come into contact with live wires used for illegal connections to shacks in the area. There is a well known latticework of electrical connections that makes moving through the river dangerous. A passer-by spotted the body of the man and raised the alarm, and rescue technicians then responded to the scene. Carefully navigating the live wires, officers placed the body into a Stokes rescue basket and hauled it from the river. &nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
