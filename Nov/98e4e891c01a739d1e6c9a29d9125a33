You heard me telling my story, how I was treated in the process of this report," he said.He said, in his view, the report affected him and many others. "We would want that work to be done properly. And that's why we are working on it. I can't then jump when I have these views to establish a commission."The EFF boycotted the question-and-answer session.Ndlozi said the party was ready to "embarrass" Zuma again through the courts, as it did during the Nkandla saga, if he did not follow Madonsela's recommendations."As an illegitimate president, a declared constitutional fugitive and delinquent, we are on guard to make sure he does not escape the&nbsp;State of Capture&nbsp;report remedial action."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
