Should there be rainfall before the release, the plan would be reconsidered. &nbsp;The water would be released into the Nuwejaarspruit, which joins the Wilge River on the outskirts of Harrismith. Farmers adjacent to the river were asked to remove pumps, livestock, and farming equipment.&ldquo;Farmers are also requested not to abstract the water for agricultural purposes. Offenders will be prosecuted as strict compliance monitoring will be enforced.&rdquo;Johannesburg Water also warned residents to use water sparingly. The Lenasia high-level reservoir, Corrine Moore and Alexander Park reservoirs were running low due to consumption exceeding supply. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
