The process to fill the vacancy has been ongoing since 2015, when the committee initially recommended former ANC MP Cecil Burgess to fill the crucial post.The recommendation was abandoned when the ruling party could not get the numbers in Parliament to pass it.Dintwe was one of 10 shortlisted candidates in the committee&rsquo;s fourth attempt to fill the position. The candidates were interviewed in a two-day marathon process earlier in November.In its report, which was published in Parliament&rsquo;s Announcements, Tablings and Committee reports on Thursday, the committee said Dintwe impressed all the members of the subcommittee, which had been in charge of the interviews.&ldquo;The Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence, therefore, unanimously nominates him for consideration by the National Assembly, for recommendation to the President for appointment as the Inspector General of Intelligence.&rdquo;The recommended candidate now needs the support of a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.The nomination will be debated in Parliament before the end of the year.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
