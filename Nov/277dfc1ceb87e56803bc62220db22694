As a result, the City had increased capacity for forensic investigations.During the ANC&rsquo;s tenure, Makhubo said 207 investigations were concluded, 251 officials were dismissed and 97 criminal cases opened.&nbsp;"For Mashaba to suggest that the ANC administration swept these under the carpet and never acted on them is malicious."The ANC in the region would fight to defend the "democratic gains" in council chambers, courts and the streets.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
