My five-year-old son is at home," Mohamed Khalid, a resident of south Khartoum, told AFP.The capital's squares were free of the normal traffic jams, while many shops, cafes and restaurants in downtown Khartoum and Omdurman remained shut.International condemnation&nbsp;"There are not many people on the roads, which has impacted my business since I opened in the morning," said Ahmad Saleh, an owner of a grocery shop in downtown Omdurman.Restaurant owners said they had told their workers to prepare less food, anticipating a drop in business."There is at least a 40% drop in business. My usual customers are other shopkeepers and many of them have closed their shops today," said Ibrahim Mohamed, who runs a restaurant in north Khartoum."Some of my workers have also not reported to work today."However, state employees turned up for work, transported by government buses to their offices.The authorities are determined to avoid any repetition of 2013 unrest that was sparked by a similar round of fuel subsidy cuts.It was suppressed only by a deadly crackdown by security forces that drew international condemnation.Rights groups say that crackdown left about 200 people dead, while the government put the death toll at less than 100.President Omar al-Bashir's regime has been forced to progressively reduce fuel subsidies since 2011 when South Sudan seceded and took with it nearly three-quarters of the formerly united country's oil reserves.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
