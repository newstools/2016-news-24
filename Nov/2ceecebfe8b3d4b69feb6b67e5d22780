As they were cracking it, it was discovered that one of the family members of a politician is a shareholder in one of the companies implicated,&rdquo; he said.Maseko added that SARS was also dealing with very powerful people who were dodging taxes in the country.&ldquo;You start understanding why SARS becomes a target for them because these forces outside of government are seeing a state institution that is becoming a threat to their economic interests."It&rsquo;s not a coincidence that you have an NPA that behaves the way it does today, [and] it&rsquo;s not a coincidence that you have the Hawks behaving the way they do. You are dealing with forces that have unlimited resources,&rdquo; he said.Maseko said it was pivotal for South Africans to stand up and fight to protect their institutions at all costs.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
