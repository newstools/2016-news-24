Our responsibility is to make sure that all structures of local government in all parts of the country serve our people all the time."&nbsp;In the August 3 local elections the ANC lost the key metros of Tshwane, Johannesburg and Nelson Mandela Bay. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
