Moss called for calm amid heavy rains and threats of flash flooding from Thursday through the weekend across Gauteng, including the City of Tshwane. He said the Tshwane emergency services put out a warning for expected heavy rains after the weather service informed disaster management structures that there was a high likelihood of widespread heavy rains and thunderstorms over Gauteng from Thursday. &nbsp; "While the city has the necessary infrastructure to mitigate some of the effects of these downpours, it is a reality that our city's infrastructure cannot entirely prevent flash floods from occurring on the roads and in our homes." Heavy rains swept through parts of Gauteng on Wednesday. Several people were unaccounted by late Wednesday and Moss on Thursday said &nbsp;four people had died.&nbsp; The boundary wall of the Johannesburg Zoo had also collapsed. "Four people died after a cloud burst at Midrand and OR Tambo, flooding the freeway at the Linksfield off-ramp. Massive water accumulated at low-lying areas of the freeway and many cars were caught up unexpectedly and covered with water up to their roofs," said Moss. The city also said thunderstorms had caused power outages in various parts of Tshwane on Thursday and technicians were working to restore the power supply in affected areas.
