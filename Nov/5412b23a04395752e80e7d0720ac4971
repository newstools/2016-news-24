The Rosebank Killarney Gazette reported that the boundary wall on Jan Smuts Avenue had collapsed. The zoo's spokesperson Noeleen Mattera told the local newspaper that she would comment once the damage had been assessed. It was not yet clear whether any animals were on the loose. EMER-G-MED spokesperson Max Cohen said more than 10 vehicles had been pushed off the highway down an embankment and were completely submerged along the N3 in Linksfield. More than 100 vehicles had been affected in the incident. Cohen said one person had drowned and paramedics were attending to several patients with minor injuries. He urged motorists to avoid the area as the highway would remain closed for some time. Flights out of OR Tambo International Airport were also delayed as the stormy weather hit Johannesburg.
