Its R10bn, 10-year contract with the department expires next year.Dlamini said the department was looking into developing its IT infrastructure, value-chain compliance issues, and dealing with syndicates trying to defraud the department.She said, as their work improved, so the syndicates became more sophisticated in how they "steal our money". She again expressed a wish to report back to the committee at a later date."Everyone is busy that we drive the processes faster and we've even asked people who are dealing with the [other] processes to leave everything and focus on this."Sassa CEO Thokozani Magwaza&nbsp;said the syndicates had been reported on before and were public knowledge. A number of high-profile court cases were currently being heard in a bid to expose corruption. These included a case with leasing firm Trifecta/Delta.Dlamini left the meeting around noon, without giving the committee a date when she would report back on her department&rsquo;s readiness.DA MP Timothy Brauteseth told Magwaza that he hoped he would be in the office on Christmas, given the approaching April deadline and the department's non-committal answers.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
