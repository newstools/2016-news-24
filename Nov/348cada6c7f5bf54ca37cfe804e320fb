She emphasised that Motsoeneng's appointment to a position of authority or leadership would be improper until the SABC's review application had been finalised."With the greatest respect to the Public Protector, that is simply an opinion," said Bester.Madonsela's report did not specifically say he could not be appointed, or should be sacked.Bester said the DA claimed to have high regard for due process in its claim that the SABC's handling of the Motsoeneng matter had been a "charade" partly driven by Motsoeneng himself, yet it did not serve court papers on Motsoeneng for Tuesday's hearing, violating court procedure.The DA simply delivered them to the Cape Town offices of the SABC, expecting the office to track him down, he said. It was a known fact, including in the DA, that Motsoeneng was based in Johannesburg. The party's actions left his lawyers with two days to prepare for the application.He said Motsoeneng had been prejudiced and he should not have to pay the costs for what was essentially an SABC issue.The application was adjourned to Thursday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
