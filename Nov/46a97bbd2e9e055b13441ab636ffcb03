"It's an interesting development. It's a suspicious move by Zuma, especially that the NPA head withdrew charges against (Finance Minister Pravin) Gordhan."Holomisa said Zuma should state his reasons for intending to suspend Abrahams and be fair to him."Zuma should indicate what are his worries. Is it because of the charges related to the minister?&rdquo;Holomisa advised the National Prosecuting Authority head to write back to Zuma to demand his reasons for wanting to suspend him.Meanwhile, Cope leader&nbsp;Mosiuoa Lekota said it was a calculated move by Zuma."It is normal procedure, so that Zuma can say he has given him a hearing. It's in keeping with the law.&rdquo;Cope was of the view that Abrahams was unfit to hold office.The Presidency on Tuesday said Zuma had asked Abrahams, director of public prosecutions Sibongile Mzinyathi and acting special director of public prosecutions Dr Torie Pretorius to make written representations why they should not be suspended or face an inquiry into their fitness to hold office. Zuma&rsquo;s decision followed a request by Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation for him to suspend the three advocates pending an inquiry into their fitness to hold office. Both organisations had raised concerns about how the three advocates conducted the aborted prosecution of Minister Pravin Gordhan, former deputy SA Revenue Service commissioner Ivan Pillay, and former Sars commissioner Oupa Magashula on fraud charges.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
