Gates' and Zuckerberg's foundations are among the company's high-profile backers.But Bridge International has courted controversy with Liberian teachers threatening to strike earlier this year over government plans to outsource all primary education to the private US-owned company.In Uganda, government inspectors said children were being taught in sub-standard facilities and unsanitary conditions.Bridge International, which claims to have 12 000 students in Uganda, said it would challenge the High Court ruling. "We are extremely disappointed for our pupils and disagree with this ruling," said liaison officer Godwin Matsiko.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
