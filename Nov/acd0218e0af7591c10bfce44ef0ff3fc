Should we identify any of the perpetrators, they will be held accountable for their actions. Anyone with information should report it to campus control," said Patel.Protests 'sullied'The South African Jewish Board of Deputies, in a Facebook post, said the anti-Semitic graffiti that appeared on the walls of Solomon Mahlangu House yesterday [Monday] was indicative of the ugly racism that had unfortunately surfaced during the student protests."We note that this follows a Jewish student being called a 'Mother-f***ing Jew' on [a] Wits campus a couple of weeks ago."The organisation said the dean of students had confirmed that the graffiti had been removed and that an investigation was underway."Hate-filled graffiti like this has no place in our country and must be condemned in the strongest possible terms. We call on the university community, regardless of their views on Fees Must Fall, to dissociate themselves from such hateful rhetoric against their fellow South Africans."Legitimate causes like the student protest must not be allowed to be sullied by hate and threats of this nature," the organisation said.Taken at #Wits.
