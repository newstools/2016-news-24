I'm unsure of all of the details but my point of this post is actually just to send a shout out to both the police as well as the staff of Cycle Sphere," she wrote."Brilliant responses from both sides and things were under control quickly," she added.Cycle Sphere's Greg Albert who took on the knife-wielding man downplayed his bravery."I was in my shop and I heard screaming and ran outside and he [the vagrant] was just wielding his knife around.""I managed to arrest him yes but it was nothing heroic. Four police vehicles descended on the scene very quickly and took him into custody," Albert added.Police confirmed on Wednesday that the man was disarmed and detained, but was later released as no case was opened against him.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
