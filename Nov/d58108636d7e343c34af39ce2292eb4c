The announcement was made after Mulder indicated at the party's reorganisation congress in Kempton Park on Saturday that he would be stepping down ."Dr Mulder said he does not intend to participate in the 2019 election, and for that reason it is only fair to give a new leader the opportunity to establish himself or herself up to the election in 2019," the party said in a statement. Mulder became the party's leader 15 years ago, after being elected unopposed in 2001 with the departure of ex-army general Constand Viljoen.He indicated he was willing to stay on for a transitional period as a FF Plus MP. He had been in Parliament this year for an uninterrupted 28 years, making him the MP with the longest continuous service. Advocate Anton Alberts would replace Groenewald as the party's chair.Groenewald said it was a privilege to serve for decades in Parliament alongside Mulder and that it had prepared him well for his new role."There are few people in South Africa with the profound knowledge of the political situation in South Africa as Dr Mulder."Groenewald said he was proud to take the party into the future with a strong leadership team as support."We realise there are many challenges on the road ahead, but I am positive that there is a future for everyone in the country and that the ANC might be defeated at the polls. The FF Plus will continue to contribute to this fight."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
