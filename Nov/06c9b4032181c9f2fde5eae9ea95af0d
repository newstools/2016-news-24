A police statement on Friday said the man was arrested during Halloween celebrations on Monday when he disguised himself in a devil's costume to meet colleagues at a popular bar complex in the southern city of Malaga. Police said they began investigations last month when Malaga agents found a "hitman's kit" that included two guns, a silencer, ammunition, eight mobile phones, false identity papers and $5 500 in cash. The statement said the 47-year-old man of Algerian background is on Frances's most-wanted list for suspected murder, drug-trafficking and money-laundering. His name was not released. Two Spaniards who allegedly helped him hide in Spain were also arrested. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
