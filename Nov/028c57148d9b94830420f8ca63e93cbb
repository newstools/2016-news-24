According to farmworker rights activist Billy Claasen, the farmer allegedly assaulted worker Johannes Baadjies on a farm Sewester in Lutzville then offered him R400 to keep quiet about it. The 48-year-old farmer was arrested on Sunday and was released on bail after a special court hearing, police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andre Traut confirmed. Claasen said the matter was postponed to November 27. News24 was on Monday not able to get hold of the farmer. Further details were not immediately available, but according to a travel blog, Marktoe, the farmer started a workers' trust on the farm, which specialises in grapes and vegetables. Through the trust, workers were contracted to produce seed crops. The case comes hot on the heels of the shocking "coffin case", in which Middelburg's Victor Mlotshwa was forced into a coffin and threatened with being torched over alleged trespassing. Two men, Theo Jackson and Willem Oosthuizen, appeared in the Middelburg Magistrate's Court on Wednesday over the incident and will remain behind bars until they appear in court again on January 25. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
