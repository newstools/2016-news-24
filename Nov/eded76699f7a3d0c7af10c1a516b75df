Station staff were having a festive get-together on Friday night when they were alerted by fishermen about a couple who appeared to be in trouble on Strandfontein Beach."We dispatched our sea rescue vehicle and our rescue quad bike and on arrival on the scene we found an abandoned vehicle in amongst the sand dunes and we activated the SA Police Services," said NSRI station commander Vaughn Seconds. Police then located the man and woman running along Lukkanon Drive on the beachfront.The couple, both in their thirties and from Mitchell's Plain, were in shock having been hijacked by a group of men."The men had driven their vehicle... in amongst the sand dunes but the couple were able to escape."NSRI medics treated them for shock.Police are investigating the incident.Meanwhile in Kommetjie, NSRI officials assisted with their more conventional water-based duties when they helped a pair of crayfish catchers who had been blown out to sea on Saturday."We were diverted to respond to assist two local men, aged 31 and 33, being blown out to sea on a small inflatable craft at Bone Yards, offshore of Kommetjie," said Kommetjie station commander, Ian Klopper.The men had drifted 100 meters off-shore, but were transported to safety by the NSRI officials.Crayfish season officially opened on Saturday.
