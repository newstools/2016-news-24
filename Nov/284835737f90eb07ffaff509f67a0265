This was the first time an African head of state was tried by an African court for crimes against humanity, war crimes and acts of torture.&nbsp; With Burundi, South Africa and Gambia having withdrawn from the International Criminal Court (ICC), African Union (AU) Commission chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma recently used Habr&eacute;&rsquo;s conviction as an example of how AU-agreed and funded African courts can deliver their own justice, without the ICC.&nbsp; Jacqueline Moudeina is the Chadian prosecutor who represented 4 445 victims in the case against Habre.&nbsp; Speaking in the upcoming Al Jazeera documentary, Hiss&egrave;ne Habr&eacute;: Dictator on Trial, Moudeina &nbsp;says, "Getting to a point where we can try Hiss&egrave;ne Habr&eacute; is a turning point for Africa&hellip; It&rsquo;s a turning point in justice. Africa is taking its responsibilities seriously when it comes to its own children massacring their population." But she is anything but complimentary about the African Union&rsquo;s role in this. "We were so na&iuml;ve; today I laugh at our naivety. On our side we had the legal base that was needed. It was the convention against torture. All the necessary conditions were met to put Hiss&egrave;ne Habr&eacute; on trial. But he was a former African head of state and the African Union is nothing but a union of African heads of state who cover for each other."Human rights violations&nbsp;An estimated 40 000 people were killed and 200 000 tortured during Habr&eacute;&rsquo;s eight-year rule. Habr&eacute; did not speak a single word during the eight months of his trial, not looking once at the hundreds of his victims who gave their testimonies day after day. He is now appealing.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Special African Tribunal in Senegal (Supplied: Al Jazeera)Hiss&egrave;ne Habr&eacute;: Dictator on Trial also investigates what turned Chad&rsquo;s former president into such a bloodthirsty dictator, placing some of the blame on France and America, who supported him blindly because he was an ally against Colonel Muammar Gaddafi in neighbouring Libya.&nbsp;The documentary hears testimony that the CIA paid Habr&eacute;&rsquo;s notorious secret police force, DDS, and that some of the DDS&rsquo;s most feared torturers were trained in America.&nbsp;Hank Cohen, the USA&rsquo;s Secretary of State of African Affairs from 1989-1993, admits in the documentary, &ldquo;Of course we knew about human rights violations in Chad. It was not an issue for us&hellip; Our main focus was Libya&hellip; We frequently have to help people who are not very nice to do our things but we did not regret anything there. It is realpolitik.&rdquo; Human Rights Watch spokesperson Reed Brody, nicknamed &ldquo;the dictator hunter&rdquo;, was a legal counselor on the case. He says the USA&rsquo;s support for Habr&eacute; is part of a larger trend. &nbsp;&ldquo;Hiss&egrave;ne Habr&eacute; is the fourth dictator charged with crimes against humanity who was supported by the Reagan administration&hellip; You have Augusto Pinochet in Chile; you have Hiss&egrave;ne Habr&eacute; in Chad; you have Duvalier in Haiti; and you have Rios Monte in Guatemala.&rdquo; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
