"Yesterday alone 35 people have been killed and more than 100 others wounded. Most of those killed are the combatants but there also civilian casualties on the both sides of Galkayo."Another resident, Bile Abdulahi, said there was no fighting on Monday but that the city remained tense. "There are still some dead bodies strewn around the contested area. Fighting can resume anytime," he said.Somalia is in the process of selecting a new parliament, upper house and president in a limited franchise election that involves 14 000 delegates from all regional states, including Galmudug and Puntland.Political tensions have been rising and threats from the Al-Qaeda-linked Shabaab militants have increased in the run-up to the delayed vote, originally due in August.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
