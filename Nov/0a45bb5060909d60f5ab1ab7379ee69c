Tuesday's statement from the force says one of Belmokhtar's wives, Asma Kadousi, was arrested on Saturday along with a female companion en route from the militant stronghold of Darna, an eastern city, where she gave birth to a baby. Kadousi was reportedly heading to the central province of Joufra. The statement says Belmokhtar is believed to be in southern Libya. Belmokhtar is linked to the 2013 attack on a Western-owned gas facility in Algeria that killed scores of hostages, including Americans. A US drone strike last year failed to kill him in eastern Libya. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
