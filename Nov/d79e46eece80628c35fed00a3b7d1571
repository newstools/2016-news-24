They also wanted an inquiry instituted against the three to see if they were fit to hold office.President's conduct 'not irrational, unlawful'The bid was launched following what had been largely described as a blunder over the announcement of charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and two former South African Revenue of Service officials Oupa Magashula and Ivan Pillay. This was for an early retirement package Gordhan signed off on for Pillay in 2010 while he was commissioner at the revenue service.Abrahams withdrew the charges on October 31.In his judgment Mlambo said the relief sought by the two organisations was mostly based on media reports. He also raised concern over the use of the courts to compel Zuma to do something the applicants wanted him to do. He said this would lead to them straying into the terrain of the executive."The case before us deals with very important constitutional issues."The full bench of judges said the president's request for additional time was not unreasonable."The conduct of the president was not irrational and unlawful," said the judge.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
