Until it wasn't.They were travelling in separate trucks on the N3 in the Linksfield area on Wednesday afternoon when heavy rain turned into flash floods.According to 25-year-old Boda, they were moving slowly in the traffic as rain battered down and the wind howled. Cars were pulling over and stopping because it was so bad. After a while, traffic came to a dead stop.&ldquo;Then, after about 30 minutes, I saw cars floating down the road like boats,&rdquo; he told News24 on Thursday.Dingiswayo, 31, said he was &ldquo;shocked and surprised&rdquo; by what he saw.&ldquo;I could see the cars far down the road floating. Before I knew what was happening, you could see people in trouble.&rdquo;Seven people savedGALLERY: Chaos as flash floods hit JoburgDingiswayo and Boda first tried to save a woman whose car filled with water.&ldquo;I used the belt from the truck to fasten myself while Lucas anchored me and I went to get her,&rdquo; Dingiswayo said.&ldquo;We tried so hard to save her, but she died. It will haunt me forever. I could not sleep thinking about it.&rdquo;Using the same technique, they managed to bring seven people to the safety of the trailers hitched to their trucks.&ldquo;There were many that were screaming for help and we took them out of their cars. There were a lot of people sitting on top of our trailers,&rdquo; Dingiswayo said.Making the effort to help others was something everyone had to do, he said.&ldquo;How can I just sit and watch people drowning and screaming? I have to go and help everyone I can. It is important.&rdquo;&ldquo;You cannot leave your people to just suffer,&rdquo; Boda agreed.Donald Stockhall, one of the directors at truck company DPMM, said he was proud of his drivers.&ldquo;Whatever they did, they took the initiative themselves.
