He died about two hours before the verdict was handed down.People who were terminally ill were not only vulnerable because of their disease. Lower levels of education caused an even greater power imbalance in their relationship with their doctors.In developed countries such as the Netherlands, Canada, and the US state of Oregon, voluntary euthanasia is legal."In our community, there are people, including doctors, who will do anything for money and would not hesitate to abuse this power imbalance between doctor and patient for financial gain."The prohibition of voluntary euthanasia protects the vulnerable and society against this evil."Advocate C H Bergen and A J D'Oliveira presented argument on behalf of the HPCSA.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
