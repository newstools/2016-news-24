	     Cape Town – More than 30 people were injured during Guy Fawkes celebrations in Cape Town, including a 14-year-old boy who lost parts of three fingers, the City of Cape Town said on Monday. Nearly 30 000 people visited designated fireworks sites at the weekend, and 32 injuries were reported, the City of Cape Town's JP Smith said in a statement. The busiest sites were Table View and Maiden’s Cove, where the highest number of injuries were recorded. The 14-year-old boy was injured when fireworks exploded in his left hand in Table View. He was treated on the scene, before being transported to the hospital. Call to ban fireworks "I am satisfied that the City did everything possible to ensure the evening was well managed. The injuries are very unfortunate, especially with the number being higher than the previous year," Smith said. "Fireworks are dangerous and need to be handled with care. Guy Fawkes continues to be a massive headache that we can frankly do without. The City has done all it can in terms of our legislated authority. "Given the ongoing complaints from the public, we hope that National Government will look at banning the sale of fireworks, as trying to stop the ensuing chaos once those fireworks are in circulation is almost impossible," Smith said. Meanwhile, 182 people were arrested and 833 fines were issued for various offences by the City’s traffic services. These included outstanding warrants and drunk driving.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
