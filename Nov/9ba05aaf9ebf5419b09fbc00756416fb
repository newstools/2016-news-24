He has always denied the charges.ICC boycott growsThe summit comes amid growing opposition to the ICC among African leaders, who accuse the court of prosecuting alleged crimes in Africa while ignoring those elsewhere in the world. Burundi, South Africa and the Gambia have all pulled out of the court's founding treaty, the Rome statute, in recent weeks.Kenya, Namibia and Uganda have indicated they may follow suit.Hosting the summit is a diplomatic coup for Morocco as it seeks to reassert its influence in Africa.In July, the kingdom announced it wanted to join the African Union and in September it lodged a formal application.King Mohamed VI has since toured east Africa in a bid to woo support and after the Marrakesh talks he is due to visit Addis Ababa where the AU is based.Morocco pulled out of what was then called the Organisation of African Unity in 1984 in protest at its admission of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic declared by the pro-independence Polisario Front in the Western Sahara.The move came at the height of the armed conflict between the Polisario and Morocco over the former Spanish colony.A UN-supervised ceasefire has been in effect since 1991 but a quarter of a century of efforts for a lasting peace have led nowhere.Morocco controls all the main towns with the Polisario confined to a narrow strip in the desert interior. Tens of thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in camps in neighbouring Algeria.Algeria has long backed the Polisario and Morocco's bid for AU membership has set off what is likely to be dogged diplomatic battle for influence between the North African rivals.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
