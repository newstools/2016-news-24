Madonsela was investigating claims of undue influence by the family over Zuma.&ldquo;The Constitution provides that everyone has the right to administrative action that is lawful, reasonable and procedurally fair,&rdquo; the presidency said.On Tuesday, Gauteng Judge President Dunstan Mlambo struck Co-operative Governance Minister Des Van Rooyen's application to interdict the report off the roll because of lack of urgency.The High Court also permitted opposition parties, who had initially applied to oppose the president's application, to join in the matter. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
