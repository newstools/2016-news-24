It will burn until we get the rains we expect on Tuesday."Thuynsma said that the blaze had also moved near to the Hells Hoogte Pass. &nbsp;&nbsp;"The wind changed and it moved up onto the ridge of the mountain. This opens a new set of dilemmas for the evening. We are planning where to post people and also arranging relief crews for tomorrow," he said."No loss of property or life has been reported to me but that said, anything can change with the wind through the night." &nbsp;Large #wildfire burning in Banhoek Valley started last night, many agencies on scene including @vwsfires. #BanhoekFire Pic: @MichaelJordaan pic.twitter.com/3Yc4cGUEYq24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
