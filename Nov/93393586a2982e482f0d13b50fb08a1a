We want to assure the country that the youth league will attend the State of the Nation address to defend the nation and the revolution," Maine was quoted as saying."The Youth League will physically remove woodworkers from Parliament. We cannot allow [EFF leader] Julius Malema and his monkeys to run our country amok and turn this country into a banana republic.""Woodworkers", or EFF members, was a reference to Malema getting a G in woodwork, on the standard grade, in matric.Cope said it was informed on October 30 that the NPA would not prosecute Maine."No explanation was provided for this decision, so Maine won't have his day in court," spokesperson Dennis Bloem said.Bloem questioned why Maine was not prosecuted, yet Malema was facing criminal charges under the apartheid-era Riotous Assemblies Act of 1956 for allegedly urging his supporters to invade vacant land."Collen Maine threatens the country with civil war. The lives and the stability of the country were threatened by this dangerous and reckless statement, and Shaun Abrahams sees nothing wrong in that," Bloem said.Cope said its president, Mosiuoa Lekota, would take the matter up with the ministers of justice and police.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
