But speaking in Lagos on Wednesday, Obasanjo served signal that the era of being soft on the Buhari-led administration Buhari leads is over. Delivering the keynote at the First Akintola Williams Annual Lecture, Obasanjo lashed at the Buhari government for repeatedly lumping the country's three previous administrations (including the one he, Obasanjo led) together and then accusing them of misgovernance. He also advised Buhari to stop dwelling on the past, saying since he was elected to change the country, he should concentrate on clearing the mess he inherited. "Now that we have had change because the actors and the situation needed to be changed, let us move forward to have progress through a comprehensive economic policy and programme that is intellectually, strategically and philosophically based," Obasanjo was quoted as saying. A Vanguard report said that Obasanjo urged Buhari to rise to the challenges posed by the current recession in Nigeria, noting that orders, wishful thinking and blame game "would not solve the hapless affairs in the country".&nbsp;Obasanjo came into power in 2015. &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
