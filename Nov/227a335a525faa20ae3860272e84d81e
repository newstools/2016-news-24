The coup led to the formation of "anti-Balaka" vigilante units, drawn from the Christian majority, which began to target Muslims. Both sides committed widespread atrocities.Militias are still flourishing given the weakness of the state.Former colonial power France intervened in 2013 to stop violent Christian-Muslim clashes and formally ended its peacekeeping mission only last month, hailing it a success despite fresh outbreaks of violence.That leaves mainly the UN's 12 500-strong Minusca peacekeeping mission to protect civilians from armed groups.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
