The minister will study and consider the report [and] we believe that on Friday she will make an announcement," said basic education spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga.Pupils from Giyani and Malamulele confessed to having had access to the Mathematics Paper II question paper, days before the exam.Tinyiko Khosa, 52, who owns two independent schools in Malamulele, some 35km away from Giyani, has been arrested for the leak.While pupils are due to complete their exams, the department said the results for affected pupils might have to be temporarily shelved."What is likely to happen is that the results of the affected learners will be withheld until such time [that] the investigation is complete," said Mhlanga.An investigation by the Hawks revealed that pupils in Giyani received an electronic version of the paper on WhatsApp, while pupils from a school where Khoza teaches received a hard copy.The State is arguing in the Giyani Magistrate's Court against Khosa's bid to be released on bail.The bail application is continuing on Thursday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
