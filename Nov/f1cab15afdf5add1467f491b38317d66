Negotiations continue," Gift of the Givers said.It said it was informed by the captors that they would send proof of life via video soon.The organisation added that the situation was tense after the local elections of November 20 in the north were rejected."Polling stations were attacked and bombs have exploded everywhere. The situation is tense but the efforts continue right now on the Algerian border," it said.Since the organisation started negotiating for the two, it has emphasised that it has no ransom money to pay.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
