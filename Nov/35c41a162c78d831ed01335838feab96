The ANCYL would like to inform young people of the province that president Zuma is very much alive and present. The office of comrade Kebby Maphatsoe has informed us that comrade Kebby is not aware nor has he been invited to such an event."Tom cautioned activists against misusing the name of the ANCYL in the province and the names of party leaders. Having cautioned against such conduct Tom, however, indicated that they were inspired by the level of creativity shown by the activists in the province."It is through energy, creativity, proactive thinking and a passion for the ANC even during challenging times that vibrant ANCYL structures can be built. We encourage our activists to utilise our organisational channels to submit their ideas for ANCYL programmes at branch, zonal, sub-regional, regional and provincial level," he said.Tom indicated that the structure was working towards an ANCYL programme to be addressed by Zuma, the president of the ANC Women's League Bathabile Dlamini, the president of the ANCYL Collen Maine and Maphatsoe.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
