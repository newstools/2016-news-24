Chevon Booysen @Chevonbooysen In a bid to boost crime prevention in the area, surveillance cameras are planned for a section along Victoria Road in Grassy Park.Fuad Titus, chairperson of the Grassy Park Community Policing Forum (CPF), says they are happy about the prospect of CCTV cameras along Victoria Road, but says the CPF has not yet been formally consulted. Nothing has been formally discussed yet with the ward councillor and a meeting has been set up to discuss the possibility of surveillance cameras for the area. The only issue is that it cannot be done in isolation of the CPF. The CPF has a global view of safety and security concerns in our community and, so far, I was made to understand that neighbourhood watches have been told about the plans, Titus says. He says the neighbourhood watches have smaller areas of responsibility in terms of crime in pockets within Grassy Park, but a discussion on safety and security in Grassy Park needs a global view . We are very happy to engage with the councillors when it comes to safety and security and we have already set up a site visit with the councillor to ensure that they understand the needs of a specific area in Grassy Park. Victoria Road cuts across a lot of wards and if each councillor does this without consultation with the respective structures we could sit with a problem at the end of the day, Titus explains. These things need to be properly planned so that criminals can t find loopholes and crime is effectively and efficiently addressed. We already have cameras up in the area and our councillors will be taken to these spots on the site visit. As long as the people on the ground are engaged this can be a fruitful addition, Titus says.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
