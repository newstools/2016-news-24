Lili had already been escorted down a few floors when News24 reached the gallery doors.Western Cape ANC secretary Faiez Jacobs was one of the people gathered outside the gallery doors.He told News24 that Lili had apparently been kicked out after getting into an argument with a Democratic Alliance Students Organisation (Daso) member in the public gallery. Jacobs said he had heard that the Daso member had allegedly used a racial slur.Outside the gallery doors, security personnel vehemently denied that any slur had been used, saying that was not the reason for Lili's eviction.Another eyewitness, who did not want to be named, said it was unfair that Lili was the one kicked out.News24 spoke to Lili later outside a different entrance. He looked visibly disheveled, and was tucking in his T-shirt."The DA pretends they are doing well in Cape Town. I objected, and it was on that basis they threw me out," he said before re-entering the public gallery and sitting a distance away from the DA supporters.He did not mention the use of a racial slur.Earlier in the day, another unnamed person was also asked to leave by security personnel while MPs debated the need for a secret ballot.A person in the gallery is kicked out by security as MPs objections to secret ballot rage on. #NoConfidence @News24 pic.twitter.com/51EQGo4Xwp&mdash; Paul Herman (@PaulTHerman) November 10, 2016A person in the gallery is kicked out by security as MPs objections to secret ballot rage on. #NoConfidence @News24 pic.twitter.com/51EQGo4XwpThe debate continued and the motion of no confidence failed.People now arguing outside the public gallery over why the person was kicked out. #NoConfidence @News24 pic.twitter.com/bAqDnmRRnz&mdash; Paul Herman (@PaulTHerman) November 10, 2016People now arguing outside the public gallery over why the person was kicked out. #NoConfidence @News24 pic.twitter.com/bAqDnmRRnzDA leader Mmusi Maimane's introduction to #NoConfidence notion. @News24 pic.twitter.com/aEJvdoeItv&mdash; Paul Herman (@PaulTHerman) November 10, 2016DA leader Mmusi Maimane's introduction to #NoConfidence notion. @News24 pic.twitter.com/aEJvdoeItv24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
