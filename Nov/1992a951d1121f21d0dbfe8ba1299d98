The location was most convenient, as most of the members of the executive who attended the meeting were already at the venue for other commitments."Due to the urgency of the situation the meeting thus took place at this venue."Masutha reiterated that the purpose of the meeting was to address the rapidly "degenerating" situation at university campuses during fees protests that week.A protest at Wits University turned into a riot in the streets of neighbouring Braamfontein later that day.Gordhan charges not discussed"It was deemed prudent to return the appropriate state intervention to stabilise the situation as buses were burning, shops were being looted, streets were barricaded, buildings and vehicles were being vandalised and harm was inflicted on persons."He also repeated that pending fraud charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, who would be charged by Abrahams the next day, were not discussed at the meeting.Zuma had already been informed about the charges beforehand, and it was therefore "not necessary" to discuss it again at the meeting, he said.Constitutional law expert Pierre de Vos said that week that Abrahams had no business visiting the ANC's offices for a meeting as it created perceptions of bias and political interference.Gordhan was on October 11 charged with two counts of fraud for allegedly authorising an early retirement payout for his then-deputy Ivan Pillay during his tenure as Sars commissioner.Abrahams withdrew the charges three weeks later after Gordhan's co-accused, Pillay and former Sars official Oupa Magashula, made representations to the National Prosecuting Authority, who concluded that their conduct was not unlawful after all.Abrahams said the initial decision to prosecute was not his, following widespread criticism of alleged political interference in the case and calls for him to resign.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
