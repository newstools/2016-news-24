The workshop comprised four modules that were set with the aim of preparing youth from Mitchell s Plain for the workplace.The modules were work skills, people skills, money skills and entrepreneurial skills.Destiny Changers Difference Makers director Sandy Oorstendorp says: The modules have been designed specifically for unemployed young people between the ages of 16 and 35. This short course has so many benefits attached, such as how to compile a CV, how to prepare for an interview and more. The participants were also requested to submit a written assessment completed after each module. Those who are considered competent after the assessments are graded will be awarded a certificate by Absa.The workshop was facilitated by Graham Adams and Debbie Matthews of Absa.Mitchell s Plain was the first stop in the initiative.The team also took the workshop to Masincedane informal settlement yesterday to help bring the skills to the community there. Due to the demand for another workshop, we invite as many young people to attend the second Ready to Work facilitated course [this week], says Oorstendorp. V The workshop will be held at the Rehoboth Community Life Centre in Rocklands tomorrow from 10:00 to 13:00.
