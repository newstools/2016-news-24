Wynand complained that the investigation had been sparse and that she had received no request for the cellphone messages she and Fransman had exchanged, or for any other evidence.It transpired that the alleged harassment occurred in the Northern Cape, so the complaint was being investigated by authorities there. In the meantime, the ANC said Fransman would step aside as then Western Cape party chairperson, until the issue had been resolved.With other party members parachuted in to campaign in the province before the August 3 local government elections, there was confusion over whether he had been suspended or not. The party&rsquo;s poor performance in the polls was partly blamed on the Fransman issue.On November 10, the ANC said its national disciplinary committee had found Fransman guilty on two charges of misconduct and suspended his party membership for five years.The counts were for &ldquo;abusing his office for the purpose of attempting to obtain a sexual favour from Louisa Wynand, and for making public statements which brought the ANC into disrepute&rdquo;.Fransman, who did not attend his disciplinary hearing, rejected the findings. He questioned why potential witnesses were not interviewed, and claimed he had not received some of the documents he needed to defend himself. The ANC denied the latter claim.Since then, at least two ANC supporters close to him had called Wynand a liar and made sexually disparaging remarks about her and her father.One was from Northern Cape Bergsig region secretary Donovan Cloete, and another from Vanessa le Roux, an assistant to Fransman.In the meantime, the Congress of SA Students was set to go to the ANC's provincial headquarters in Cape Town to ask for Fransman's reinstatement. It wanted the ANC to stop treating them as &ldquo;strangers&rdquo;, and called for unity in the party.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
