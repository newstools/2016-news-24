The report said Mogoeng should decide which judge should head the commission.Speaking to journalists following a lengthy meeting with Parliament's committee on justice, Mogoeng said there was "no obligation whatsoever" for him to do anything.He said his role in terms of Madonsela's remedial actions was merely to facilitate the process, adding that when Zuma decided to exercise his powers to appoint an inquiry, he "may" do so."There is no obligation on us. Ours is more like a facilitative role," he said.Mogoeng added that relations between him and the president were healthy.He told journalists if there was perceptible tension between them, it was a healthy and democratic tension."In circumstances where you have different constitutional responsibilities, it does happen that you do things that are not too comfortable for other players in other arms of the state. When they manifest discomfort, it's healthy. Our relationship is very healthy; we talk to one another from time to time."Madonsela's findings were part of her 355-page report into allegations of improper influence by the Gupta family over Zuma and his family.Last week the Presidency announced that Zuma would be taking the State of Capture report on judicial review. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
