They were found on Tuesday.Cape of Good Hope SPCA spokesperson Belinda Abraham said local children found them when they climbed through the window of an abandoned house.The homeowner is believed to be in police custody for a separate matter and left the dogs locked inside when he was arrested.Police were at the house when an SPCA investigator arrived at the scene on Tuesday afternoon, Abraham said.The badly decomposed female dog&rsquo;s carcass was found in a bathroom. The puppies were found in the rest of the house, two of them decomposing under a mattress.It was suspected that the dog tried to drink water from the toilet.There was &ldquo;unspeakable filth and debris&rdquo; at the scene.&ldquo;This shocking case of animal abandonment is one of the worst we have encountered,&rdquo; she said.The organisation had no idea how long the animals had been in the house.&ldquo;But based on the level of decomposition, it has been some time since they passed away. How long they have been without water, food or anyone to care for them has not yet been established,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;The fact that the owner was arrested doesn&rsquo;t excuse him. He can give his explanations to the court to hear,&rdquo; she said.The SPCA was compiling a docket and was expected to lay criminal charges by Friday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
