The Midstream homeowners' association told the Oberholzers in 2014 that they were violating aesthetic and house rules with the structure.The association was eventually able to obtain an order against the Oberholzers in November 2015.The Oberholzers say the order against them was obtained incorrectly and in their absence. They did not know that the court case against them would go ahead.&nbsp;'Playhouse'They said in court papers that the "playhouse" was for their daughter, who has Down syndrome. It was meant to stimulate the child's sensory and motor skills, and was never meant to be a "Wendy house".However, the association said the crux of the matter is that the Oberholzers did not inform it in time that the structure was a playhouse for the child. The couple could have said so in a letter sent to the association on March 16, 2015.The association said the parties had agreed on October 20, 2015, that the Oberholzers would ask their daughter's occupational therapist to motivate for the structure staying on their property. A final decision would have been taken after the association received the report.The couple got the report on November 1, 2015, but only sent it to the association on November 30, despite knowing that the court case would be heard on November 6, 2015.The association said the Oberholzers are not ignorant people and are "the architects of their own misfortune". The sheriff served the order on them.Rules should apply to everyone&nbsp;The Oberholzers claimed in their review application that the parties had come to an agreement over the structure and that the court could therefore not have issued an order against them.However, the association said there had been no such agreement. Had that been the case, the court would not have ruled against the couple.The association says there are 1 571 houses on the estate and rules should apply to everyone.If people are allowed to build an illegal structure, proper reasons should be given, so that the decision is fair to all the residents.For this reason, it had been essential that the child's medical report be submitted by her parents on time.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
