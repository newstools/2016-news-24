They had also admitted security was sorely lacking.Disciplinary documents which detail how crimes were committed inside the Hawks building, the very offices where priority crime investigations are run from, were leaked to News24.The documents say the thefts happened between August and December last year and resulted in seven criminal cases being opened by Hawks members.The documents identify Chezlyn Daniels, previously a principal administration clerk based at the Hawks office, as allegedly masterminding the thefts.Laptops sold for R1 750He allegedly used a spare key to get into offices to steal equipment, including laptops and cellphones which were exhibits. Daniels, according to the documents, allegedly once stashed a camera stolen from a colonel's office behind a cabinet in a basement of the Hawks building.A laptop, allegedly also stolen from a colonel, was apparently found behind a cabinet next to Daniels' desk.His colleague, a data typist who went on to become a State witness, was said to have worked with him.The documents alleged, based on statements, that his colleague would "keep a lookout" while Daniels stole laptops, which were sealed in exhibit bags and which Daniels would later sell to a member of the public for R1 750 each.Daniels' colleague had denied receiving money from the proceeds of the laptop sales.This colleague alleged Daniels had asked him to approach a third colleague, Lonwabo Welem, in supply chain management "to work with them as he had access to the duplicate keys to all the offices&hellip; because Welem was already stealing".Suspension liftedBut, the documents said, Welem declined the offer.Welem was arrested on December 10 last year for allegedly stealing hard drives from a Hawks supply chain store.Daniels was also arrested on December 10 last year.He is expected back in the Bellville Magistrate's Court on December 6.According to disciplinary documents, Daniels' colleague who turned State witness was suspended for six months ending on January 26.But News24 understands this was lifted under certain conditions.Ramovha confirmed to News24 that it was Welem and Daniels who had resigned while disciplinary processes into their activities were underway.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
