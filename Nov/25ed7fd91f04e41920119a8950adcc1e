We are committed to the safety of everyone who uses Uber. It is why we are constantly developing new technologies to ensure safety before, during, and after every ride."Driver-partners had access to a security number they could call if they felt unsafe, Allenberg said."We remain committed to engaging in an open and constructive manner with all relevant stakeholders on the future of mobility in South Africa." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
