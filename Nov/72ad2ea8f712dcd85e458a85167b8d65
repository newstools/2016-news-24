He had held her up at knifepoint while she was walking with the other children,&rdquo; Jackson said.The officer gave chase, caught the man, and called the girl&rsquo;s parents. Berea police were called to the scene.While the children had been brave to chase the armed suspect, Jackson said it was not advisable as it could have ended tragically.&ldquo;Parents sadly do need to speak often to their children about the risks of crime and to warn them not to use a cellphone or tablet while out walking as this makes them easy prey for criminals,&rdquo; he said.It was the second incident in recent weeks where children had been targeted in the streets. In the first case in Glenwood, criminals in a car robbed a group of children of their belongings.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
