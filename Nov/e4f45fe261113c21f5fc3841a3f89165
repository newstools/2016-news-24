The country won independence from Sudan in 2011, with strong support from the United States.A peace deal between President Salva Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar in August last year had raised hopes of peace, until clashes erupted in Juba four months ago.The UN Security Council agreed to deploy a regional force to Juba to improve security, but the government in Juba has balked at the deployment of the 4 000 troops.In a separate confidential letter to the council obtained by AFP, Ban said Kiir's government had shown "piecemeal and limited consent" for the proposed regional force while continuing to impede UNMISS in its work on the ground.The council, which will discuss South Sudan on Thursday, has threatened to impose an arms embargo on South Sudan for its refusal to cooperate, but it has yet to take action."South Sudan is inundated with weaponry, which is often turned on defenseless civilians," Ban said in his report, adding that "under the present circumstances, stopping the flow of additional arms into the country is critical for the protection of civilians."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
