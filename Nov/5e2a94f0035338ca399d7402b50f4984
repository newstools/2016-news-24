But loyalist members of the army put an end to the putsch a week later.The minister said the three soldiers arrested for allegedly taking part in the coup were Roger Koussoube, Mohamed Zerbo and Wekouri Kosse.The former deputy chief of the presidential guard Moussa Nebie, known as "Rambo", and two other Burkinabe nationals who had sought refuge in Ivory Coast were sent back to Ouagadougou in February.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
