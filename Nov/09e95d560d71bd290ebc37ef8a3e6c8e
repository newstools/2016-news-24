The group is led by Ali Ndarass.The statement said the two groups would be "held responsible for the violence, particularly on civilians." It gave no details about any casualties.One of the world's poorest countries, CAR has been struggling to emerge from the aftermath of a civil war which erupted in 2013 following the overthrow of former president Francois Bozize, a Christian, by Muslim rebels from the Seleka coalition. Militias are flourishing, given the weakness of the state. The main groups are factions from the former Seleka and Christian "anti-Balaka" (anti-machete) militias, a reference to the rebels who use machetes.France, the former colonial power, last month withdrew a military mission it deployed in December 2013 to stabilise the country, leaving the UN's 12 500-strong MINUSCA peacekeeping mission to protect civilians from armed groups.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
