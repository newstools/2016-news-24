He has just released a documentary called Blood Lions, that sets out to expose the cruelties of the canned lion hunting industry in SA.WATCHJohannesburg &ndash; The Professional Hunters Association of South Africa (Phasa) says it will go to the Pretoria High Court to defend its decision regarding the hunting of lions bred in captivity.&ldquo;Phasa stands by its resolution to distance itself from captive-bred lion hunting and breeding, and will defend its captive-bred lions [CBL] resolution in court,&rdquo; said Phasa president Stan Burger.Phasa in a statement said its executive committee suspended the membership of those who continued hunting CBL.Those members have now legally challenged their suspensions.Phasa said that last year, the majority of its members voted in favour of the association&rsquo;s resolution to distance itself from captive-bred lion (CBL) hunting and breeding.Phasa said that the South African Predators Association (Sapa) had failed to convince it and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) of the conservation value of captive-bred lions.&ldquo;Members engaging in CBL activities would be in direct violation of Phasa&rsquo;s constitution, and would face an internal disciplinary hearing, which will end in dismissal if found guilty,&rdquo; said Burger.Burger said carnivore specialists believed the breeding of lions in captivity does not contribute to the conservation of the species.He said that the &ldquo;mere adherence&rdquo; to the minimum national and provincial legislative requirements of South Africa and Sapa norms did not give CBL shooting any credibility or &ldquo;social license&rdquo;.&ldquo;Captive-bred lion breeding and shooting does not uphold the moral principle that justifies responsible, ethical and legal hunting of wild lion (where the conservation value of hunting has been scientifically proven time and again) under the conditions of Fair Chase. For this reason, it is ethically indefensible and we will not support it,&rdquo; Burger said.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
