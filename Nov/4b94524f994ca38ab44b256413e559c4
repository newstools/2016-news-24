They were found in possession of firearms and police gear at a Sunninghill mall in Gauteng.The group was confronted in the basement of The Core Shopping Centre after security guards became suspicious of their vehicles. One of the vehicles had two number plates on top of each other.Upon searching the vehicles, two rifles, a handgun, ammunition, SA Police Service reflector vests, a cap and radio were found, along with a few other items.One of the men, Kagiso Ledwaba, an alleged associate of convicted drug dealer Radovan Krejcir, managed to escape from the Palm Ridge Magistrate&rsquo;s Court in March.Ledwaba escaped just days before being sentenced. A court orderly was charged with allegedly helping him escape.Ledwaba and his co-accused, Garland Holworthy and Thabo Mohapi, had been convicted of Gemballa&rsquo;s murder and kidnapping, and of theft.According to The Star, Gemballa was an associate of Krejcir and slain Teazers boss Lolly Jackson.A fourth accused, Thabiso Melvin Mpye, 29, entered into a plea agreement with the State, in which he admitted to kidnapping and killing Gemballa shortly after he arrived in South Africa on February 8, 2010. Gemballa's body was found in a shallow grave in Pretoria in October that year.In March 2011, Media24 Investigations reported that Krejcir allegedly boasted to his private doctor that he was behind Gemballa's murder.When Ledwaba escaped, he was appearing on a separate robbery and hijacking matter.The Hawks offered a R100 000 reward at the time for information leading to his arrest, but he remained at large.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
