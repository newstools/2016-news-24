I am very happy to have my life back again."She said she would take some time to reflect on the year and map out a new beginning for her family."We don't have any terrible or negative feelings towards the refugees. We wanted to help, but we just could not give them what they wanted. We just did not understand each other and things got complicated. We got caught in the middle of the situation."Lesson learntDespite everything that has happened to the family, Rae said they had no regrets and thanked everyone who assisted them and the refugees.She said some of the refugees had called to thank her family for trying to assist them in their time of need."It is unfortunate that the situation turned for the worst, but we certainly did not operate in a vacuum, there were so many people that assisted us."She said she had learnt a great deal from the situation."Next time, before I help someone, I will think twice before getting involved. I hope that does not make us cynical, but the problem here is that we had a humanitarian approach and the refugees had a political agenda."I think next time I will not get involved if the matter is political. It was good in the beginning and very bad at the end, but that's how life can be sometimes," Rae said.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
