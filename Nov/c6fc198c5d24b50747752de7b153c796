No patterned cornrows were allowed. Longer braids had to be tied back. No decorations or beads were allowed in the hair."No dyeing, bleaching, highlighting, colouring, colour washing, colour rinsing, or shaving of hair in any way is allowed."Singles/braids must be the same length and be the natural colour of the girl&rsquo;s hair. Longer braids must be tied back," the code read.Nowhere did the code specifically forbid an afro hairstyle.In addition, the girls claimed they were not allowed to speak in their mother tongue and that a teacher called them monkeys when they were singing and chanting in class.Lesufi said at the time that the school governing body would thrash out a new code of conduct, in consultation with pupils, and that there would be "a cessation of hostilities".He said it was important for the issues to be discussed.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
