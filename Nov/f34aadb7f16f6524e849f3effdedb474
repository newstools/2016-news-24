Both men were injured over the weekend when they hit a kudu while travelling to Port Elizabeth to testify in court.Stander indicated that he was in the process of securing other witnesses to come and testify and would be in a position to resume in the afternoon.Earlier Advocate Terry Price SC, for the defence, once again grilled Mayi about procedure in the arrest of alleged middleman Luthando Siyoni.Price questioned Mayi about when he had read Siyoni his rights, and if he had informed him of his right to refuse the police entry to his home and to refuse to point out the money that might implicate him in a crime.Price also asked Mayi about the injuries that Siyoni had sustained and asked him to explain, in detail, certain aspects around how he took down Babalwa Breakfast's statement, arrested Siyoni and warned Sizwezakhe Vumazonke.The trial continues.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
