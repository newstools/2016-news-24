We will do it by the book," he said.He assured officers that should Ipid investigate one of them, it would be a fair investigation, without "any interference"."We will not take instructions from anyone, no matter who they are. If necessary we will go to court to oppose the interference in the running of Ipid and telling us how we should decide on the outcomes of our investigations."We have done that at a great cost to ourselves and when there was a lot of silence in places that should have been a lot of noise."He warned police officers not to do "anything to get to the next rank"."It&rsquo;s your job to let people look at integrity more than rank. If you behave like a cartoon character - even though you have lots of stickers, you have no integrity."'Political vendetta'READ: Nhleko's request to Parliament for McBride disciplinary 'falls away'Earlier this month, McBride said he was taking legal advice on whether he would sue the state and Police Minister Nathi Nhleko for malicious prosecution.McBride made his first appearance before Parliament's portfolio committee on police since his suspension was lifted by the Constitutional Court in September.He and his team were reporting to MPs on progress in implementing the Auditor-General's 2014/15 recommendations for the department.After the meeting, McBride told journalists that he was considering a legal suit against the state.McBride said on Friday that the possibility of a "political vendetta" against him would not stop him from getting on with his job of investigating corrupt police officials.McBride was tight-lipped about the possibility of opening more cases against SAPS officials, but told News24 there were "quite a range" of investigations into which his department was looking.McBride returned to work on October 19, following a decision by the police committee not to institute disciplinary action against him.A request had been submitted by Nhleko for Parliament to institute disciplinary action against McBride, following September's Constitutional Court ruling that his suspension be declared invalid. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
