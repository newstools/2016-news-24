Police forensic expert Phillip Bekker was expected to return to the witness stand on Monday to be cross-examined by lawyers for Panayiotou, Sinethemba Nenembe and Zolani Sibeko. However, after a lengthy consultation in the judge s chambers on Friday, it was decided that the defence would instead use the day to familiarise themselves with a cellphone tracking report compiled for the State by former SAPS member and cellphone expert, Thereza Botha.&nbsp;ICYMI:&nbsp;Christopher Panayiotou did not look upset - witness&nbsp;Jayde Panayiotou's husband Christopher showed no emotion the day her body was found, a family friend told the High Court in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday. Pieter Bekker, who had been married into the Panayiotou family but then divorced, explained that when he heard Jayde went missing on 21 April 2015, he joined the search for her. She was a teacher at&nbsp;Riebeek College Girls'&nbsp;High School in Uitenhage.&nbsp;He told the court he first he checked with Christopher whether he and Jayde had&nbsp;argued and she had gone for a walk.&nbsp;ICYMI:&nbsp;Panayiotou internet lounge registered in employee's name&nbsp;Jayde Panayiotou's husband Christopher also owned an Internet lounge with gambling on the side in Port Elizabeth, but it was registered in an employee's name, the High Court heard on Thursday.
