On Sunday, an upbeat Maimane said they would appeal to all MPs to "vote with your convictions"."The nation has lost confidence in Jacob Zuma. Why are you shielding him?" he asked."I'm comfortable and confident that South Africa will rise."The DA's latest bid followed the release of former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's 'State of Capture' report on Wednesday.
