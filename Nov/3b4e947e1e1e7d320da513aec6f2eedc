It earned the party six seats in the National Assembly.The NFP was instrumental in helping the ANC increase its reach and take over municipalities which, until then, had been the stronghold of the Inkatha Freedom Party, by agreeing to form coalitions in those municipalities.She also made a rare public appearance in Vryheid in KwaZulu-Natal when the &shy;party launched its election manifesto in June, but was so weak that she was unable to deliver her keynote address. She is now able to walk without assistance but is still regaining her speech, which was affected by the stroke. Part of this interview was done in writing as she could not conduct lengthy &shy;verbal discussions. Despite her challenges, Magwaza-Msibi said she had been involved in party matters, providing necessary directives and giving guidance where needed. She stressed that the NFP was not a &ldquo;one-person party&rdquo; as the leaders of the national executive and national working committee were responsible for running party affairs.&ldquo;They have done tremendous work thus far,&rdquo; she said.She was full of praise for Zuma and his &shy;entire Cabinet: &ldquo;They have constantly checked on my progress and lent all the &shy;necessary support I needed during the &shy;entire time, something I am very grateful for.&rdquo; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
