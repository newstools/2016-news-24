We looked to his history, perhaps subjective, but we believe he is in a position to help the ANC... But there is no free lunch; as soon as he goes to power we will talk to him about what to deliver."'Cyril was not found guilty'Cosatu&nbsp;dismissed criticism of Ramaphosa after an email communication emerged during the Marikana Commission that he had pushed for government action to end the strike by the Associated Mine Workers Union (AMCU).Cosatu's second deputy president Zingizwa Losi said the commission of inquiry into the massacre, that left 34 miners dead after police fired at them in 2012, had not found Ramaphosa guilty.She said the criticism would be pushed by opposition parties who wanted regime change."You keep raising Marikana when (the)&nbsp;commission was put in place and Cyril was not found guilty. Things will be raised, it doesn&rsquo;t matter who leads the ANC, (this) war is not against individuals, but (against the)&nbsp;ANC. They want regime change."Cosatu would not comment on calls by its affiliates that Zuma must step down.It said it would rather engage with the ANC&rsquo;s national working committee.It had also not decided on who should be part of the Ramaphosa leadership team.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
