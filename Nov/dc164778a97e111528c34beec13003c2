	     Cape Town – A salary freeze for President Jacob Zuma, ministers and MPs, would save almost R100 million, the Independent Commission for the Remuneration of Public Office Bearers said on Friday. The commission recommended a zero salary hike for members of the executive, deputy ministers, MPs, provincial legislature members, judges, mayors and traditional leaders for 2017. Municipal councillors would get an increase of 4%. Magistrates and full-time members of the National House of Traditional Leaders would get 6%. The recommendation meant Zuma’s salary would remain at R2 874 851 in 2017.  A 6% inflation-based increase would have added over R97m to the public service’s salary bill.  The commission’s deputy chairperson, Matshego Ramagaga, said a number of factors were taken into consideration when making the decision. These included the responsibilities of the office bearers, affordability and inflation. There had been wide-ranging consultation with people including Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, Justice Minister Michael Masutha, Co-operative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen and Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng Gordhan and Mogoeng had raised concerns about the country’s economy. “The chief justice further indicated that given the state of the economy, the judges’ views were that they would sacrifice an increase in their own remuneration,” Ramagaga said. She said they had not received any formal objections from the affected sectors. Traditional leader Masenjana Sibandze said there had been a few complaints from the Congress of Traditional Leaders of SA. “The complaints...they have always been there. You can’t satisfy everybody,” he said.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
