Measures should immediately be implemented in residences to ensure such lapses were not repeated.Wits should have intervened to ensure the victim and alleged rapist did not continue living in the same residence."The report also recommends that executive management needs to act on previous recommendations and communicate more effectively on progress with regard to complaints of rape and/or gender-based harm that are reported within the university community," Habib said.Wits spokesperson Shirona Patel said a case had been opened against the alleged rapist with police.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
