The repeal of legislation ultimately lies with this House and not with the Executive," Democratic Alliance MP Werner Horn said.Horn questioned Masutha's rationale that there was a conflict between customary AU law to grant heads of state immunity, and South Africa's obligations to the Rome Statute and the ICC."The fact is: The Supreme Court of Appeal has clearly illustrated that there is no conflict. Our obligations to the Rome Statute must come first."He also said the AU's proposal for an African court had only been ratified by half the countries on the continent, and was not ready to replace the ICC.United Democratic Movement Chief Whip Nqabayomzi Kwankwa said the UDM agreed in principle with some of the reasons for withdrawing, but wanted to know what Cabinet's rush was in making the decision.He said government should have sought to transform the ICC first, and that withdrawal should have been a last resort.EFF 'suspicious' of ICCThe Economic Freedom Fighters which previously seemed to change their tune on the withdrawal, said that the party treated the ICC "with suspicion" in its current form."The ICC has shown bias and underhandedness in the manner they select which cases they try. Africa is a soft target for this judiciary body," EFF MP Sam Matiase said.Matiase though was concerned that the ANC "made a unilateral decision" without consulting Parliament or the judiciary, and should have asked for a referendum."While the ICC is not the best body to fill this space, it is irresponsible of the government to withdraw from it, thus placing itself under no oversight whatsoever."National Freedom Party MP Sibusiso Mncwabe said the party agreed with the ANC's decision, saying an African court will be better placed to try African heads of state.Masutha said a bill will be tabled before Parliament in due course to effect its withdrawal. The withdrawal will be complete within 12 months of the ICC receiving notice from the government.WATCH this video:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
