Michael ZoetmulderSOME of South Africa s top age group open water swimmers were in action this past weekend at Marina Martinique for Round 2 of the Swimming SA sanctioned EC Swim Series. Currently without any sanctioned open water swimming events in the Western Cape, the Series offers swimmers the closest opportunity of qualification for next year s SA Open Water swimming nationals.Sunday s warmer swim conditions didn t seem to favour Cape Town swimmers Rudolf Visser and Amy Barnes as they recorded slower 10km marathon swim times but were still well within the SA qualifying standard.Visser at 1hr 59min was a full minute slower than two weeks ago whilst Barnes in 2hrs 24min was some 5 minutes off the time set during that same race as she completed the last 2km of the race on her own.The top 3 finishers in the 5km swim were Cape Town s Gadi Friedman in 1hr 6min, just 1 second ahead of PE s Nicolas Adam with fellow Cape Townian Nicholas Campbell in 3rd place whilst JBay s Michell Strydom won the ladies race in 1hr 15min.The 1km swim saw George swimmer Sergio Manuel Dos Santos winning in a time of 12min 55sec from JBay s MC Strydom and Humansdorp s Alan Searle with PE swimmers Britney Brown (14min 58) and Tayla-Paige Lacey taking the top two medals in the ladies division ahead of Grahamstown swimmer Emma Podesta.In the very competitive 3km race there was a tie for first place between Port Elizabeth s Slater Black and Cullen Biddulph in a time of 37min 58sec with George s Sergio Manuel Dos Santos in 3rd place whilst in the ladies division it was Kirsten Marriott winning in a time of 38min 45sec ahead of Jessica Beukes and Cape Town swimmer Caylan Bromley. The wetsuit division was won by Katey Hofmeyer from Melanie Black whilst Stanford Slabbert won the 3km disabled category. In the social 500m swim it was Ruan Du Preez taking out the win from Chad Brown and Wayne Brown whilst Emma Lacey won the girls race from Elze Cilliers and Marany Jacobs.This coming Sunday sees swimming action return to Hobie Beach for Round 4 of the popular aQuell Ocean Racing Series with 7 events on offer including a 5km Beach Run, 5km Beach Walk, Kids (12u) 1km Beach Run and a 400m, 1km, 2km and 3km Ocean Swim.
