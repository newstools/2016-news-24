Zeena Ally of Superbody Club, assisted by Ansuya Maharaj, did an outstanding job not only in raising funds for cancer facilities, but also in putting across the message of awareness, early detection and survival. Twenty or so cancer survivors were present to give testimony that the disease can be overcome, especially if caught in the early stages.There were not too many present who chose the bald route in the shavathon, but there were plenty of men and women and youngsters walking round with bright touches of rainbow in their hair.Held in the new Greytown Feeding Project hall, this charity also benefitted through selling food to the many present.In an interview with the Greytown Gazette Zeena said the positive generous response from many businesses in the area, and individuals, had been overwhelming resulting in close to R20 000 being raised to be donated to cancer facilities.One of the highlights was the talk and slide show given by The Expeditionists, Thommo Hart and Simphiwe Ngcobo on their now famous walk to Maputo in the steps of John Ross.This was the fifth cancer awareness annual function to be held in Greytown and the talk is that the 2017 event will be even bigger and better. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
