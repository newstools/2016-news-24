Alternatively, this has resulted in an accumulation of&nbsp;historic debt at many institutions. The historic debt is part of the current fee crisis."Until a substantial degree of self-funding has been achieved the state should provide bridging finance, it said.&nbsp;The presidency has given the commission until June 30, 2017, to finalise its report.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
