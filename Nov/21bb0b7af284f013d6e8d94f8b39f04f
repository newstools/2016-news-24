But if the UN Security Council is going to apply its mandate in a manner that creates suspicion or selectivity, I don't think it has any positive impact on international criminal justice, quite honestly."'Engage with the politicians'READ: What would make SA 'flip-flop' on ICC withdrawal?He said it was not hard to imagine how the relationship with the security council and entire ICC system was affected, when a request by a 54-member bloc to defer proceedings and cases in Africa was "not considered or responded to".The way the court was currently set up, and how it applied the principle of complementarity (complementing existing national justice systems), lead to more cases coming out of the Africa, he said."Does it protect powerful interests? Who knows. These are the things we need to look at it."He said the AU continued to co-operate with the court on a technical level, by bringing both politicians and technical experts of member states to workshops.This should escalate to a more political level, rising above a debate on technicalities and academics."You need to engage with the politicians. They are the decision-makers. Until they are brought into this discussion, we are not going to move anywhere."Iyanda was asked about the mood in the AU after SA, Gambia and Burundi indicated they would withdraw from the court and its founding treaty.Other African states had shaken the notion of a united continental front by affirming the role of the court, or believing there was space as a member to fix issues.He responded to News24 by saying every organisation had individuals with different views.The AU's members were sovereign states who were best placed to speak on their own reasons and concerns."Of course, some of those concerns have been collectively conveyed by the African Union through its decisions, so I can't speak as to whether there would be mass withdrawals."He said the mood at the AU, as always, was one of a "big family".WATCH this video:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
