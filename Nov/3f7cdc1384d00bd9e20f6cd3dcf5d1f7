It seems, therefore, that the president intends, for reasons he has not explained, to draw out and delay the process unnecessarily and unlawfully,&rdquo; the two organisations said in a statement on Friday.This was in reaction to an affidavit Zuma had filed, in which he asked them to give him time to consider the matter. Zuma said in court papers that the two organisations&rsquo; application was an abuse of court process and premature. They had to allow him to get representations from Abrahams and two of his colleagues before taking a decision.On Tuesday, the Presidency said Zuma has asked Abrahams, director of public prosecutions Sibongile Mzinyathi, and acting special director of public prosecutions Torie Pretorius to provide reasons in writing why they should not be suspended and face an inquiry into their fitness to hold office. FUL and the HSF said it was clear Zuma would not meet Monday&rsquo;s deadline, which he had set to make a decision on the suspensions and inquiries.They said the three prosecutors would get a chance to state their cases once the inquiry got underway, and that they had already done so in lengthy answering affidavits.They argued that Zuma, despite his long affidavit, failed to explain why the suspension should not go ahead.The trio&rsquo;s suspension and inquiries became necessary after the aborted prosecution of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, former Sars commissioner Oupa Magashula, and Sars senior executive Ivan Pillay.On October 11, Abrahams announced that the three would be charged with fraud. This was related to their approving early retirement for Pillay in 2010, before rehiring him on a contract.Abrahams announced on October 31 that the charges would be withdrawn.The charges were &ldquo;insupportable and trumped-up&rdquo; and would have had disastrous consequences for the administration of justice and the economy, the FUL and HSF said.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
