Bruising? No problem! 2M's makeup artist has a miracle product!" wrote yet another.The channel's management issued a statement calling the broadcast sequence "completely inappropriate", and offered its "most sincere apologies for this error, given the sensitivity and seriousness of the subject".In a commentary posted Monday on worldwide efforts during 2016 to stem violence against women, Human Rights Watch acting women's rights division director Janet Walsh wrote that Morocco was "still discussing a draft domestic violence law".The New York-based HRW has said that violence against women is common in the North African country.It said an official study in 2009-2010 found that almost two thirds of Moroccan women had been physically, psychologically, sexually or economically abused, and that of those, some 55 percent said they had suffered domestic violence.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
