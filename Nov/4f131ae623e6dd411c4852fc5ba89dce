Watch Video below According to the Sun, the duo were enjoying their time at the sun loungers at the villa in Lake Kariba. Brendan Fowler, 27, who was inside the pool when the unfortunate incident occurred said that survival instincts kicked in when he realised that the crocodile had just jumped into the pool . "The croc pretty much flew over my shoulder and I saw it before it got into the pool. "From my angle it looked as if it was going to come at my face, so I turned and got out the way," Fowler was quoted as saying. In the video posted on social media, Fowler could be seen escaping from the pool, leaving his friend Amilia Roberts, 22, to fend for herself. Follow News24 Africa on Facebook and Twitter. As Amelia tried to reach the other end of the pool - seemingly to make it to safety, the crocodile suddenly became more aggressive, thrashing about in the water and latching onto her arm. She, however, only suffered minor injuries to her elbow, shoulder and back. This was not the first time that a crocodile attacked humans in the southern African country. In October last year, a crocodile tore a 5-year-old away from her mother in a terrifying attack in Harare's dormitory town of Chitungwiza. Ruvarashe Matingwina was reportedly holding onto her mother's hand as they crossed the Nyatsime River on their way home when the crocodile grabbed the child's leg. The mother was reported to have screamed for help but her child's body was only found in reeds in Chitungwiza a day after the attack.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
