The accident also caused major bottlenecks during peak hour traffic.Most of the other passengers sustained minor injuries and were suffering from shock. Paramedics triaged patients on the scene, checking their backs and legs, and seeing if they had been cut by broken glass.Transport MEC Brett Herron said that at about 8:20, the D04 from Kapteinsklip in Mitchells Plain drove into the T01 from Dunoon and Table View, which was&nbsp;parked at the Civic Centre. The impact led to the T01 crashing into the A01, which operates the airport route. The passengers on the T01 bus had already disembarked at the time of the incident,&nbsp;but the A01 bus had a few passengers on board. The D04 was full."I sincerely wish all of those who were injured a speedy recovery. I once again want to assure the MyCiTi commuters that we will hold those responsible accountable," said Herron.&nbsp;The suspended driver would also face a disciplinary inquiry, and Herron expected an accident report from the transport company operating the Mitchells Plain to Civic Centre route by November 11.Police would also investigate."The safety of our passengers is non-negotiable," said Herron. These findings and the police report would help prevent a similar accident in future.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
