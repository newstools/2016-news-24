With it is a sexually crude message about the teacher. In the text he names the teacher and describes a sex act, Netwerk24 reported.He also wrote: &ldquo;... We have to protect Helpies pupils against this sick fuck...&rdquo;The teacher only realised something was wrong when she noticed that some pupils were laughing at her while other would come up to her and hug her. One asked her if she was OK.Eugene Marais, the school&rsquo;s acting principal while Klaus K&ouml;nig is abroad, told Netwerk24 that disciplinary action had been taken against the young man.Marais said a meeting had been held with the parents to find the best possible solution to the problem.It had been in the boy&rsquo;s best interests to write the exam, although he strictly-speaking wasn&rsquo;t a pupil at the school anymore, Marais said.&ldquo;This isn't a run-of-the mill situation. You don&rsquo;t understand the circumstances of the child and his parents,&rdquo; Marais said.He didn&rsquo;t want to elaborate.The teacher is said to be shattered by the incident.A source told Netwerk24 that the teacher, who&rsquo;d been in the profession for years, felt humiliated. &nbsp;&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t know the child and has never spoken to him.&rdquo;Both K&ouml;nig and Marais wanted to know why it had been necessary to write the story and wouldn&rsquo;t comment before getting a comprehensive explanation from the journalist.&nbsp;K&ouml;nig said he &ldquo;is an educator, not a policeman&rdquo; when asked about disciplinary measures against the now ex-pupil.&ldquo;The parents were sad but understanding when we called them in immediately after the incident had been brought to our attention.&rdquo;No further steps were taken, K&ouml;nig said, adding "You can write he was suspended.
