The women believed that political leaders have failed students, and have fuelled a "deepening" cycle of violence.The group of women included singer Yvonne Chaka Chaka and businesswoman Zanele Mbeki, wife of former president Thabo Mbeki.They called on the SA Human Rights Commision and the Independent Police Investigative Directorate to investigate instances of unprovoked violence against studentsCampuses across the country came to a standstill shortly after Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande announced on September 19 that universities could determine their own fee increases for 2017, as long as they did not exceed 8%.The poor and "missing middle" would not have to pay the increase.
