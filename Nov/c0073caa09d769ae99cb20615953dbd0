It is understood that the fire started at some point on Monday night in a finance office on the campus. The campus has been a flashpoint of violence, arson and protest action during the campaign against tertiary education fees.UKZN spokesperson Lesiba Seshoka said that at this point it was too early to link the fire to protesting students. "There was a fire that was confined to a single finance office, which was later extinguished. The police have been doing their investigation all day to try and understand what caused the fire," he said. "We cannot say for certain it is linked to free tertiary education protests, but this is something that the police will investigate. We have had no protests for the past six weeks," he said. On the campus, parts of a residence and an exam hall have been razed by fire. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
