The Palm Beach Post reports that 19-year-old Austin Harrouff replied when deputies asked what he ate, he replied "humans." The Post says court records obtained Monday show Harrouff begged deputies to kill him after they pulled him off John Stevens' body. Harrouff is charged with second-degree murder in the August 15 attack on Stevens, 59, and his 53-year-old wife, Michelle Mishcon, outside their Tequesta home. Prosecutors say they will ask a grand jury to indict him on first-degree murder charges. That would make him eligible for the death penalty. Tests to determine whether Harrouff was on drugs are underway. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
