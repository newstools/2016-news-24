ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu on Thursday said absent members, including ministers and deputy ministers, would be sent to disciplinary hearings after they did not show up in the House. The Division of Revenue Bill was first debated in the National Assembly on Tuesday, but could not be passed as there were not enough members in the House during the voting session. The passing of the bill again failed on Wednesday, when 193 MPs voted in its favour, and five against.&nbsp; After a three-hour meeting on Thursday, the ANC caucus has taken full responsibility for the incidents. Mthembu said 209 MPs had confirmed attendance on Wednesday, and yet there were less than 200 in the National Assembly.He said the names of the MPs, which would not be released, would be forwarded to the Caucus Disciplinary Committee.They are to be charged and a disciplinary hearing would be initiated without delay.&ldquo;The absence of these MPs, despite recorded confirmation that they will be present, is disgraceful and downright disrespectful to the people of South Africa.&rdquo;Mthembu has called for the process to be conducted swiftly.&ldquo;The public deserves representatives that take their Parliamentary tasks seriously and demonstrate a commitment to serve. MPs who repeatedly demonstrate scant regard for the duties entrusted to them by the electorate must make way for those who are prepared to serve with dedication.&rdquo;The two sittings had been declared three line whip, making it compulsory for the MPs to attend.Mthembu said they would schedule the Division of Revenue Bill for next week again. &ldquo;And we will pass it. The MPs will be there.&rdquo; The MPs in the hot seat are any who had been absent on Tuesday and/or Wednesday without leave.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
