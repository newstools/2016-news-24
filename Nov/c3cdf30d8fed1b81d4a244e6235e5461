Half of them had been employed in the past three months.Less than half of the men had finished high school and nearly half did not have enough food.According to the study, the majority of men interviewed had experienced at least one type of physical or sexual abuse as children."More than one-third had been raped or molested as a child, and more than half of the men experienced one or more adult traumas such as witnessing a rape or murder or being tortured, raped, or robbed at gunpoint.&rdquo;More than half (56%) of the men interviewed said they had either raped or beaten a woman in the last 12 months.The study revealed that 60% committed multiple acts of violence against women during that period.&nbsp;"One-third of men believe that wives should not be able to refuse sex.
