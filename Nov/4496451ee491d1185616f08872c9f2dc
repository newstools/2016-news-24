Joshua said this during a service at the headquarters of his church in Lagos. "There is nothing controversial about the prophecy. It is human beings that are controversial... We are not on the same level (of spiritual understanding)."&nbsp;See his post on Facebook below.Social media reaction TB Joshua today in church trying to explain the female president he saw. pic.twitter.com/3XRwPlJrL2Church members today when TB Joshua tried to explain who the female president was pic.twitter.com/BM6cBgW8g7&mdash; Gitz (@iGitz_) November 13, 2016Church members today when TB Joshua tried to explain who the female president was pic.twitter.com/BM6cBgW8g7TB Joshua: When I said I saw a female president I meant Melania Trump, I saw her in white house Church members: pic.twitter.com/UdwZkYvXMD&mdash; Gitz (@iGitz_) November 13, 2016TB Joshua: When I said I saw a female president I meant Melania Trump, I saw her in white house Church members: pic.twitter.com/UdwZkYvXMDTB Joshua says when he spoke of Hillary Clinton winning the elections; he was referring to the popular vote &amp; that people misunderstood him. pic.twitter.com/JPrZwZ85i7&mdash; Olwethu Sipuka (@osipuka) November 14, 2016TB Joshua says when he spoke of Hillary Clinton winning the elections; he was referring to the popular vote &amp; that people misunderstood him. pic.twitter.com/JPrZwZ85i7When you get to church on Sunday &amp; TB Joshua starts prophesying pic.twitter.com/6jbl70cNI4&mdash; Yoruba Boy Not Demon (@iam_tomilade) November 11, 2016When you get to church on Sunday &amp; TB Joshua starts prophesying pic.twitter.com/6jbl70cNI424.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
