(Jenna Etheridge, News24)Botswana&rsquo;s attorney general Athaliah Molokomme said justice and accountability would continue to dominate the continental discourse this year. She was optimistic about the African State parties as long as dialogue remained open.For dialogue to take place, there had to be respect, trust and mutual understanding, underlined Algerian diplomat Fatiha Serour.Putting a positive spin on recent developments, she said: &ldquo;The more concerns, and resistance and hesitation we have from some, the more resolve we have from others to actually pursue justice and accountability in Africa and other continents.&rdquo;Unique legal challengesGoldstone said South Africa&rsquo;s case had raised &ldquo;unusual and unique legal challenges,&rdquo; which would be tested by the High Court in Johannesburg in December.&ldquo;What is being sought is an order compelling the South African government to withdraw their withdrawal and to give appropriate notice.&rdquo;However, he believed such an order would not result in government being thwarted in leaving the Rome Statute, but delay it at most.This was in light of a bill before Parliament for the repeal of domestic legislation incorporating the provisions of the Rome Statute.&ldquo;I think we are in for a fairly extended period of debate in South Africa in respect of the courts and in respect of Parliament. There is a lot of water yet to flow under the bridge in the meantime.&rdquo;At worst, government would have to give a new notice of their intention, and their final withdrawal could be delayed to 2018, not next year.Nigerian legal expert Dapo Akande said the direction the court was taking mattered more than where it was at present.&ldquo;We always have to keep working at it,&rdquo; he said referring to various structural difficulties.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
