Lynn.HitchcockAS the silly season approaches the Hillcrest police warn the community to be extra vigilant and not become victims of pickpocketing, theft and remote jammers, especially while shopping.Police spokesperson for Hillcrest SAPS Constable N. Manqele said criminals often target when shopping malls are busy and criminals have easy access to handbags. Criminals also target small businesses when they know they will be paying staff wages or bonuses. These businesses pay their workers directly and they often become targets of criminals. We urge businesses to arrange that their workers wages are paid into their bank accounts. It is not advisable to carry large sums of money in public and the community need to exercise precautionary measures when shopping, Manqele said. Do not let anyone assist you at an ATM and be aware of your surroundings, he said. Do not leave valuable items like laptops, cash, phones in the car, and when you lock your car double check that it is properly locked by pulling the handle. Manqele said SAPS receive a high volume of cases where people are being remote jammed while shopping. If you see any suspicious action around shopping centre parking lots, contact the police immediately before you being the victim of crime. To report cases of theft, SAPS can be contacted on 031 765 9124. - Supplied.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
