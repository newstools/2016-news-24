I assisted Noxi, so I ended up working that day.LS: I'm not sure if he made the call or if Noxi called him from Infinity, but Noxi spoke to Chris and she told Chris I was there.LS: Chris told her that she must give me the phone. On the phone he told me that he was happy that I was there.LS: I told him to stay strong, I would stay at Infinity till closing.

So I asked how do I get the money.LS: She said that she had tried to get hold of Chris telephonically but was unable to get hold of him.MS: I want to stop you there. At that stage, did you have no money to pay Sizwe in your possession?LS: I had money but not the full amount.LS: I told Sizwe he was going to get his money, but I must go fetch the money.MS: Where were you going to fetch the money?LS: At Infinity.MS: And then?LS: I first went to gym, then I walked to Infinity.LS: When I got there, Chris Panayiotou was not there.LS: And because Chris said to me that when I need the money he would leave the money in Noxi's care.MS: Do you know where the owner lived?LS: No I just went to a house with a garage.MS: Where was this?LS: New Brighton.MS: So the best you can give us is that the R10 000 was given back to accused number one, the month before your arrest?LS: Yes.MS: What happens. It's clear Sizwe wants his R10 000, so what do you do?MS: Were you and Sizwe ever in business together?LS: He was a friend.MS: Were you ever in business together?LS: No I don't recall.MS: Before I move on from the weights, do you know who they belonged to, you said Sizwe is the middleman.LS: He said it was his friend.MS: Do you know who the friend was?LS: I don't know the name.MS: When was this?LS: After I saw the weights sold to me were small, and they were not worth R40 000.MS: When, when did you take the R20 000 back?LS:I used R10 000 for me, and the other R10 000 I took back to him.MS: I want to know when you speak that day, what arrangement did you make?LS: I said I would pay the balance.LS: But the money was not in my possession.MS: So when he called, you did not have the money in your possession?LS: Yes.MS: Where was the remaining R20 000?LS: I took half the R20 000 back to my boss to save it again.MS: And how much had you paid for the weights?LS: I had paid R20 000, and kept R20 000.MS: So Sizwe asked for the balance?LS: Yes.LS We were cheating each other. I think he had a commission to sell, I thought that when I paid the R20 000, he was not going to demand the extra R10 000.MS: So he now wants the extra R10 000?LS: It was not the first time for him to make a phonecall, but sometimes I would avoid him.LS: Then I went to look at the weights, but I was not satisfied with the quality of the weights so I kept some of the money.MS: Where does Sizwe fit in?LS: Sizwe was selling weights that belonged to a friend of his to me.MS: Right, so Sizwe was acting as a middleman, selling weights on behalf of a friend?LS: Yes.MS: And the balance he was looking for?LS: It was R10 000.MS: You called him back?LS: Yes I called him back.MS: And what was his concern?LS: He was calling about the balance.MS: So Vumazonke wanted money from you?LS: That was money for weights my lord.MS: You must help me, I am not a gym man.MS: You must explain, that is money for weights, you must tell us.LS: When I told my friends to look for weights, I told them to look for bargain weights.LS: Sizwe.MS: Vumazonke, your friend?LS: Yes.MS: Missed calls, more than one?LS: Yes.MS: Do you remember how many?LS: two or three.MS: Not more than that?LS: I am not sure, it could be more.MS: What happened before 11:00?LS: That morning I was with my girlfriend.LS: When I got up I saw some missed calls.LS: Then I called back.MS: Lets stop there, who did you receive the missed calls from?&nbsp;LS: My friend.MS: Which friend?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;MS: Okay, now let's go to the morning.MS: Lying in bed, what happens next?LS: I got up and went to Infinity.MS: I'm trying to break it down to timeframes.MS: What time did you go to Infinity?LS: It was around 11:00, after I had been to the gym.MS: Okay, I want to go back to before 11:00.MS: Time?LS: I was told late around 19:00.MS: Late?LS: But I did go to Infinity in the morning.MS: I think we missing each other. What time did Phumlani call you to tell you to come work?LS: It was late, around 7pm or 6pm.MS: When he called you?LS: Yes.LS: She said I must come to work.LS: I'm not sure if it was after or before the deceased went missing.LS: I remember going to Infinity.MS: Do you know from which number Phumlani called you?LS: It was his personal cellhone number.MS: Do you know what time?LS: It was late.MS: I want to take you to the 21 April 2015.MS: To put you in the picture, that is the day Jayde went missing.MS: Can you recall the events of that day?LS: I received a call...LS: I was at the gymLS: And Phumlani was the one who called me.MS: After you received the money, how much was left?MS: With Chris?LS: there was about R6 000, or R9 000.MS: In that last month did you continue saving?LS: Yes.MS: And the R40 000 you ha d received from Chris, what did you do with it?LS: I bought the weights and kept the other money.MS: How was the money packed?LS: I received the money in a bag.MS: What type of bag?LS: In a financial bag.MS: A money bag?LS: Yes &nbsp;a money bag.MS: And that was about a month before your arrest?LS: That is right.MS: And why did you take the money?LS: A friend came to me with a bargain price for weights for the gym.LS: I received such a call from a friend. I asked Chris for the money.MS: Did you receive the money?LS: I went to fetch it.MS: Who gave it to you?LS: That was Chris.MS: All I want to know, was it March 2015 , was it December 2014?MS: When did you get the money back?LS: About a month before.MS: Before your arrest?LS: that is correct.MS: And was it all of the money?LS: No about R40 000.MS: How did the money end up in accused number one's possession?MS: Maybe I give you an example, did you only take a certain amount of your pay and he kept the rest. or did you physically take him other money?LS: Sometimes I would leave my wages in his care, some other money I would take to him.MS: So if you are saying it was somewhere between R46 000 and R50 000, when was that?LS: After he became my friend.MS: How long before your arrest was this money still with accused number one?LS: After some time I was working at Infinity I had money before that, but I couldn't use money effectively. That is when I discussed with Chris and whether it would be safe to save the money with Chris.LS: I am not sure of the amount of money.MS: According to your memory, how much money did you leave with Panayiotou?&nbsp;LS: It is between R46 000 or it may have been R50,000 I am not sure as I was still collecting the money.MS: So you are not sure if it was R46 000, R50 000, R52 000 or even R56 000?LS: I am not certain.MS: Now, when did you start this saving project of yours?LS: That was a while after I started working at Infinity.MS: And I understand you gradually saved up the money that was being kept for you.LS: It was not R30 000.LS: It was more than R30 000.MS: Can you tell us how much?LS: I wanted to buy some things. It was around R46 000, R52 000 or even R55 000.MS: Now, how did it come about that R30,000 came about ending up in possession of accused number one [Panayiotou]?LS: Accused number one was always coming to me at the gym, and was assisting me in saving money.LS: Because he observed that I cant save money.LS: Because I was complaining to him and asking him how he was doing with his business, because I can't buy one bag.LS: But I'd make money at the end of the month. Because he is also a business man, I trusted him and his advice was that I work for him so that I could save the money if the money was in his care.LS: That was the advice he gave me, that I must save the money before I use it.LS: So that I can buy something that I can see.MS: Where does the money come from?LS: It is savings from my work, as well as money from commissions and money from friends who support me.MS: Did you ever keep your money at OK or Infinity?LS: Yes, at Infinity.MS: And the amount?LS: It was more than R30 000.MS: And how did more than R30 000 end up at Infinity?LS: Because I trusted my boss and he had the money in safe keeping for me because I was wasting the money.MS: I am going to return to this at a later stage.MS: Mention was made of R30 000 which was in a black gym bag of yours.MS: Do you know of the R30 000 that was in the gym bag?LS: I do have knowledge. The money was in my gym bag.MS: Where does that money come from?LS: That was my savings.LS's leg is extended out of the box, foot kicking against the box.MS: So I want to check, is it your version that you never knew where Panayiotou stayed?LS: Yes that is correct.MS: Were you ever informed of people who stayed opposite accused number one's residence?LS: I would not know.MS: And you did not know?LS: No.MS: Prior to your arrest can you tell the court what vehicle Panayiotou was driving?LS: He was driving a Golf.MS: Do you know what he drove prior to the Golf?LS: He also had a bakkie.MS: Were you at any stage asked by anyone to find a contract killer?LS: No.MS: At no stage?LS: No.MS: Did you at any stage for any reason approach anyone to shoot someone else?LS: There is no-one my lord.MS: Were you ever involved by yourself or with other people, in renting a vehicle?LS: Never.MS: Did you ever contribute to the rental of a vehicle for anyone?LS: No.LS asks if he can sit down.MS: Was it before or after your arrest that you asked about the price of a rental vehicle?LS: It was prior to my arrest.MS: And how long prior you arrest?LS: I cant recall exactly, It was about three months or four months.LS: It was quite a long time before my arrest.MS: Are you sure about this, are you sure it could not perhaps be three weeks before?LS: I am not sure.MS: So you saying you don't have a friend named Touch who is a neighbour at the gym?LS: No I don't have such a friend.MS: Did you ever enquire at a car rental place, the price of renting a vehicle?LS: Yes.MS: And at which company did you ask for a price?LS: Ntando.MS: Do you know when?LS: I don't recall clearly.MS: Do you know a person named Touch?LS: Yes I have such friends.MS: One of them being a neighbour at the gym?LS: No.MS: So you never physically went as far as trying to rent a car?LS: No.MS: Did you ever go to the trouble of finding numbers for car rental companies?LS: I think a person once asked me for such a number and I promised I would look for such a number.MS: Did you send such a number to someone else?LS: It seems so.MS: To who?LS: I'm not sure.MS: Do you know how to drive?LS: I can't drive.MS: Did you ever at any stage ever want to rent a vehicle?LS: Yes I once had a wish to have a rental vehicle, but the problem is that I am unable to drive.MS: Where did you want to get obtain this vehicle?LS: I had a wish, nothing more.
