Watch. WATCHCape Town &ndash; Hair and jewellery regulations will be the same for boys and girls at a high school in Cape Town after the school decided to take out any reference to gender in its policy.This followed extensive consultation with parents and pupils who came out strongly in favour of change.Westerford High School Principal Rob le Roux said the changes for 2017 were made during a governing body meeting two weeks ago.&ldquo;Boys will be allowed to wear ponytails, as long as it is tied back, clipped and neat,&rdquo; he told News24 on Wednesday.Man-buns were also an option, again, if abiding by the tidy and clean rule.&ldquo;There is nothing about any ethnicity in our rules at all. Braids, cornrows and afros will be allowed as long as neat and tidy.&rdquo;Single studs or sleepers were allowed in the bottom hole of the earlobe.&nbsp;Wanted changeFashion statements would not be the order of the day.Le Roux said children at the school in Rondebosch had wanted to change the uniform regulations &ldquo;forever&rdquo;.The school started with a uniform revision survey last year, gathering opinion from pupils in class and parents online.That had resulted in the girls&rsquo; summer dress being phased out slowly for a golf shirt and skirt or skort.The principal said they were still working out the finer details of their changed policies, with input from staff, parents and pupils.He felt they were sailing into an exciting but unknown territory.&ldquo;We received loads of positive messages and one negative,&rdquo; he shared.The "negative" related to a parent not being asked for their opinion beforehand, even though the survey was available.&ldquo;There was encouragement that we are bold, progressive and listening to children,&rdquo; Le Roux said of the other feedback.&ldquo;Ultimately the parent makes the decision.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
