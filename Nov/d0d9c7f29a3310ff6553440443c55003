Moyo said that he was a victim of "succession politics".&nbsp;The minister also claimed that Zacc had abandoned its own constitutional mandate of being an independent graft fighting unit.Earlier this month, he handed himself to Zacc after he admitted through a series of tweets that he had diverted the Zimdef funds to his constituency, said a Chronicle report.&nbsp;Zimdef funds were meant to support students at tertiary institutions, the report said.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
