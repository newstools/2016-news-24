People like Willem Oosthuizen and Theo Martins Jackson who were filmed forcing a black man into a coffin, threatening to douse him with petrol must be removed from society. This vicious demonstration of hatred against a fellow human being is shocking. This kind of mentality and behaviour should not be tolerated in our country.I m dumbfounded that in this day and age of discussion and advancement, there is still this element of racial division. What country we are building, where everyone is hated by someone else, is just a symptom of a deeply troubled society. Nobody should ever be treated like this and this behaviour is disgusting. Incidents like these should send a strong message to all racists. They can rather continue to be closet racists during their braais, but not in public. They must be made to feel that what they did is extremely wrong and it must also be a warning to those racists who continue to think that they are gods unto themselves. As South Africans, we need to unite to fight racism.SICELO FUNANIKuyasa24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
