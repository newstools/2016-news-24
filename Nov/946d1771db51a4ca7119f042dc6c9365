It is impossible for anyone to speak about the State of Capture report without reflecting on how unethical and disreputable Zuma's conduct has been in terms of the executive code of ethics," EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said in a statement.Madonsela had a right to speak about the report, Ndlozi said, and being a former Public Protector did not mean her freedom of expression and speech had to be suspended or violated."She ought to be considered fully as an ordinary citizen of this country who must, as all other citizens do, reflect on the work of the office of the Public Protector and Zuma himself."The party called on Madonsela to continue expressing herself on any matter published by the office of the Public Protector from before, during and after her tenure.Rise of post-colonial dictatorship"This is the cornerstone of our democratic practice that must never be violated. We are convinced that Zuma wants the matter to be buried in the public discourse so that he cannot suffer the public shame and humiliation his actions call for."Madonsela must make no apology for continuing to enlighten the public about what is contained in the State of Capture report, Ndlozi continued.Calling for Madonsela to cease speaking about the report was a sign of the rise of post-colonial dictatorship, the EFF said."The Presidency can all go and drown themselves in the free alcohol from the Saxonwold Shebeen and leave our constitutional democracy intact."The Presidency on Friday said Madonsela should "step back" and stop commenting on the report as she had no further role to play in the process."Her unwarranted public attacks on the president, as happened in Stellenbosch on Thursday, are unbecoming and are not helpful," said Presidency spokesperson Bongani Ngqulunga."It would be prudent therefore for the former Public Protector to step back and allow legal and constitutional processes to unfold unhindered." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
