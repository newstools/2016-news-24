We can take each other toe-to-toe."He first called on supporters to occupy unoccupied land on December 16, 2014 and made similar remarks in Newcastle in June during the party's freedom charter rally.Bosman also blamed the EFF for the Fees Must Fall unrest on university campuses."At these campuses the initial motive was support for the #FeesMustFall campaign, only later did it become an opportunity to encourage racial hatred," continued Bosman.Bosman said the EFF leadership would have to take full responsibility for inciting such rhetoric against white people.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
