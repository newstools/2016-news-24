Nigeria's military continues punishing raids that often target entire communities, civil society groups say.The Trans Forcados pipeline was bombed in July and only resumed operations two days ago, defying militant warnings that no repairs be carried out on attacked installations. The pipeline carries crude and gas to the 400 000-barrel-a-day Forcados export terminal owned by Dutch-British multinational Shell.That brief resumption allowed the oil ministry to announce Tuesday that production had increased to 2.1 million barrels a day. That's the highest since attacks began in February that at one point reduced production by a million barrels a day, throwing Africa's biggest economy into recession.Militants are demanding that oil multinationals leave the region, noting decades of careless production has destroyed fishing grounds and agricultural fields. The multinationals operate joint ventures in which Nigeria's government is a majority shareholder.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
