I ve done three corporate triathlons and have completed my first Makro. I have my own bike, wetsuit and running gear. The only thing that s missing is the affordability, as I am a family man of which my one son is currently at university. I thrive on fitness ever since I won our own in-house biggest loser competition in 2013. Needless to say, I have since then gone from couch potato to fitness fanatic, which has also enhanced my health and wellness.I am a 46-year-old male living the dream of one day entering for IRONMAN.
