Luthando Siyoni told the court how a sting operation was set up to get Christopher Panayiotou to confess in the murder of his wife, Jayde. Jump to bottom MS: Did you tell him your version of the events on the merits of this case?LS: I told him everything that happened to me.MS: Did you tell him your version of the events on the merits of this case?LS: No I told him about what happened to me.MS: Subsequent to Mr Scoltz, did you obtain any other legal representation?LS: Yes I got Mr Ngqeba.MS: After van der Spuy did you get further legal representation?LS: No.MS: Did you at any other stage consult with further legal representation?LS: When I observed that Van der Spuy was not doing the things for me, then I obtained other legal representation.MS: Who?LS: I am not sure [name not audible].LS: I obtained his services after I was detained at Humewood.MS: Did you tell him about the assault?LS: Yes.MS: Did you tell him your version of the events on the merits of this case?LS: I told him about the assault.MS: Did you tell him your version of the events on the merits of this case?LS: I told him I don't have an attorney and that I wanted an attorney for some time and I was never offered the opportunity to get an attorney.MS: Did you give him your version of events, excluding the torture?LS: I don't know whether I first of all I said Van der Spuy was not an attorney of my choice.LS: He was brought to me, and when he came to me, he had knowledge of what happened to me, because I recall making a statement to him and Kanna.LS: He was called to come and confirm what was written down was written down correctly.LS: Then Van der Spuy said what is written down is right and is going to serve its purpose.LS: To me, he was part of the team that was working with Kanna, including Stan - referring to Stander.MS: My question is very simple, did you tell Van der spuy your version of events?LS: No.LS: Because during that time if I report something to him, he won't come back to me.LS: Kanna would come back and everything was under his control, there was nothing that I could tell my attorney, which was in fact his.LS: I must not panic and give the attorney some versions.LS: If I want something, I must tell him, Kanna.LS: So that is why I could not tell Van der Spuy anything, because whatever I told him he would convey to Kanna.MS: So I can accept that your version of the torture was not conveyed to Van der Spuy?LS: No I did not tell him.LS: I must say I did want a lawyer and Kanna volunteered to get one as he said I can't be in court without a legal representative.MS: I want to know, was he ever your legal representative?LS: The manner in which he approached me I was under the impression was my attorney, then I realised he was not my attorney, he was acting as my attorney.MS: You have told us now how you were tortured, and you have given us your version of events on the facts of the case.LS: Yes.MS: Did you tell the version of events on the torture to Mr Van der Spuy?LS: As I said, he was not my attorney. When I got him, I realised he was working with Kanna.MS: Mr Siyoni at the time you made the first affidavit to the investigating officer, you referred to him as Kanna, did you have an attorney at that stage?LS: No the attorney was not present.MS: Did you have the services of an attorney at the time you made the statement to Kanna, on the 3rd of May 2015?LS: No I did not have an attorney.MS: Was Mr Van der Spuy at any stage your legal representative?LS: They said they had arranged with him to represent me, and I never asked about that.LS: Then we went to my house. I pretended to search for the money in my house, knowing that the money was not in the house because I wanted my family to see I was assaulted.LS: The police came in and searched the room. They said if I tried to run away, they would shoot me.LS: Then I told them the bag is not there, and we went to my girlfriend's house to look for it.LS: When we got there it was not there.LS: Then they asked, where is the money, and they were told that the money is in safe keeping.MS: So do I understand you correctly, the reason you went to the house, was to create an opportunity for your family to see you?LS: Yes.MS: And where was the money?LS: With Babalwa's maternal aunt.MS: Can we ask for a short adjournment?MS: I refer the witness to exhibit BC.MS: I see you smiling, do you recall this?LS: Yes.MS: Is it the first time you saw it yesterday?LS: Yes.MS: What do you know of the black bag with the R31 000, do you know how the police found that bag?LS: I placed the R30 000 in the bag.MS: Do you know how the police got the bag?LS: Yes.MS: Tell us.LS: The time they tortured me, they asked me whether I had money.LS: I told them I have money.LS: Then they said let us fetch it.MS: So if I understand correctly, all you said was that the phones were with your girlfriend?LS: I was not using them anymore and they were with my girlfriend.MS: Yesterday, we showed a video clip pertaining to Facebook.MS: Do you know how that video was obtained?LS: Which video?MS: Where we went into Facebook.LS: The video at KFC?MS: No the video of your conversations between Accused one and with Vumazonke.LS: I am confused. we are talking about a video?MS: Do you want to see it again?LS: Please.MS: At some stage the police obtained a further number of cellphones and sim cards that belonged to you?LS: Yes.MS: How did that come about, and when?LS: Kanna asked for then.LS: I told them my phones were not with me.LS: I told them the phones were used by my girlfriend.LS: And they went to fetch them.LS: At the same time I met with Stander, and he said he was the state prosecutor and I must not worry.LS: Then Van der Spuy came to sit where I was sitting.LS: He opened the books and told me the courts expected one thing from me, and that was to tell the truth.MS: You don't have to go into details, did you consult with him?LS: We did not talk about what happened to me. The way I saw it, even Van der Spuy was aware what had happened to me.LS: Then he said he was going to represent me. I believe that was the day I went to court.MS: We have heard evidence that at some stage you made a statement.MS: I don't want to deal with that statement now. All I want to know is that can you explain how you made a statement?LS:: Do you mean in Fort Beaufort?MS: No, through Kanna.LS: Kanna said to me that it seems that if I don't talk to them then I will talk better to the other people from before. I don't recall clearly what I said to Kanna.MS: I will return to that at a later stage.MS: And the next day?MS: The next day you went to court?LS: I spent a long time at Kabega Park and the meeting I had with Kanna.LS: I cant recall if the attorney came after I spoke to Chris or before, or if he arrived on the day I was supposed to be in court.LS: The attorney came in your company Mr Stander, I am sure you would know what day that was.MS: That is why I am taking you to the day after the meeting with Chris.MS: Can you recall?LS: I was taken to Kanna, and then Mr Van der Spuy arrived. At that stage I did not know that he was an attorney.LS: He came, he was carrying some books.LS: Kanna and others brought the lawyer to me and said he is Van der Spuy, and told me here is [my] lawyer.MS And who was in the bakkie when this meeting took place?LS: It was myself and Chris.MS: What happened to the driver?LS: He went out.MS: Why?LS: He didn't say why.MS: The meeting is now over, what happened then?LS: We went back to the cells.LS: They said to me, Chris must not see that I was assaulted.LS: So I must tell him so that he will confess.LS: Then we drove to the place, where I phoned Chris to tell him to meet at the garage.LS: We arrived at the garage and waited there.LS: Chris arrived.LS: The driver made a signal that he could see the bakkie that was parked in a particular spot.MS: And did a meeting then take place?LS: He called me to his vehicle.LS: I told him I can't go to his vehicle cause the police are looking for me, he must come to this vehicle.MS: Was this on a telephone call?TP: I don't want to go into this conversation My lord.Chetty: I don't believe we are going there.MS: No we won't go there.MS: What I want to know is was that on a telephone, and if so, whose telephone?LS: That was my phone.MS: And then that was when the meeting took place?LS: Yes.MS: How did it come that you ended up in the vehicle?LS: They told me they were going to record and I must make sure that Chris confesses.MS: Did you have a recording device?LS: No.MS: Did you know where the recording device was?LS: They said it was inside the vehicle, they didn't say where.MS: Where did you get into the vehicle?LS: At Kanna's offices.MS: And did you know the driver?LS: I don't know his name.MS: Were you searched?LS: No I wasn't searched.MS: Were you handcuffed?LS: They were removed from me when I got into the vehicle.MS: And then?LS: So after that I was told to set a time when we would be able to meet.LS I set a time for late, because it was said I must tell him that I was not in town and was still on my way to PE and to set the time for late.LS: I was then placed in a police van with a Xhosa officer.MS: Were you in PE or weren't you?LS: I was in Kanna's offices.MS: And what was the instruction, what did you have to convey to him?LS: I was told to make him confess and that he was involved in his wife's situation.MS: So you were told to lie to Accused one?LS: Yes.MS: Were you told how to convey this information to him, or did they allow you to make it up?LS: They told me what to tell Chris.MS: So let's pick it up.MS: So they wanted you to make it clear to Accused Number one, that you knew that Sizwe was involved?LS: They wanted me to make it clear that Vumazonke told me everything.MS: I want to take you back, when we started this morning, I have to ask you that question again.MS: When MS: When Vumazonke told you about his involvement, and you were sent to Accused one to collect the R80 000.MS: What did you indicate to Accused one at that stage?LS: I told him that Sizwe says he wants his money.LS: If he doesn't pay him the money, he is going to take the money out on his body.MS: Were you comfortable with the instruction from the police?LS: Which one?MS: To get Accused one to confess.LS: That is the way I understood it.LS: The way I understood it was that if I didn't get Chris to confess I would take his place.MS: I understand that, I want to know were you happy to make it?TP: He has answered the question.MS: So you made the choice to go?LS: I didn't have a choice.MS: So what happened from there?Siyoni is reminded he is under oath.MS: Perhaps now is the perfect time for an adjournment?Chetty: Court is adjourned.MS: Can I deal with one last aspect?Chetty: Yes.MS: So the police wanted you to make it clear to accused number one that Sizwe had made it clear to you that he was involved.LS: They said I must tell him and also add what they told me, so that it must be clear that I also bear knowledge of this.LS: So they wanted me to put it in such a way that it would make sense to him, that the money he gave me the police had, so that I needed money to get out of PE.LS: I said I can't go to OK.LS: I can't go to OK, because they had got information from an informer that Chris had got people to kill me.LS: They said I must meet up with him to meet at a garage.LS: So we agreed to meet at the garage.LS: Then they said to me, I must go to make him to confess that what was intimated to me, that he was aware of it and that it came from him.LS: Because what was intimated by Sizwe to me, perhaps he will also make the same intimation to me.LS: And I must make it clear that Chris sent me, I never understood how I should make that I must do that.LS: They said that I must do it in such a way that it became clear to me that Sizwe did tell me about it.LS: And that I know what Sizwe told me.LS: But even during the time I made the call, the attorney never arrived on that day.LS: They were shouting, make the call, phone Chris phone Chris.MS: Did you not want to make the call?LS: I did not want to call.LS: But because they said if I don't call Chris I will go to jail for the money that I kept from Chris.LS: I called him and told him I was in trouble and I requested to see him.LS: He said he was unable to come, as he was busy with his family.LS: I said I was pleading with him, because I am in trouble.LS: At some point he asked me as to where I was.LS: I was told to say that I was not in PE.LS: Because they needed time.LS: They are going to set up a place where they want him.LS: Then he said I must go to OK.MS: Who is the he?LS: That was Chris.LS: Given the time of the calls, I was also told to send SMSes.LS: I was told to tell him that it is me Luthando and that I need to see him.MS: Do you remember yesterday we dealt with two SMSes. Would that be the SMSes you are referring to?LS: No.MS: So that was not one of the SMSes you sent?LS: No.LS: Then I was told he did make a phone call and I must call him back.MS: Before we move off the SMS, what did it say?LS: I was told I must state in the SMS, that it was me that was phoning him.LS: I was then told to make the phone call and that my attorney was on his way.MS: I just want to know, just for a minute, from what phone did you phone accused one the first day?LS: They said I must phone him from the small phone that they found in my possession.MS: So it was your own phone?LS: Yes.MS: Were you ever told on which phone Chris returned the call, or don't you know?LS: It seems it was the small phone that I used.MS: So it seems accused one did return your call, what happened then?LS: It seems there is something I omitted.MS: So you are now taken back to Kabega Park?LS: I was fetched again.MS: By who?LS: I'm not sure.LS: I was taken back by the person who took me there the first day.LS: Then I returned to the offices.MS: The offices where Kanna was?LS: Yes.LS: Then they said Chris had returned my call.MS: Who told you?LS: Kanna and the others were sitting there, even Chris's friend.MS: Now you told us you did have information about the murder of Jayde.MS: Did you tell him that information?LS: I told him.MS: So you told him about the R80 000 and the agreement between accused number one and Sizwe?LS: Yes I told him.MS: That day were you successful in getting Chris to confess?LS: No, I didn't get hold of him.MS: you must assist me, you didn't get hold of him?MS: I thought you did get hold of him and he told you he can't speak because he was with family.LS: I did not get him to confess on that day my lord.MS: Were you assaulted that day?LS: I was threatened.MS: By who?LS: Kanna.MS: How?LS: He got up and grabbed me by the shoulder and told me I spoke better with those people.MS: Did you see that as a threat, that he was going to send you back there?LS: Yes.MS: And what happened further?LS: I was then taken back to Kabega Park police station.MS: Now I want to make sure we are on the same page.MS: Do I understand you correctly that you were compelled to make these calls?LS: Yes they forced me.MS: And why did you agree?LS: Because they told me if I can't get Chris I will be taking his place.MS: Is that the reason you called?LS: They said I could see 25 years because I took money, and because I know what I was told and did not tell the police, so they were certain I was also involved.LS: Then I must tell him that the police knew about the money given to Sizwe and that I wanted to leave so that I can get out of PE.LS: They told me to ask for R5 000.LS: I then made a call to Chris, but he said he was busy, he can't speak to me, he is still sitting with his family.LS: I made frequent calls to him, but he avoided my calls.LS: I then called again, and someone else answered the phone, it wasn't him. They said Chris was busy.LS: Then they phoned.MS: Who are they?LS: I think it was the investigating officers. I was sitting with Kanna and others, and I thought they were all investigating officers.MS: So it was someone else than Kanna?LS: It was the man who claimed to be Chris's friend.LS: Then he made the call, and spoke to Chris, and then said I must call again.LS: But he did not answer.MS: Lets deal with that first day.MS: Do you have any recollection of making a call to Chris on that day?LS: Yes I did make a call to Chris. I had a telephone placed in front of me and I was asked why am I defending Chris because this person killed his wife. I must make the call if I want to get out.LS: I was given the phone and I said I can't make a call without my lawyer.LS: They made phone calls and said my lawyer will come again.LS: I was given the phone to call Chris and told to make him confess.LS: They said they needed his fingerprints. I don't recall if it was that day, but they needed his fingerprints, his and Sizwe's.MS: So what did you do?LS: I was taken back to Kabega again.MS: Did you make any calls that day?LS: I did make a call.MS: What happened, how did this call go?LS: No I didn't make a call.MS: You didn't make a call?LS: I don't know if it was that day, I know I was supposed to make a call.LS: I again asked to speak to a lawyer.LS: They took out their phones and made as if they were phoning for a lawyer, but said they can't get hold of one.LS: They said they want Chris. They said I must cooperate or face 25 years.LS: They would make sure I am given 25 years.LS: According to my involvement and the issue of the money and Sizwe.LS: It means in that way I was also involved.MS: So what happened the first day?LS: I can't remember if it was the first thing, but the said I must make Chris confess, so that there can be something that can cause him to be arrested, because I was given the money by him.MS: So they wanted you to make accused number one confess?LS: Yes.LS: They wanted me to make the same confession that I had made to the judge.LS: When I appeared to deny it, they said it seems I would speak better when I was back with the people who assaulted me.MS: Who said that to you?LS: That was Kanna.LS: Then he said I don't have a bucket of water in front of him.LS: There were other things he said that I can't recall.MS: So you are there, and Kanna says you are speaking better than when you were at the judge????LS: He didn't say I spoke better when I was at the judge, he said I spoke better when I spoke to the guys who tortured me and he would send me back to them.LS: Kanna told me that when I gave the statement if I was aware that I spoke to a judge.LS: then I realised that Kanna knows the people who had tortured me.LS: I ended up conveying to Kanna the same version that I gave there [to the torturers].LS: They said with respect to the version I gave them, I could be sentenced to 25 years, and there was only one route for me to escape that.LS: That was if I became a Section 204, but that was mentioned to me the following day.LS: When I said I wanted an attorney, Kanna said it seems I was speaking better from where I was coming from.LS refers to judge...MS: I am completely lost now, when were you in the presence of a judge?LS: Kanna said the person I was taken to in Fort Beaufort to make the Section 204 statement was a judge.LS: He said I can't correct this statement because I was asked questions by the judge.MS: I don't want to jump forward to the 204 statement.TP: I object, the state cannot dictate what the witness can say.Chetty: Let him tell you his story.MS: So he booked you out, and then?LS: I was taken to Kanna's offices.LS: When I got there, there were four people, plus Kanna.LS: They told me to sit down.LS: After I sat down, they showed me photographs of a person lying down, covered in blood.LS: That was a female.LS: I don't recall clearly, but I remember Kanna standing up.LS: He said I must make a phonecall to Chris and I must make Chris confess.LS: I asked them if I am supposed to talk here if I don't have an attorney present.LS: They told me that they don't have time.MS: Who said that?LS: One of the men, he said he was Chris's chommie.MS: Does the name Aldre Koen mean anything to you?LS: I don't know, I just know this man was the one who was booking me out and transporting me to Kanna.MS: So he was the one who took you to see the detectives?LS: Yes.MS: And he was the one who told you he mustn't be in a hurry to get an attorney.LS: Yes.LS: I told him I wanted one yesterday.LS: He said the same thing for yesterday.MS: Is it the same detective you dealt with the day before?LS: Yes, it was the detective that I dealt with in Fort Beaufort who asked me about ace. He was the same one who returned me to PE.MS: Do you know him?LS: He never introduced himself.MS: If I give you his surname, would you know him?LS: I need to see a card, a picture of him?MS: Can you describe him?LS: He is thin, slender.MS: Slender build?LS: He is same size as you - points to Stander - maybe shorter.MS: So you saying I'm slender, I will accept that.MS: From there?LS: I was taken back to Port Elizabeth.MS: Where to?LS: To Kabega Park, and was placed in the cell.LS: In the cell I was placed, there were wet blankets.LS: If my recollection serves me, I ended up sleeping on some sponges, without a blanket.LS: I don't recall when it was that I went to Kanna and the others exactly????.LS: But I was regularly booked out.LS: The one day I was booked out by a detective that was working there.LS: I asked him to have my attorney present and asked him if I was not supposed to have an attorney present.MS: Did you have an attorney at that time?LS: I did not have the opportunity to obtain the services at the time.MS: Did you have someone in mind?LS: I did not have a contact that I knew, but I knew someone who could arrange an attorney for me.MS: And what did this detective say when you asked for an attorney?LS: He said "Don't be in a hurry, you will get an attorney". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS: So then?LS: I gave the statement. After I was done, I signed.LS: Even before I signed I asked must I not sign when my attorney is present and he said no I must just sign.MS: So help me understand. You wanted an attorney present?LS: Yes I asked for him.MS: Did you know you were entitled to an attorney out of your own accord, or how did you know you needed an attorney?LS: I just thought that myself.MS: And you were refused that option, it wasn't even a point of discussion????LS: No they didn't take heed to my request.MS: And your reply?LS: At the time I did not reply, I just looked at him.MS: Yes?MS: Why did you do that?LS: That was after I saw one of the people who tortured me arriving, So I did not feel safe anymore in the office where I was.MS: Before you saw this person arriving, did you feel safe, or not?LS: No I didn't know what I was doing there or what was happening.MS: I can understand this.MS: Before this torturer arrived, were you feeling safe or not?TP: Objection. The answer has been given.Chetty: Can you repeat what he said?Interpreter repeats.TP: And therefore he did not feel safe my lord.TP: He was still going to say it.LS: I didn't feel safe.MS: You must help me out here. What did he want?LS: The statement I gave him he said was not the statement I gave at the place where I was coming from. Then I realised this was the same thing from what happened at Uitenhage. That they don't want my statement, they want their own statement that they know of.MS: Did you then make a statement?LS: I ended up telling him what I was told at Uitenhage.LS: Then I ended up giving him the version that I gave there.MS: So the person you were talking to said it seems like you spoke better to the other people?LS: Yes.LS: He asked me "Where is the gun?" I said "Which gun?"LS: He said, "What did you say to the men who beat you when asked where is the gun?"LS: Then one of the men who tortured me arrived outside and spoke to my escort.LS: Then he said he was going to take me back to those people because I spoke better to them.LS: I ended up giving him what they wanted.MS: You were placed in a cell...LS: I was told that I was waiting for someone to arrive.LS: I was fetched the next morning.LS: We went to another office.LS: We waited outside. Afterwards I was told to come into the office and I went inside.LS: Where I was sitting there was a closed window and I sat down and a male person came in and asked me for my names.MS: Do you know who he is?LS: He introduced himself to me, but I can't recall his name.MS: Was he a policeman?LS: He was not dressed in uniform.MS: Did he tell you what he was?LS: I don't recall him telling me what he was.MS: Yes?LS: So he asked me for my names and I told him. Then as he was writing them, I asked am I not to answer questions in the presence of my attorney.LS: He told me not to tell him nonsense and not to waste his time or he will take me back.MS: At that stage did you know why you were going to Fort Beaufort?LS: No.MS: You had no idea why you were going there?LS: No.MS: And then?LS: Someone came and escorted me, it was a male person, and we went inside and I was placed in a waiting cell.MS: Was that the first time you were placed in a waiting cell?LS: Yes it was the first time.MS: At Kabega, were you not in a waiting cell?LS: No I was not.MS: So now you are in the waiting cell?LS: At Fort Beaufort, while I was in the holding cells, there were two female police officers that I heard asking the man who escorted me if I had any injuries.LS: But my injury was not just my swollen eye, because by then I was limping.MS: Why were you limping?LS: It was from the person who was jumping up and down on my back, my legs and my knees. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS: So up to the stage before you went to Fort Beaufort, was that all?MS: I just want to know what they told you to say.LS: The time when I agreed to say what they were telling me to say they stopped perpetrating the assault on me.MS: So you are now driving to Fort Beaufort.MS: You arrive there, what happens?LS: When we got to Fort Beaufort the Charge Office was closed and the lights were off.LS: They first knocked on the back and then went to the front.LS: The door was then opened.MS: Did they say anything else?LS: They said they had an informer.MS: Did they ask you to say anything else?LS: They told me what I told the court.MS: Is that all?LS: Yes.MS: I want to stop you there, cause now we already on the road to Fort Beaufort.MS: You told us yesterday the police had told you what to say.LS: Yes.MS: So before you left for Fort Beaufort, did the police already tell you what to say?LS: Yes.MS: Who told you what to say?LS: I was told when I was tortured.MS: Do you remember who?LS: All of them were saying the same thing.MS: And what did they say?LS: We know that Chris enlisted you to recruit Sizwe, why don't you say that?MS: So they wanted you to say that Chris hired you to recruit Sizwe?LS: That is how they put it.
