"We finished clearing Gogjali and took control of the Mosul television station building," Staff Lieutenant General Abdelwahab al-Saadi said. Another senior commander also confirmed in a statement that the village and the TV station had been recaptured. Iraqi forces launched a massive operation aimed at retaking Mosul from the Islamic State group more than two weeks ago, and have been advancing on the city on multiple fronts. ISIS overran Mosul along with swathes of other territory in the summer of 2014, but Iraqi forces have since regained significant ground from jihadists, and the city is now their last stronghold in the country. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
