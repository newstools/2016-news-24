That followed a catastrophic 2015 in which attacks claimed by the Islamic State group killed 59 foreign visitors and 13 Tunisians, dealing a devastating blow to the key tourism industry.Strikes and social unrest have also hit strategic sectors including phosphate mining.Around 15% of the workforce was unemployed in the spring of 2016 according to the World Bank - many of them young graduates, who have seen the hope of the Arab Spring dissipate.The government hopes the conference, attended by more than 2 000 business, finance and political leaders from 40 countries, will attract billions of dollars of much-needed investment.Officials say the conference is part of a charm offensive aimed at the private sector.It is also seeking bids on 140 ventures - from infrastructure and agricultural projects to hi-tech schemes - worth roughly $32bln.The European Union announced a doubling of its financial support in 2017 to $318m.Essebsi will head to Brussels on Wednesday and Thursday for an EU-Tunisian summit.Chahed told AFP last week that Tunisia deserved support and that the international community "should invest in Tunisian democracy".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
