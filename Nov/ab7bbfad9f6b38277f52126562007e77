"An urgent internal investigation has been launched and will run concurrently with the Saps investigation to determine the sequence of events and the roles of all parties involved," he said in a separate statement. The SANDF regretted the events and would co-operate fully with the police. Adelbert, who witnessed Friday's events said: "They refused to listen and continued offloading the furniture.&nbsp;"They then took out assault rifles in an act of intimidation. The assault rifles were armed, the clip was in, their safety was off and fingers were on the trigger. One tap of the trigger and a bullet would have come out the barrel."&nbsp;The furniture did not belong to the municipality, so there was no reason for it to be dumped there, according to Adelbert.The items dumped included cooking equipment, a couch and shelves.On Saturday he commented that the municipality had shown it would not stand for for any contravention of the law, or any undemocratic activities.It was not immediately clear whether anybody had been arrested in connection with the incident, or whether there had been a court order to enforce the evictions from the military base. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
