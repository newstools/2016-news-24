The family has denied the allegations.Madonsela was due to release the report on October 14, the last day of her seven-year term.However, Zuma and Co-operative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen went to the High Court to ask for an interdict to stop her from doing so.WATCH the video:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
