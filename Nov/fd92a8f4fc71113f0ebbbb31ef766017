Sabelo was speaking at the Youth League's eThekwini regional conference in Durban.&nbsp; He said it was "high time the ANC unites"."Maybe if they want, they might require advice from the youth league on how to run the movement."Sabelo said that the election of leadership within the party would define the ANC's future."I think the next elective conference we are going to have must be different from the rest. We must be together in our choices. In the last two conferences we saw a lot of splinter groups."Sabelo also made an open call for Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to be elected the next president of the country. "In KZN we have a lot of confidence that President Jacob Zuma will help ensure a female president is elected for office. We want Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma."He added that the ANC leadership had committed to working with the youth league and asked for those promises to be kept. "There are many promises made in terms of youth development and we must ensure all are achieved so young people are developed."He said the ANC should divert its attention to young people "who are the most vulnerable in society". "There must be a priority on youth development and unemployment. The ANC must ensure they are eradicated in the province and country."&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
