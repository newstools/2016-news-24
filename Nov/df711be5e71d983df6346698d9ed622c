The court heard he suffered multi-organ dysfunction, was on a ventilator and underwent dialysis.Attempts by his lawyer to have a conversation with him were all but impossible as he apparently struggled to keep his eyes open for more than a few minutes.Raves was expected to remain in hospital until the end of next month and would only be fit to resume daily activities on January 15.Warrant of arrest held overProsecutor Shireen Riley asked that the case be postponed until next year for another pre-trial hearing.She said they were waiting for the National Director of Public Prosecutions to authorise a racketeering charge against Laher who is out on R100 000 bail.They needed a centralisation certificate as Raves was in Gauteng. A transcription of telephone monitoring was also being urgently typed up.Judge Nape Dolamo granted a postponement until February 10. He held over a warrant of arrest for Raves until that date.Laher is accused of buying guns from ex-police officer Chris Prinsloo of Vereeniging, who was recently sentenced to 18 years behind bars after entering a plea and sentence agreement with the State.He pleaded guilty to 11 charges including theft, racketeering and money laundering.Guns sold to gangsPrinsloo, a former police colonel, was in charge of the police armoury and stole 2 400 guns over almost a decade.In his plea agreement Prinsloo said he provided guns to a man in Cape Town.Prinsloo apparently met Laher in Gauteng when he was a police officer and Laher a reservist.After his arrest he told police that he sold about 2 000 guns to Laher, the State alleges.Raves was arrested in August 2015 after several guns ranging from assault rifles to smaller calibre arms were seized.Prinsloo pleaded guilty to stealing guns and ammunition destined for destruction and reselling them, primarily to gangs on the Cape Flats. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
