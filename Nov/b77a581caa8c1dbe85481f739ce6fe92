Tlouamma asked.Ramaphosa did not entertain the question."Madam Speaker, I don't think that deserves an answer from me," he said."The honourable member knows what the processes are. He is not a member of the African National Congress, and I think that is his problem. If he was a member of the ANC, he will know how things get done."DOWNLOAD the full State Capture report hereRamaphosa fielded questions from Democratic Alliance MPs on government's so-called war with itself, and what steps were being taken to ensure stability in the state.DA Chief Whip John Steenhuisen asked Ramaphosa if Zuma's &ldquo;frivolous&rdquo; interdict against former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's state capture report undermined her office, and if Zuma should pick up the bill for the litigation."The issue of our state institutions, particularly Chapter Nine institutions, are regulated by our Constitution," he answered."The various rights that citizens have are also regulated. So individuals, be they officials, politicians or ordinary citizens, all have rights that they exercise, all in terms of our Constitution."It gives them the right to go to any court to get justice, to get their rights redefined and clarified, and that right must be available even to a president of a country."The courts should make the judgment over who should pay the costs of the state capture interdict applications, and Zuma would abide by their ruling, he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
