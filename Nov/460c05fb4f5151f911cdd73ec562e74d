But this week, its mobile operations made a profit for the first time in more than half a decade. The man credited for this turnaround is CEO Sipho Maseko.&nbsp; The telecommunications company has been shedding jobs due to poor decisions, consistent declines in its fixed-line business, slow responses to rapid changes in the communications sector and a late entry into the mobile space.&nbsp; However, this week Maseko announced the positive news, saying Telkom&rsquo;s mobile division had turned an operating profit. Also, it had made a significant profit at its overall business.&nbsp; Maseko, a lawyer by training, joined Telkom as its boss in April 2013, bringing his experience from Vodacom, where he was CEO and managing director. When he arrived at Telkom, the company&rsquo;s mobile division had just sustained an operating loss of R2.2&thinsp;billion in the year ended September 2012. This week, that unit delivered an operating profit of R214&thinsp;million.&nbsp; In an interview with City Press on Friday, Maseko attributed the profitability of the division to the &ldquo;heroic efforts&rdquo; of the leadership and the hundreds of people who work for Telkom Mobile.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have opened new channels, launched new products and we are leveraging data,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Telkom had not only been a price leader in the telecommunications space, but it &ldquo;offered a lot more value&rdquo; when it came to the design of its packages, he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;[The demand growth for voice phone calls] is near the end of its lifespan and we have responded to increasing customer needs for data in our product design. We have aligned our products to growing customer requirements,&rdquo; Maseko said.&nbsp; The world of telecommunications is changing, Maseko explained, and this change was bigger than Telkom&rsquo;s mobile unit. There was increasing spend on broadband and fibre products, and customers weren&rsquo;t bothered about whether broadband was delivered via mobile or fibre.&nbsp; As a result, Maseko and his team reckoned they should drive the convergence of services in an integrated bundle. This is part of the reason for the R2.6&thinsp;billion acquisition of IT company Business Connexion Group in August last year and it will assist Telkom to be more competitive and open up new opportunities in the business space.&nbsp; On whether his time at Telkom has been stressful, Maseko said it had presented him with some of the &ldquo;most fascinating&rdquo; moments of his career.&nbsp; &ldquo;No two days are the same,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Telkom&rsquo;s shareholders &ndash; including government with a 39% stake &ndash; have benefited from Maseko&rsquo;s moves to turn the company around. When Maseko joined the company, Telkom&rsquo;s share price was languishing at about R15 a share. This week, it was quoted at R66.40 &ndash; a massive 343% improvement, which values the company at R35&thinsp;billion.&nbsp; But Maseko&rsquo;s turnaround plan to reduce costs at the company came at a price. Almost 7&thinsp;500 people lost their jobs when the company instituted retrenchments. Maseko said he was &ldquo;eternally grateful&rdquo; to the people who had taken voluntary packages. The job cuts had not been the only means that he used to reduce costs &ndash; other savings came from procurement savings and renegotiating contracts, he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;We did lose many people, but it is a fact of life that technology is changing,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; He added that, in the process, Telkom enabled many of those who took packages to start businesses that the company had utilised. In some instances, Telkom provided them with capital support.&nbsp; Maseko said that, at the end of September, Telkom had 3.2&thinsp;million customers, which included corporations that signed up for the company&rsquo;s products because they &ldquo;like the pricing and product design&rdquo;. It also attracted customers who favoured &ldquo;postpaid and prepaid packages&rdquo;, as well as clients who used a large amount of data for social-media platforms and video viewing.&nbsp; Maseko said the company would continue to play &ldquo;an insurgency role in the market&rdquo;, even though it was not one of the dominant players in the mobile market.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t box pound for pound against a guy who is bigger than you. You&rsquo;ve got to box, weave and retreat &ndash; that&rsquo;s insurgency,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; To boost Telkom&rsquo;s market share, Maseko has been leading the price war in the local mobile sector together with Cell C. Consumers should thank Maseko and Cell C for much more competitively priced telecommunications offerings and packages, and for helping to break the Vodacom and MTN oligopoly.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
