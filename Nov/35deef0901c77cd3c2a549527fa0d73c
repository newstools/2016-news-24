Those who were implicated would be notified and would have to rewrite the mathematics paper 2 examination, he said.However, this should not cause panic among matric pupils as the paper had only been exposed to a small group."It must be made clear that there is no need for learners to panic as it is only those who have been found with access to the paper that will have to rewrite, as the initial investigation indicates that the leak was contained among a small group of learners," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
