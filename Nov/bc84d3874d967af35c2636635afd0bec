It&rsquo;s like with Polokwane in South Africa, choosing between [Jacob] Zuma and [Thabo] Mbeki. Both bad options,&rdquo; he said.The EFF believed Trump would enter into a phase of aggressive negotiations as he tried to return the US to its status of the only superpower on the globe.COLUMN: 10 reflections on Trump's stunning victory"The world order he thinks of is encapsulated in the notion of America first. America must be the most powerful in terms of the economy, nuclear development, and military strength."Trump was a political undergraduate student who lacked an understanding of global politics. He was anti-black and a misogynist, Ndlozi said.ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said the party welcomed Trump's win, but expressed some caution.&lsquo;Strange views&rsquo;He said Trump had expressed some &ldquo;strange views&rdquo; about relations with other nations as well as his views on other religions.The party was concerned this might lead to other problems in the world. He hoped Trump made the remarks in the context of campaigning and that his win would not necessarily mean a change in US relations with the rest of the world.The DA said Trump&rsquo;s win was an illustration of what happened when a large portion of the population felt excluded from the economy and its political institutions."Without a growing and inclusive economy, and without independent political institutions which work, radical and regressive political bodies are fuelled by the frustration and discontentment of citizens," the party said in a statement.WATCH: America won't collapse under Trump, says former diplomatDivisive nationalism had re-emerged globally over the last few years and was a threat to the hard-won progress the world had made over the last 50 years."We cannot allow the politics of 'us' and 'them' to divide us further along the lines of race, ethnicity, nationality, sex and gender." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
