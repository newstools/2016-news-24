It is totally unacceptable," he said.Lehohla blamed a high dropout rate among black students for the statistics."There are several reasons, but you find that their stories are the same. When a 17-year-old with no money is admitted at university and funded for education, but does not have money for food, or accommodation or some other essential, they drop out. Where else can they get money to sustain themselves?" he said to the committee.There were instances where students failed because of partying, drugs and alcohol, he said."We all did that at university. But this rate of failure is not because all of them do drugs and drink. It can't be, there has to be a different explanation," he said.Education was only number 18 on the list of priorities for politicians and it would continue to be a problem until it was prioritised, he said referring to the results of a survey conducted by his office.WATCH this video:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
