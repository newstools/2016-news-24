Their acts of direct war and sponsored militias are a widely-known blemish on the global human rights agenda.&rdquo;The withdrawal would help the continent establish pan-African institutions that would guarantee and enforce justice on human rights matters.&ldquo;The ANC will lead the charge to have leaders of African institutions and African countries redouble efforts to strengthen existing continental structures that protect and promote human rights.&rdquo;On October 21, Justice Minister Michael Masutha told reporters that South Africa had initiated the process of withdrawing from the ICC by notifying the United Nations of its intention to revoke its ratification of the Rome Statute, which established the ICC. The decision followed several court judgments that the government violated the law by not arresting ICC-indicted Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir during his visit to South Africa in June last year.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
