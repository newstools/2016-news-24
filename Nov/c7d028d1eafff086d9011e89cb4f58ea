"I say to Saudis... reform your school because terrorism has historically come from it. I say this to you with love and modesty," the minister said, according to the private Mosaique FM radio station. Wahhabism, the fundamentalist school of Islam practised in Saudi Arabia, has been accused of inspiring extremist ideologies in the region.Ben Salem tried to row back from his comments, issuing a statement saying that Tunisia's relations with the kingdom were "completely harmonious".Tunisia has witnessed a series of extremist attacks since the popular uprising of 2011, including deadly attacks on foreign tourists in 2015. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
