The 83-year-old Goldberg said his peers should only meet with the current ANC leadership to deliver a message to both the president and his top six. "We must not be dragged into a drawn-out discussion and side-tracked by appeals to unity with a bunch of people who have no understanding of the meaning of unity."Not worth being called comradesThe stalwart said he had reached a point where he could no longer call some in the ANC his comrades, accusing them of uncomradely behaviour."They are just 'Mr' or 'Ms' or just plain 'you'," wrote Goldberg.Goldberg, who was once on the ANC's integrity committee, accused Mantashe of passing the buck when it came to whether or not the elders should have investigated President Jacob Zuma. He claims comments made by the secretary general of the ANC against the integrity committee over the matter were disingenuous as Mantashe's role is to refer matters and approve investigations undertaken by the committee."You have failed to stop the rot. You should go," is what he said should be communicated to both Zuma and Mantashe.Goldberg was one of the few who had been hoping that ANC members of Parliament would vote with their consciences as opposed to towing the party line on a vote of no confidence against Zuma on Thursday, but the party used its majority to shut down the motion.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
