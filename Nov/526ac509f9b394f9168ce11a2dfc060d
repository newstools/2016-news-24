Christopher Panayiotou will spend his 30th birthday at the Eastern Cape High Court as day 16 of the Panayiotou trial gets underway. Jump to bottom PB: The report itself was in excel and the brand logo, company letterhead was also on the document. I then looked at the data I was going to be using, dates times, latitude and longitude and checked that it was in the right format.I then checked if there was any absent data, where data should have been recorded. MS: I want to know - a lot of your evidence yesterday and this morning relates to waypoints.Are there methods, checks and balances that you use to ensure accuracy?PB: Yes. Data that is received from upload source, is always dealt with with a bit of caution.&nbsp;The first is to determine the source.&nbsp;I received this data from an email from the company, CarTrack.PB: On photo album A1, slide 8, the track runs from A1 to A2.In order to compare tyre track to tyre you need unique characteristics to the tyre. As is visible here, it veered off stones into soft sand.Nowhere was there enough unique characteristics to make the comparison.PB: One aspect, while we are here, that I did not cover sufficiently during the crime scene itself.MS: You said there was 16m of tyre track at the crime scene.MS: What was it that made it that the tyre track could not be recovered to be compared with, for example, the ridge track of the tyres on the vehicle recovered?MS: Are you saying the GPS reading of that waypoint, correlates with the reading you took at the crime scene?PB: It corresponds as far as it is in the same location, there are small decimal points that it differs but it is the same location.PB: At 07:11.04, waypoint logged at entrace to dirt road at cattle grid.&nbsp;Arrow turns up dirt road.PB: Journey ended at 07:13:10 with an ignition off. A waypoint was recorded at 07:12:32, at one of the fixed points that I recorded.&nbsp;At this stage this was just before the ignition was turned off.&nbsp;This correlates with point A2 on the crime scene photo, which is the end of the vehicle tyre track found at the crime scene.MS: At the crime scene itself, were you able to do the same exercise?PB calls up new map, shows bush area near Kwanobuhle.PB: The journey is marked out in blue, is still part of one continuous journey that started in Kwanobuhle without any ignition off. This journey starts at 07:10:40.Animation shows arrow moving slowly along the screen.PB: It is going to take slightly longer, but I don't want to change the speed in correlation to the previous slides.Arrow now halfway across screen.PB: I must qualify, the points plotted as the data was received is definitely off the road, but the data is only as accurate as the device itself.&nbsp;MS: Would I be correct, the one point is 6.28.58 - the first point that is off the road?PB: YesMS: And the next is 6.29.19?PB: YesMS: And after that the vehicle returns to the road?PB: YesMS: So the vehicle veered off the road?PB: YesMS: Before returning to the main road?PB: YesMS: Can you explain the diversion?PB: This is situated at point C, where the gate is.The distance indicates the vehicle was possibly off the tar road itself... if we look at the driveway in front of the gate.PB calls up new map. This short section deals with from 6.28 to 6.29.Animation shows vehicle diverting off the main road.PB: This whole journey was from 06:04.33 am on the 21st of April, until 6:28.36 am.This was not ignition on, ignition off, this is was a full trip which started from Kwanobuhle earlier in the morning,PB: The approximate speed at which the arrow travels is also the approximate speed at which the vehicle would have travelled.All eyes are on the screen.&nbsp;Court is silentPB: As you can see the arrow speeds up when in Deacon road.The arrow shows the vehicle doing multiple loops around the townhouse complex.PB: The difference between what is on the screen and what was handed in yesterday is that yesterday's were fixed points.Today I am going to use software to do a live animation of the route in the time frame that has been requested from me.MS: Ok, I want to go back to the trip maps and take you back to the 21st of April, the early hours of the morning.That specific visit in the Deacon Road area (Deacon road is the street that the Stellen Gen townhouse is based.)What we have done is that we have all these points marked out on the screen, is it possible to show how the vehicle moved that morning.I am only interested in how the vehicle moved in deacon road.MS: I would like to thank the court for its patience.I wish to place it on record that between myself and the defence council we have sorted out a number of logistical issues relating to the case going forward.Christopher Panayiotou's family have brought a cake to court.
