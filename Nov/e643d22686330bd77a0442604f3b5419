Many migrants get stuck in the unstable north African nation, working to pay off debts before finally setting sail."His plan was to cross to Italy by boat," Nying said."One of the survivors called his brother and informed him about the incident. The caller told the brother that only 10 people survived when the boat capsized on the high seas."Mille Franc is said to have made his debut in early 2012, working under Coach Nying of Club Serrekunda Gome Saboppa, in the outskirts of the Gambia's capital, Banjul.Incredibly dangerous&nbsp;A spokesperson for the Gambia Wrestling Federation, Matarr Saine, spoke of the grief of the whole wrestling community."He was one of the most disciplined wrestlers in the country and he was really committed to the sport," Saine told AFP on Wednesday night.Some of the country's finest wrestlers have resettled in Europe after boarding makeshift boats from Libya to Italy.But Saine said not only was the journey by boat incredibly dangerous, but the Gambia needed its best and brightest to stay."We are discouraging young people, especially wrestlers, from embarking on this risky journey.It is claiming the lives of our sportsmen and women who can contribute positively to national development," he said.The news of Mille Franc's death came less than a week after the announcement that the goalkeeper of the Gambia's national women's football team had also died crossing the Mediterranean.Fatim Jawara, is believed to have been just 19.Gambian President Yahya Jammeh said in a televised address last year that "true Muslims" would encourage their sons and daughters to take up job opportunities which are available at home.In reality 60 percent of the population live in poverty, and a third survive on $1.25 or less a day, according to the UN.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
