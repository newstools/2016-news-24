They seek to undermine the rule of law. They prosecute and persecute their political opponents, including members of their own party."And when everything else has failed, they kill. They assassinate their opponents."He said the EFF was standing against Zuma, but said the motion brought by Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane contained a "technical blunder"."We believe that the liberation movement itself [the ANC] should have found it in its own conscience to act against Jacob Zuma."'Nothing to lose'LIVE: #NoConfidence debate: Zuma should be a worried man - AICHe said some of the ministers seated in the House were appointed on the instruction of the Guptas, including Minerals Resources Minister Mosabenzi Zwane and Cogta Minister David van Rooyen."Before you know it, he would have captured everything. After he has dealt with everyone else, he is going to arrest you," he told ANC MPs."He is going to arrest all of you, he is going to lock you up, he is going to kill you. He has nothing to lose now."ANC MPs objected to Shivambu's comments that Zuma was going to "kill his opponents". They said it was unparliamentary.House chairperson Lechesa Tsenoli said that in the parliamentary rules, if a member brought any charge of unethical conduct against another member, he had to do so in a separate motion.Tsenoli said Shivambu should withdraw his comments on Zwane, Van Rooyen and the president.Shivambu objected from his seat and said he would "never withdraw".The United Democratic Movement's Mcedisi Filtane came to Shivambu's defence and suggested that he was perhaps speaking figuratively.Tsenoli said the violation was serious and he would be referring it to the ethics committee.The debate continued on Thursday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
