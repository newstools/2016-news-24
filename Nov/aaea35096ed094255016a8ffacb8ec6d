Kabila will address the situation on Tuesday when he speaks to parliament to discuss "the state of the nation", according to a statement read on state media.Vital Kamerhe, who led the fringe opposition bloc that participated in the national dialogue, is the favourite to succeed Matata as prime minister.Following a meeting with Kabila, Kamerhe said that the nomination of a new premier was "imminent" and the formation of a new opposition-led government would be complete within a week.'Get on board'He added that the opposition groups which boycotted the "national dialogue" could still "get on board at any moment. We are still open".The main dissident coalition Rassemblement (Gathering) - which has rallied around veteran opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi - has rejected the deal that followed the "national dialogue" and stepped up its calls for Kabila to leave office by December 19 when his term ends.Tshisekedi's UPDS party said the resignation was meaningless."The UDPS notes the resignation of Mr Matata," said spokesperson Augustin Kabuya, adding that it "will however not resolve the crisis."The Congolese people don't want a new prime minister to be named but that Mr Kabila quits power" next month, he said.
