Defence counsel along with the State have been spotted going into the judge's chambers.&nbsp;MS: Was an account opened?&nbsp;CG: Yes, it is a requirement that with all our loans, a savings account must be opened&nbsp;MS: The loan that she qualified for, how soon would that have become available? Would it have been available on the 18th?&nbsp;CG: This also included a settlement of a Nedbank loan, but after the settlement the funds would have been available&nbsp;MS: So Mrs Panayiotou was required to settle an outstanding loan with Nedbank, and then the funds would be available?&nbsp;CG: That is correct&nbsp;MS: And after the funds became available?&nbsp;CG: She transferred the money into her husband's FNB account&nbsp;TP: I am really trying to find [out what] the relevance of this evidence is, may I suggest we take the 11am adjournment?&nbsp;[court is adjourned]&nbsp;MS: If we move to the third page of this document, the savings account agreement&nbsp;CG: That is just a standard document to say the client agrees to the terms and agreements related to the savings account&nbsp;MS: And all of this took place on the 13th of March 2015?&nbsp;CG: That is correct&nbsp;MS: I take you to another document, that pertains to a Jayde Lynn Panayiotou&nbsp;MS: This was also completed by yourself. If I look at this documentation, it was completed on the 18th of March?&nbsp;CG: That is correct&nbsp;MS: And the information on here, would that be obtained from her?&nbsp;CG: That is correct&nbsp;MS: And what was her reason for being at the bank?&nbsp;CG: She was also there to apply for a loan of R80 000 to R100 000, as her husband did not qualify&nbsp;MS: And did she qualify?&nbsp;CG: Yes, she did&nbsp;MS: And she was granted a loan of R150 000, is that correct?&nbsp;CG: Yes, that is correct&nbsp;MS: Ms Goosen, can you confirm you work for Capitec Bank?&nbsp;[MS calls up document on the screen...] MS: What is this document?&nbsp;CG: Mr Panayiotou was applying for a personal loan, he was looking to purchase a house&nbsp;MS: Can you remember the amount?&nbsp;CG: About R80 000 to R100 000&nbsp;MS: And can you remember if he secured the amount?&nbsp;CG: No, he did not qualify, but we did open an account for him&nbsp;MS: Can you say why he was declined?&nbsp;CG: In this case, it was a matter that our system said he did not meet the minimum requirements, it could have been due to the affordability calculation, or due to credit record. I did not contact the head office to determine the exact reasons.&nbsp;MS: But you informed him that he did not qualify?&nbsp;CG: That is correct&nbsp;(Derrick Spies/News24)&nbsp;MS: We call [State witness] 46, Claudia Goosen (CG)&nbsp;MS: A witness, Kevin McLoughlin, testified relating to a business venture and your involvement therein. Do you know him?&nbsp;SJ: Yes I do, I introduced Christopher to him&nbsp;MS: What was your involvement in this business venture, where did you fit in? My understanding was this was five gambling licences over five sites in the Eastern Cape.&nbsp;SJ: I facilitated the deal. My role was to secure the investors, Chris was to secure the gambling licences and I would have managed the operations.&nbsp;MS: Upon a perusal of the bank statements of Infinity, there were six payments of approximately R31 000 a month made to one, Steve Jefferson, would that be you?&nbsp;SJ: That is correct&nbsp;MS: And what were these payments for? Amounts to around R187 000?&nbsp;SJ: It was the agreement CP and I had&nbsp;MS: And what did you do, or [what] were you supposed to do for this payment?&nbsp;SJ: I was to secure investors. Part of it was to get McLoughlin on board. I had three other investors, and then everything fell to pieces after his arrest.&nbsp;MS: So I accept that the R30 000 a month was essentially a salary&nbsp;SJ: It was a consultation fee&nbsp;MS: No further questions&nbsp;TP: I will argue relevance at a later stage, my lord. No questions&nbsp;PD: No questions&nbsp;MS: No further questions&nbsp;Chetty: You are excused &nbsp;MS: Can we accept you know Accused Number 1 (Christopher Panayiotou) relatively well?&nbsp;SJ: That is correct&nbsp;MS: And your cellphone number is xxx xxx xxxx?&nbsp;SJ: That is correct&nbsp;MS: I want to show you a document that shows the calls between yourself and Christopher Panayiotou (CP)&nbsp;MS: I must apologise, the reference 'Big Steve' is the way your contact was saved&nbsp;MS: We see there are 168 calls between yourself and Accused Number 1&nbsp;MS: What was the relationship between yourself and CP?&nbsp;SJ: We were friends first and foremost, and business partners&nbsp;(Derrick Spies/News24)&nbsp;MS: We call Steven Ross Jefferson (SJ)&nbsp;PD: Captain, if I understand you correctly&nbsp;PD: You are saying that on the 29th of August 2015, you obtained information that those two numbers you submitted belong to Accused Number 3?&nbsp;SdB: That is correct&nbsp;PD: You yourself have no personal knowledge of his cellphone numbers?&nbsp;SdB: The number was given to me by Nenembe's father&nbsp;PD: Apart from what was given, you have no knowledge?&nbsp;SdB: That is correct&nbsp;PD: So if Accused Number 3 were to deny that those two numbers belong to him, you would not be in a position to dispute it?&nbsp;SdB: That is correct&nbsp;PD: In other words, you can't say for a fact that those numbers belonged to Accused Number 3?&nbsp;SdB: That is correct&nbsp;PD: No further questions&nbsp;Adv Daubermann has a brief conversation with Sinethemba Nenembe #PanayiotouTrial pic.twitter.com/RONAbxiIwmChetty: The application by Mr Stander is allowed as I believe it is in the interests of justice. The full reasons will be included in my final judgment.&nbsp;MS: Thank you my lord... The State calls Stephanus de Bruin (SdB).&nbsp;MS: I take you back to your testimony yesterday, you were saying the father gave you two numbers for Accused Number 3 (Nenembe)&nbsp;[SdB reads the numbers onto the record]&nbsp;MS: Do you know the case number for the case that you were busy with?&nbsp;SdB: Yes, I know it off by heart [he recites the number]&nbsp;MS: And you were not directly involved in that case?&nbsp;SdB: No, I just assisted&nbsp;MS: And did you make a statement in relation to this case?&nbsp;SdB: I did&nbsp;MS: No further questions&nbsp;TP: No questions&nbsp;PD: May I request a short adjournment, my lord, to consult?&nbsp;Chetty: Court is adjourned&nbsp;PD: Why should they cross-examine this witness, will they have to call the father to counter this evidence? PD: On this basis my lord, I hold that you should not allow this evidence to be admissible, especially since the witness is available&nbsp;Chetty: Mr Stander&nbsp;MS: It is quite an interesting matter. I agree with everything that my learned friend has placed before the court, and with all the case law that has been put before this court&nbsp;MS: It is important to look at those cases, and in each of those cases the hearsay evidence was part of the process to secure a conviction&nbsp;MS: In all the case law before your lordship, the argument was [to] exclude the hearsay as that is the cornerstone of the conviction, or the case against the witness&nbsp;MS: I have been quite clear; I am not asking that the court makes a ruling on the information, whether the information is correct&nbsp;MS: We have to look at the purpose, and probative value&nbsp;MS: The purpose and probative value is not in any way the same as the case law before you&nbsp;MS: I am going to ask that this hearsay application be allowed&nbsp;PD: In this case, my learned friend will confirm that his entire case is based on a cellphone number that is linked to Accused Number 3&nbsp;PD: There is no other evidence that links my client to this case. There are no witnesses.&nbsp;PD: This evidence is going to play a decisive and significant role in the possible conviction&nbsp;[PD refers to more case law in front of the Supreme Court of Appeal...] PD: A judge should hesitate long and hard&nbsp;PD: What are the compelling aspects in this case, the witness is available&nbsp;PD: I also deal with the issue of admitting hearsay evidence provisionally, and there is case law that suggests this practice should be stopped&nbsp;[PD goes through more case law]&nbsp;PD: My learned friend hasn't even said why he doesn't intend to call the father&nbsp;PD: Before I go through the facts, this is not a question of discretion. The authorities are clear.&nbsp;[PD goes to the act]&nbsp;PD: My lordship is dealing with a criminal matter&nbsp;PD: Is going through the process of determining the admissibility of hearsay&nbsp;PD: Procedural prejudice: Accused Number 3 will be prejudiced. Accused Number 3 and Accused Number 4 will be severely hampered during cross-examination&nbsp;PD: Touchstone, is the submission in the interests of justice.&nbsp;[PD calls up case law]&nbsp;PD: He wants to say that this was given and led to something else, which indirectly means he relies on the evidence being true&nbsp;PD: He has conceded that it is hearsay, so the admission is governed by the amendment act, so there is a whole list of criteria&nbsp;PD: If I take you to the definition: 'hearsay evidence' means evidence, whether oral&nbsp;or in writing, the probative&nbsp;value of which depends upon the credibility of any person other than the person giving such evidence&nbsp;PD: This may be double hearsay evidence. The father may have been given the number by someone else&nbsp;PD: He can't suggest otherwise; he will have to concede this&nbsp;PD: Further, my learned friend has said he can't say if he were to call the witness&nbsp;PD: In this case, the witness is in fact available to testify, he is alive and kicking&nbsp;TP: I want to hand in Mr Inggs' statement, I would like to just hand it in before we get underway&nbsp;Chetty: That is correct&nbsp;Chetty: Can we ask for clarity? Chetty: Yesterday you said you wanted to submit the word provisionally yesterday, are you going to be calling the witness?&nbsp;MS: Perhaps I used the word provisionally incorrectly, what I am asking [is] that we accept the information&nbsp;Chetty: In terms of Section 3.1 C&nbsp;MS: I am asking the court to consider this as it shows that on this date, on the 29th of August, that this number became available to the SAPS.&nbsp;MS: I am not asking the court to attach any correctness to this particular hearsay evidence, but it is important in the sequence of events in order to show how that number was linked to Accused Number 3.&nbsp;MS: It is my submission there can be no prejudice to Accused Number 3 if I have no intention of relying on the correctness.&nbsp;Chetty: Mr Daubermann&nbsp;PD: My lord, I intend to refer you to the act and the authorities&nbsp;PD: My learned friend's application is [new], as I understand it. He concedes that the evidence being led is in fact, hearsay.&nbsp;PD: He says he wants to deduce evidence that allegedly belonged to Accused Number 3 (Nenembe)&nbsp;PD: The evidence he wants to lead is that Accused Number 3's father gave two telephone numbers that belonged to Accused Number 3. &nbsp;Christopher Panayiotou did not look upset - witness&nbsp;Jayde Panayiotou's husband Christopher showed no emotion the day her body was found, a family friend told the High Court in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday. Pieter Bekker, who had been married into the Panayiotou family but then divorced, explained that when he heard Jayde went missing on 21 April 2015, he joined the search for her. She was a teacher at&nbsp;Riebeek College Girls'&nbsp;High School in Uitenhage.&nbsp;He told the court he first he checked with Christopher whether he and Jayde had&nbsp;argued and she had gone for a walk.&nbsp;ICYMI:&nbsp;Panayiotou Internet lounge registered in employee's name&nbsp;Jayde Panayiotou's husband Christopher also owned an Internet lounge with gambling on the side in Port Elizabeth, but it was registered in an employee's name, the High Court heard on Thursday. Laurika Booi, who works at the Infinity nightclub&nbsp;co-owned by&nbsp;Christopher Panayiotou,&nbsp;told the court the I Net Lounge in Cotswold shopping centre, owned by him,&nbsp;was registered in her name. She earned a salary for working there. When asked by Panayiotou's advocate Terry Price SC why it was necessary to bring this matter up, prosecutor Marius Stander explained that it was to show that Panayiotou may have had another income stream to get the R80 000 he allegedly paid to have his wife killed.&nbsp;ICYMI:&nbsp;Jayde's parents helped her and Christopher with money&nbsp;Jayde Panayiotou's parents gave her R240 000 toward paying off her car and helping toward the purchase of a new house that her businessman husband Christopher was buying for them, the High Court in Port Elizabeth heard on Thursday. Prosecutor Marius Stander produced bank statements to assist with his questioning of her father Derrick Inggs over the flow of money between them and Jayde. The first was a withdrawal of R40 000 which Inggs said had been to assist his daughter to pay off an account for her car. The second was a payment of R100 000 from her mother Michelle and the third was another R100 000 that Derrick had given her, which he had accessed from a bond account.&nbsp;ICYMI:&nbsp;Christopher Panayiotou like a son, says Jayde's dad&nbsp;Jayde Panayiotou's father considered her husband Christopher a good friend and a good man, he told the High Court in Port Elizabeth during his son-in-law's murder trial on Thursday. Derrick Inggs choked up when Prosecutor Marius Stander opened questioning gently, asking Inggs if he knew Christopher Panayiotou. "Yes, he was a friend," said Inggs, who has had to endure gruelling testimony of his daughter's final moments, crouching in a veld, before being shot twice in the back and once in the head.&nbsp; Jump to top
