To defend himself he immediately shoved his baby's carry cot against the robber and screamed as loudly as he could, hoping his neighbour would hear him. Fortunately the baby was asleep in the bedroom with his mother. "He owns a security company," Magnus said of his neighbour. "I knew he would be able to help because he had a gun."While Magnus struggled with the robber he saw another man come into the townhouse.The noise woke his 24-year-old girlfriend who came to see what was going on."At that point, I realised my family was my priority. When the suspect tried to stab me with a knife, I ducked and fell over a chair. I crawled to my room and locked the door."Through the window the couple saw the men use one of their garden chairs to climb over the wall. One of them had Magnus' laptop. Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg, a police spokesperson, confirmed that they were investigating a case of house robbery.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
