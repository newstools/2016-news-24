Mpho Raborife, News24DA leader Mmusi Maimane arrives at the Rosebank Police Station to file a corruption case against President Jacob Zuma (Mpho Raborife, News24) Multimedia &nbsp; &nbsp; User Galleries &nbsp; &nbsp; News in Pictures Send us your pictures &nbsp; &nbsp; Send us your stories Johannesburg &ndash; Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane wants President Jacob Zuma to be criminally investigated for allegedly being implicated in dodgy Gupta-linked dealings."If you knowingly understand something to be criminal and you do nothing about it, and you yourself direct criminal activity, that is a clear case of corruption," Maimane told reporters outside Rosebank police station on Tuesday."So we are laying cases of corruption against Jacob Zuma."Maimane said the contents of the Public Protector's report, "State of Capture", had shown that Zuma had directly instructed Themba Maseko, the head of Government Communication and Information System at the time, to direct government's advertising funds to the Gupta-owned publication The New Age."That in our view is a case of inducement."Maimane said he would make sure that this matter was followed through.Wheels of justiceREAD: Zuma sidesteps 'state capture' questions from MPs"We will not rest, I will take the matter further on in Parliament and I want to make sure that the criminal elements will ensure that Jacob Zuma is prosecuted."The wheels of justice might be slow, but they do turn."I'm not expecting that this case be resolved next week, but I will spend time to make sure any crime that takes place in South Africa is accounted for."We will not rest until Jacob Zuma accounts for what we believe are very strong criminal acts. These are acts of corruption which steal away the livelihood from the people of our country and ultimately we believe action must be taken," Maimane said.In March Maseko told Sunday Times that a member of the Gupta family had tried to get him to help with a government contract involving their newspaper, The New Age.He also subsequently tweeted: "If all who have been summoned to Saxonwold [where the Guptas live] were to meet, FNB stadium won't be big enough".Maseko's comments at the time followed revelations by Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas that the Guptas approached him in 2015 to offer him former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene's job before Nene was sacked.Scene of the crimeREAD: DA 'will unravel Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s criminal network' Former MP Vytjie Mentor had made claims that she, too, was approached by the Gupta family for a ministerial position while Zuma was in the same house.Maimane said what the report had exposed was that Zuma was not the only person in the "project"."It was a project of corruption and racketeering at the highest level... If any citizen, any individual was acting in a manner that is criminal, surely there must be criminal prosecution against them and my worry in South Africa is that Jacob Zuma is being treated with kitted gloves and protected by the very institutions that must protect us as the people of this country," he said.Maimane said the party had chosen to file the case in Rosebank because of its geographical proximity to Saxonwold."We made sure the Saxonwold case is open here because that constitutes in our view, the scene of the crime, not the Saxonwold Shebeen, the compound on No 1 Saxonwold Drive."Maimane said he had also laid similar charges against Zuma's son Duduzane, Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane as well as certain members of the Gupta family.
