ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe told journalists on the sidelines that the meeting was at times difficult but quite important for the health of the ANC moving forward.One elder who did not want to be named told News24 that president Jacob Zuma lashed out at stalwarts for discussing their concerns and experiences in attempting to raise their worries about the direction the party was taking in the media."I think this thing is going to be problematic if you go to the media" is what the president is said to have told more than 30 veterans who took part in the meeting.'Harsh allegations and gentle pleas'He sounded like he was attempting to threaten us, to stop us from going public, said a stalwart.But before that representations were made to the NWC by author Wally Serote and Reverend Frank Chikane who explained why the stalwarts wanted to meet current leaders in the ANC and spoke to the "For the Sake of our Future" document, which was compiled by the leaders, its objectives and ways towards their achievement.Mantashe and national chairperson Baleka Mbete also addressed those in the room before individuals were given a chance to share their thoughts with their fellow comrades.Rivonia trialist Denis Goldberg was also in the room. He told News24 he was there to speak on behalf of his two other counterparts Ahmed Kathrada and Andrew Mlangeni."There was some harsh talking and some gentle talking, harsh allegations and gentle pleas for renewal," said Goldberg.Although he refused to reveal much about the meeting he said some reminisced about the old ANC while others shared their hopes for the party going forward.A stalwart who refused to be named said Goldberg had some harsh words for the leadership, claiming he said if they didn't acknowledge that they had brought the organisation into disrepute then there would be no renewal for the 104-year-old movement.One veteran said he was not surprised by how events unfolded on Monday, explaining that there could be no real outcome until further discussion took place.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
