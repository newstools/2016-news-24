He criticised the ANC for trying to resolve their concerns "administratively".DOWNLOAD the full Public Protector report on state capture hereThe veterans had called for the party to hold a consultative conference to discuss the political crisis in the ANC.Last week, the 101 long-standing ANC members called on the party to change its ways to regain society&rsquo;s trust.
