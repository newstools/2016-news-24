That could happen.&ldquo;But the relationship will always be governed by institutional arrangements and legal principles that are applicable to both our offices.&rdquo;In August, Dintwe gave evidence in Nhleko&rsquo;s Constitutional Court bid to have McBride removed from the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid).He said in an affidavit that there was a need for &ldquo;executive authority&rdquo; over Ipid, and that Nhleko&rsquo;s removal of a standing Ipid head was only legally offensive if it would stop Ipid from discharging its legal duties.Nhleko's bid was therefore not &ldquo;political interference&rdquo; and suggestions to the contrary were speculative and not based on scientific research, he argued.The Constitutional Court ruled on September 6 that Nhleko did not have the legal power to suspend McBride. The court declared McBride&rsquo;s suspension invalid and set it aside.Parliament gives Dintwe the nodDintwe received the National Assembly&rsquo;s approval for the vacant Inspector General of Intelligence post on Tuesday. His candidacy was approved with 299 votes in favour, and 14 against. No MPs abstained.Only the EFF objected to Dintwe's appointment.After almost two years, three failed interview processes, and 10 shortlisted candidates, it was up to President Jacob Zuma to approve Dintwe&rsquo;s selection.Joint standing committee on intelligence chairperson Charles Nqakula told the National Assembly that they had received the lowest number of applications in the last process.This was the fourth time they had tried to fill the position, probably due to the start-stop process.Nqakula told News24 on Monday that the matter of Dintwe's testimony for the police in the Ipid matter should have been raised during interviews with the candidates.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
