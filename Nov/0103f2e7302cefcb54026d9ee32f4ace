Who better to take inspo from than the fashion icons of the time? THE DENIM JACKET Whether you like it oversized or cropped, the denim jacket is a wardrobe essential. While it’s always been a staple, it returns this season as the ultimate throw-on piece. Take styling tips from Tyra Banks and wear it oversized with a turn up at the sleeve. Pair it with a basic tee, leggings and sneaks for easy on-the-go style. A sleek ponytail and retro-shape shades complete the look. THE DENIM SHORTS Yo Mariah, you’re on fire! Excuse the 90s throwback, but Mariah is owning this classic combo. Pair mid or high waisted denim shorts with a white shirt for effortless off-duty style. A gypsy-style blouse keeps the look modern and balances out your silhouette. Don’t forget the Wayfarers. THE DENIM MINI The A-line skirt is experiencing a major style revival, with the denim mini being top of our shopping list for the season. Take your cue from a very-90s Naomi Campbell and pair a zip or button up denim A-line mini with a graphic tee. Wear it with white sneakers or a pair of cool slides and keep the accessories simple.
