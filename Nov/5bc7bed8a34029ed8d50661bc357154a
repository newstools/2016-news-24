The Moroccan delegation quit the one-day summit in Malabo as Rabat is attempting to rejoin the African Union which it left in 1984 - when it was then called the Organisation of African Unity - to protest the admission of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic declared by the Polisario.In 1991, the United Nations brokered a ceasefire between the two sides.But a promised referendum to settle the status of the vast desert territory home to half a million people has yet to materialise.Morocco's latest move was criticised on Equatorial Guinea's Africa 24 network, which is close to the government."Morocco has partnerships with Central Africa, West Africa and Southern Africa. We cannot allow such a blow", said one commentator.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
