"It is a failure of the international refugee response system that other options are not available."The report says Kenya should lift its November 30 deadline to close the camp, which has existed for a quarter-century and holds more than 250 000 people. It sprawls in a dry, thorny region near the border with Somalia, where many born in the camp have never been.Groups including Doctors Without Borders, Human Rights Watch and the Norwegian Refugee Council also have expressed alarm in recent weeks over Kenya's reported pressure on Somali refugees to leave. They say large parts of Somalia remain insecure and aid for returnees is limited.Kenya has expressed concern that some Dadaab residents are used by the Somalia-based al-Shabab to launch attacks inside Kenya. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta has said repatriations will be voluntary and humane.The Refugees International report urges the UN refugee agency to give Dadaab residents "reliable information" about security conditions in Somalia as they weigh whether to return.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
