	     Port Elizabeth - The suspected middleman in Jayde
Panayiotou’s murder on Wednesday refused to answer any questions about his
boss’s alleged plot to have his wife killed. “I can’t
answer a question that may incriminate me,” Luthando Siyoni told the High Court
in Port Elizabeth shortly after court proceedings began at 12:00, following a
delay. Jayde’s
husband Christopher Panayiotou, Sinethemba Nenembe, and Zolani Sibeko are on
trial on charges of conspiring, kidnapping, robbing, and the killing of the
schoolteacher on April 21 last year. They pleaded not guilty. Siyoni,
who turned State witness, allegedly hired the hitman, Sizwezakhe Vumazonke. He
died in a Port Elizabeth hospital in September. Siyoni worked as a bouncer at
Panayiotou’s Infinity Cocktail Bar in Algoa Park. Prosecutor
Marius Stander asked Siyoni about a statement he had given to investigating
officer Kanna Swanepoel. In it he had
provided details about meeting Christopher Panayiotou through a man called Lendle, with whom he previously worked at a
club called Diamonds. In the
statement, Siyoni said Lendle and
Panayiotou visited him at a tavern he worked at in New Brighton and asked him
whether he was willing to work at the Infinity club. Shortly
after moving to Infinity, Siyoni said both Lendle
and Panayiotou approached him and asked him if he wanted to make money. The two
showed Siyoni a capsule called “Mandy” which contained a type of cocaine. In his
statement, Siyoni says he did not find it easy to sell the drug because users did
not know him and those who did use it, complained it was too strong. Months
later, Siyoni said Panayiotou asked him if he knew anyone who would kill
someone. “I
replied that I will look for someone. Nothing further was discussed. I do not
know at this stage who was to be killed,” the statement read. ‘I am not going to answer’ Siyoni
repeatedly responded, “I am not going to answer that question”, as Stander read
through the statement line by line, and asked Siyoni whether he had said this. “Will
you be answering any of my questions today, or none of them?” Stander retorted. “The
question I will answer is the question that relates to the fact that I was
given money and I handed that over to Sizwe,” Siyoni said. Stander
continued to read out contents of the statement to the court. Siyoni described
how he approached a man he knew in Motherwell, known as Lama. “I
believed that Lama himself would not kill the person, but was hoping that he
would know someone. I told Lama that my boss was doing the request. “I was
not supposed to tell that it was my boss, as Chris requested me not to do so as
he wanted to protect his identity,” the statement read. Siyoni
says he arranged for Panayiotou and Lama to meet. Nothing came of their
meeting, and Panayiotou “started to put me under pressure to find someone
else”. Siyoni
continued refusing to respond to Stander’s questions. The
matter was adjourned until Thursday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
