They pleaded not guilty.Sizwezakhe Vumazonke, believed to be the hitman Siyoni hired, died in a Port Elizabeth hospital in September. Siyoni had since turned State witness.Siyoni&rsquo;s girlfriend Babalwa Breakfast had said in her statements to police that he gave her a bag to count out the R50 000 for Vumazonke. She divided the remaining R30 000 into three equal stacks and placed them in the socks.During testimony in court last week, she denied any of this. At Stander&rsquo;s request, the court declared her a hostile witness. She was arrested and charged with perjury.Bekker told the court he had examined Vumazonke&rsquo;s wallet and found banking slips. Two slips showed deposits on April 20 and 22, with his name and surname as a reference.&nbsp;A receipt showed a cash deposit at an ATM.He received a set of Vumazonke&rsquo;s fingerprints for comparison.&nbsp;His left middle fingerprint matched a print on the back of a deposit slip. This confirmed that Vumazonke made the deposits.The trial continues.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
