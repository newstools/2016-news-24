It will not succeed," DA federal executive chairperson James Selfe said."In essence the interdict seeks to delay and frustrate the important work of the National Assembly to hold to account our public broadcaster which has in the past few months acted as a law unto itself."Selfe said the interdict sought to disqualify three members of the committee on the basis that they were biased; set aside the summons to produce documents to the committee; suspend all proceedings; and compel the National Assembly to reconstitute the committee.He described the application as a "costly and unnecessary exercise" by one man who is seeking to cling to power for his own sake.The matter will be argued in court on Friday.Hearings postponed by a weekThe committee was due to begin its witness interviews on Tuesday, but they have been postponed by a week due to Maguvhe's application.Maguvhe cited alleged "bias and prejudice" against him from opposition MPs Phumzile van Damme of the DA, EFF chief whip Floyd Shivambu and the IFP's Liezl van der Merwe.Meanwhile, 24 witnesses have been successfully contacted and will appear before the committee once the court case has been concluded.A further six, including former public protector Thuli Madonsela, declined for a number of reasons including travel commitments around the time scheduled for the hearings.Committee chairperson Vincent Smith said he was confident that Parliament would win the court case against Maguvhe, and would be "ready to roll" thereafter.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
