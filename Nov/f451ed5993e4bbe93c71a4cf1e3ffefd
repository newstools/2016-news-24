Because it is a rumour, we are not prepared to glorify it and respond to it."He added: "What we know for a matter of fact is that we elected a national executive committee and President Zuma is the leader and we expect them to lead us up to the next conference."News24 earlier reported that at least three members of Zuma's Cabinet had led an impassioned call for him to step down or that the NEC vote to remove him.Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi and Public Works Minister Thulas Nxesi asked him to resign. They were strongly supported by ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu.&nbsp;WATCH: ANCKZN backs President Jacob Zuma amid NEC calls for his resignation @News24 pic.twitter.com/tksH7h7Je5&mdash; Kaveel Singh (@kaveels) November 28, 2016WATCH: ANCKZN backs President Jacob Zuma amid NEC calls for his resignation @News24 pic.twitter.com/tksH7h7Je5The president's alleged improper relationship with the Gupta family, the decline in ANC support during the local government elections and the Nkandla scandal were given as reasons for him to step down.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
