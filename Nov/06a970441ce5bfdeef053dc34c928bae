However, Judge Papi Masopa ruled that his confession had been made freely and voluntary.&nbsp;Court documents previously put Ndlovu's age at 23, however he rectified this in court.&nbsp;Ndlovu, Nkala and Mduduzi Mathibela Lawrence, 32, are on trial on charges of robbery with aggravating circumstances, rape, and murder.
