"She told me on Monday how she'd screamed her lungs out when the rat ran over her. The nurses apparently just told her to calm down and that she's not the only one with problems."According to Vaughan, the woman said she'd noticed bite marks on her legs."Patients in other wards also started screaming, probably after also seeing the rat.Hospital shocked"I'm not worried about adults, but what would have happened had it happened in babies' rooms?" Vaughan asked."What if it was a baby who had been bitten?"The hospital nursing manager, Ronel van der Watt, said they were shocked when the incident was brought to their attention."As a preventative measure, we immediately moved the patients from that ward, even though other patients and staff said they hadn't seen the rat."We also brought in a pest control company, who said after a thorough investigation that there had been no sign of a rat."With the recent heavy rains, the pest control company has been doing additional risk assessment."The hospital apologised for the inconvenience caused to the patient, Van der Watt said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
