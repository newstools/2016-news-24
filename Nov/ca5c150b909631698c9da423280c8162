Vusi.MthalaneTHERE is an outcry from many residents about the poor state of many roads from Hibberdene to Port Edward. Potholes everywhere. Ward councillors and residents have been reporting them since the beginning of the Ray Nkonyeni Municipality s new financial year, starting in July with very little reaction from the officials side. The problem is that the municipality has been struggling with the appointment of contractors to fix the potholes. They only relied on internal teams for maintenance and they are obviously fighting a losing battle. For example, the depot three road maintenance supervisor, Veronica Gunkel, is responsible for the area from St Mike s bridge to Trafalgar and with only two teams of five workers each, so it is no wonder we find ourselves in this position. In consultation with the responsible head of department, Sabatha Dlamini, I established that the contractors issue has been resolved and seven contractors will be deployed to all areas to fix potholes. This should start in early November. Residents are urged to report potholes again to services@rnm.gov.za and cc your ward councillor thereby ensuring your road will be listed for pothole repairs now.In addition you are also welcome to contact your depot road maintenance supervisor to report potholes. In depot three s case, contact Veronica Gunkel on 071 493 2930. This situation, which was allowed to develop, is totally unacceptable and rest assured, to prevent this from happening in future, the DA will hold the ruling party to account, including the accounting officer, Max Mbili. It is also mind-blowing that there was no communication whatsoever from the municipality in this regard.George Henderson DA Ward Councillor 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
