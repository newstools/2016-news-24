The group, aged between 18 and 20, allegedly abducted and raped the girl. She had been walking alone on Robert Sobukwe Road at about 20:00 when she was abducted by a man who took her to a shack where he and his friends repeatedly raped her. She was held overnight and released the next day.The teenager has since been placed in a safe house after a video of her began circulating on neighbourhood phones. The girl was allegedly on her way to the shop when she got wind of a video that had been filmed of her walking in the area. She ran back home and did not want to leave the house again.This was after a man claiming to be a journalist arrived at the girl's home asking to speak to her. He could not produce any proof, not even a notebook, to show that he was a journalist. He left, but two other people also came to the house to ask about her.This raised concerns for the girl's safety because some of the people accused of being involved in the attack are still at large.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
