Paramedics and the fire department were at the scene of the accident. Netcare 911 spokesperson Chris Botha said that one vehicle veered across the centre median and collided with another vehicle, but more details will be available after an investigation. Paramedics found the road littered with accident debris and the twisted frames of the vehicles, the damage consistent with that of a high impact collision. After triaging they found that two people were in a serious condition while two other had moderate injuries. The driver of one of the vehicles was still trapped in the twisted frame of his SUV, said Botha. While firefighters and the Netcare 911 rescue officer used the jaws of life to extricate the seriously injured man, medics worked tirelessly to stabilise the patients. After the wounded were treated at the scene, medics transported them to various hospitals. - Supplied. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
