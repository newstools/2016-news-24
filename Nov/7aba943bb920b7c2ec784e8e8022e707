It&rsquo;s &lsquo;Home Affairs&rsquo; here, people call this office Home Affairs. Or &lsquo;hospital&rsquo;. &ldquo;I have an open-door policy. I talk to everyone and I listen to everyone. We are making sure that we empower emerging production houses and we are targeting all provinces and we want people to produce programming in their own languages.&rdquo; One example of preferential treatment cited by many sources is Ndaba and Ntshaba&rsquo;s proposed new show, The Healers, a mythical yet futuristic drama featuring mermaids.One SABC insider said the Special Projects department&rsquo;s Jacqui Hlogwane helped write the proposal for the show.Asked about this, Motsoeneng replied: &ldquo;That is a good question. The role of the SABC is to guide and also to empower all these emerging media houses.&rdquo;Ndaba has also been linked to a new wedding show and a new soap opera pitched to Motsoeneng, according to four current and former SABC officials.The wedding show was initially rejected by SABC commissioning editors because Ndaba owns a wedding planning business and they felt the show promoted it.Motsoeneng said he encouraged Ndaba&rsquo;s business success.One SABC insider said Motsoeneng had been heard stating: &ldquo;Somizi [Mhlongo] must come, Danie [Swart] and Jacqui [Hlongwane] will help him with his proposal.&rdquo;Ndaba and Ntshaba did not respond to questions.&ldquo;We want former actors to be owners of their own productions ... Transformation at the SABC is not negotiable,&rdquo; Motsoeneng said.Independent producers, however, say Motsoeneng is doing untold damage to the industry by throwing out the RFP system.The Independent Producers&rsquo; Organisation (IPO), which represents &ldquo;the majority of the television producers supplying content to broadcasters in South Africa&rdquo;, said in a statement: &ldquo;The IPO is aware of Hlaudi Motsoeneng&rsquo;s parallel commissioning process for his chosen handful of aspirant producers. &ldquo;They are often actors or recognised industry persons, who are not experienced producers, and have themselves reached out to numerous of our members, requesting &lsquo;assistance&rsquo; in their significant pre-allocated budgets, since they lack the necessary production experience.&ldquo;As a result, the allocated funds would essentially be given to &lsquo;middle men and women&rsquo; who are given credits they are not qualified for.&rdquo;The statement says the independent production sector fought hard for independent commissioning, and fair and transparent procedures, and this has opened the door &ldquo;to unfair and corrupt commissioning practices that were a hallmark of a dated broadcaster in days long gone.&rdquo;Motsoeneng said in response: &ldquo;It will be misleading to say production houses are unhappy. Maybe your sources are not prepared for transformation.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
