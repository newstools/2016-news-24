The power and security vacuum left the country a breeding ground for militias and militants including the ISIS group and al-Qaeda affiliates &mdash; and it has made Libya a gateway for thousands of migrants from Africa and elsewhere seeking to cross the Mediterranean to Italy.Since 2014, Libya has been split between rival governments and parliaments based in the western and eastern regions, each backed by different militias and tribes. A U-brokered deal in December to create a unity government has failed because the UN-backed government has been unable to win the endorsement of Libya's internationally recognized Parliament, which is a prerequisite to assume power."The situation continues to deteriorate and innocent civilians continue to bear the brunt of the fighting between the warring factions vying for control of Libyan territory," Bensouda said. "The current state of affairs, in which civilians are victimised, is completely unacceptable."The prosecutor again urged the Libyan government to do everything possible to have Seif al-Islam Gadhafi, the late dictator's son, handed over to the ICC. The court issued an arrest warrant for Gadhafi in 2011 on preliminary charges of crimes against humanity, murder and persecution for being part of the inner circle of his father's regime, which used lethal force against demonstrators in 2011.She said Gadhafi remains in Zintan, which is controlled by a militia opposed to the UN-backed government of national accord.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
