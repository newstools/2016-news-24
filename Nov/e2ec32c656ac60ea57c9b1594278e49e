She was presented with The Second Satyagraha Award for her contribution as Public Protector.&nbsp; She had compared Maine to the orange-flavoured juice&rsquo;s tubby mascot.&nbsp; She said in an interview with the SABC&rsquo;s Question Time on October 27: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised when somebody like Oros&hellip; There is a guy that they call Oros. Well I don&rsquo;t know what is his real name. What is his real name?&rdquo; she asked her interviewer.'Drama queen'&nbsp;The ANC Youth League on Monday called Madonsela &ldquo;a drama queen&rdquo; who needed &ldquo;to rest in peace&rdquo;.The league said her "State of Capture" report was intended to &ldquo;further enhance the agenda of the Democratic Alliance&rdquo; and bring President Jacob Zuma down.According to a Mail &amp; Guardian report, Maine said Madonsela was a DA puppet.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re calling for lady to rest in peace. It&rsquo;s like she is still the Public Protector. It&rsquo;s like she is not finished with what her handlers would have wanted her to finish. She must rest in peace and allow the new Public Protector to do her work,&rdquo; Maine said.He criticised Madonsela for referring to him as &ldquo;Oros&rdquo;, a name opposition parties used to tease him.&ldquo;She said she does not know my name and referred to me as Oros, so I don&rsquo;t know her name as well. Others are calling her a spy or big nose. I don&rsquo;t know her name,&rdquo; Maine said.Madonsela said it was obvious that Maine took offence at being called Oros.&ldquo;Someone had told me that a certain Oros has said something and I responded to the Oros. You know that the former mayor of Pretoria is Sputla [Ramokgopa]. I thought that Oros was somebody&rsquo;s name or a nickname that was acceptable.&ldquo;I did not even know that was the name of that person, it turns out from what I heard today, that that was his name and he felt that I attacked him,&rdquo; said Madonsela.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
