That is the oath I have taken from the commencement of my career."There has been growing calls for Abrahams to step down or face an inquiry into his fitness to hold office, after he withdrew charges against Gordhan on Monday.ReasonsREAD: I'm not captured or incompetent - AbrahamsHe is due to appear before Parliament's portfolio committee on justice and correctional services on Friday over the handling of the charges against Gordhan.When asked if he would consider issuing an apology to the public, he said expected the portfolio committee to ask him that as well."I don't think it's necessary for me to answer that question here."Of course I expect the committee to ask as well.
