In the report Madonsela points out that Zuma might have violated the Executive Ethics Act by not acting when one of his ministers made allegations that he was offered a post by the Gupta family, who are close friends of Zuma.Zuma is also alleged to have allowed the Guptas to influence contracts in state-owned enterprises and key decisions including the appointment of ministers.On Monday EFF leader Julius Malema, in calling for active citizenship and the removal of President Jacob Zuma, complained about what he called the ANC's voting cattle in Parliament.DA motion 'frivolous ritual'Mantashe said if the ANC MPs voted according to their conscience it would hurt the ANC."We all get into lists of the ANC and go to Parliament. I don't expect any member of the opposition to vote according to their conscience but the position of their parties."The ANC secretary general also criticised the DA for again putting the motion on the agenda, saying the party's actions were becoming routine."The DA has now made this an annual frivolous ritual and it's fast losing its meaning," said Mantashe.He said the motion had no chance of succeeding and that the bid by the DA was a sign of growing arrogance among opposition parties in the country."To say they believe they can command ANC members of Parliament, to say they must vote against the president of the ANC and the republic, this is a reflection of growing arrogance," said Mantashe.He said the ANC was not hypocritical like the EFF, slamming the red berets' leader for comments he made outside a Newcastle court on Monday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
