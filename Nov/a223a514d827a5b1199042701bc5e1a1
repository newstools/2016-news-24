In his letter, Gordhan stated: "You are accordingly advised to ensure that the contract is cancelled; Integritron Integrated Solutions and its associates are restricted from conducting business with government, and investigate disciplinary charges against members of the bid committees and the accounting officer."At a subsequent court hearing, Treasury official Tshitangano stated that Gordhan had "advised Masutha to consider&hellip; cancelling the contract" and referred to Gordhan&rsquo;s letter as "an advice to Masutha to consider the options referred to therein". Treasury&rsquo;s advocate told the court that it did not have the authority to cancel the contract or blacklist the company. The advocate further stated that National Treasury had never threatened to cancel any contract.Retief held that these testimonies should carry more weight than News24&rsquo;s interpretation of Gordhan&rsquo;s letter.He added: "However, I hasten to add that I do not blame News24 for this mistake, given the fact that Gordhan&rsquo;s letter could have been interpreted in more ways than one, in addition to [Sasstec CEO Geoff] Greyling&rsquo;s assertion to the effect that the letter was not merely 'advice'."Retief dismissed several of Sasstec&rsquo;s other complaints.Sasstec lodged a complaint with the office of the Press Ombudsman.Visit www.presscouncil.org.za for the full finding. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
