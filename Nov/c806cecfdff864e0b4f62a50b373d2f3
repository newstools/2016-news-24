International oil companies and state governors also attended Tuesday's meeting.Ledum Mitee of the Niger Delta Forum says civil society wanted the government "to commit to some credible process of dialogue."Instead, he says, Buhari said he would consider what they said, align that with a report expected from security agencies and then make an "appropriate response."Attacks this year have cut up to a million barrels a day from the usual 2.2-million-barrel production, throwing Africa's biggest economy into recession.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
