This money ostensibly helped the Guptas finance the Optimum deal.Information contained in the "State of Capture" report included cellphone records placing Molefe near the Guptas' home in Saxonwold 19 times between August 5 and November 17, 2015.Cellphone evidence also showed that Molefe and Ajay Gupta, the eldest of three Gupta brothers, made 58 telephone calls to one another between August 2015 and March 2016.Records also detailed calls between Molefe and Ronica Ragavan, a long-time Gupta associate who was recently appointed acting CEO of Oakbay Investments, the family's main holding company.Ragavan called Molefe on April 11 this year, the same day when Eskom&rsquo;s pre-payment was granted to Tegeta.Almost a billion rand worth of prepayments by Eskom to Gupta-owned Tegeta Resources &amp; Energy for a coal tender that was allegedly used to buy Optimum Coal Mine (OCM) from Glencore may be corrupt, illegal and amount to fruitless and wasteful expenditure, according to the Public Protector's report.Report belongs to Public ProtectorZuma had also initially stated that he was not given a chance to reply to allegations that the Guptas had been involved in the short-lived appointment of Des van Rooyen as finance minister in December.The report, which followed the first phase of a probe into whether the family was benefiting financially from its proximity to Zuma, was released on Wednesday after Zuma withdrew a court application to block its release on the grounds of not being given a chance to respond to allegations.A lengthy transcript of an interview Madonsela conducted with Zuma in the presence of his attorney Michael Hulley was released by the public protector's office with the report.Mkhwebane started as Public Protector on October 17 when Madonsela's seven-year term came to end.She issued a statement on Thursday night to stress that the report belonged to the Public Protector as an institution, pulling control over information on the report back into the fold.Comment was increasingly being sought from Madonsela, with not much forthcoming from the public protector's office.In the statement issued on Thursday night, Mkhwebane said she "took over the office with all its successes and failures".Asked whether the report was a success or failure, the response from her offices to News24 was: "Neither of the two. The rule of law will be the determinant. "24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
