Surely this cannot be accepted?&nbsp;&ldquo;If someone burns a school, that will be felt for many generations to come. We already don&rsquo;t have as many universities as we need.&rdquo;Mahlobo said protesting students were raising genuine and important concerns, and the country should rally behind them as it was a matter of national interest.Mahlobo said the main reason behind any major protest was almost always a lack of communication and action on the part of a leader.&ldquo;Before we have security problems, we have governance problems.&ldquo;If there is proper communication with the people and government, security services would not need to be called in,&rdquo; he said.Peace-loving peopleMahlobo said South Africans were generally peace-loving people. When protests escalated and became violent, it was usually due to &ldquo;rogue elements&rdquo; operating within groups raising genuine concerns through protest.&nbsp;&ldquo;They are raising issues, but those in government must respond to those issues in time.&rdquo;University of Johannesburg Professor Jane Duncan said the security personnel deployed to deal with student protests were making matters worse.&ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t rush to label these threats as national security threats. Are we at that stage? I would argue that no argument has been made that we are.&rdquo;She said crime intelligence, rather than state intelligence, should investigate protests. Treating violence on campus as a national security matter would only add fuel to the fire.The State Security Agency needed to do more to convince the public that it was working in their best interests.&ldquo;It has taken secrecy to unimaginable extremes. The public can&rsquo;t be expected to trust the State Security Agency when its rules are not known,&rdquo; she said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
