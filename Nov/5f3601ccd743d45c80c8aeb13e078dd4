Durwakhah is currently involved in a labour dispute with the broadcaster at the Labour Court. Francois said her work requires 100% confidentiality.Twenty-four&nbsp;other witnesses were successfully&nbsp;contacted by Parliament's evidence leader, and will appear before the committee. Four members of the "SABC 8" will appear as one group.Smith informed the committee that witness testimonies would have to be postponed by a week, as SABC chairperson Mbulaheni Maguvhe had filed for an emergency interdict over the weekend.Maguvhe, who is the last remaining board member, cited "bias and prejudice" from opposition MPs Phumzile van Damme, Floyd Shivambu and the IFP's Liesl van der Merwe.Smith told the committee that Parliament's lawyers would argue the merits of Maguvhe's case on Friday in the Western Cape High Court.He was confident that the court would rule in their favour, and in that event, the committee will be "ready to roll" 24 hours later.In camera testimonyThe SABC also failed to deliver pertinent documents to the committee by the requested date, November 21, he said.MPs registered their displeasure at the SABC's failure to comply and said the committee needs to use all the tools it can to release the requested documents.Another issue raised by MPs was current Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane's desire to have three staff members testify on behalf of her office in camera.The DA's Van Damme said her predecessor Madonsela's&nbsp;2014 report on the SABC, When Governance and Ethics Fail, was a public document, and they should therefore defend it publicly and not behind closed doors.EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said it was disrespectful of Mkhwebane to try and dictate to the committee regarding the interview processes.Smith described the start of the process as the beginning of a marathon, a seemingly daunting task that would ultimately be fulfilling.The committee has until December 15 to compile a report and present it before the National Assembly.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
