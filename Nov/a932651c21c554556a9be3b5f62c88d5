However, Motale claimed he had to contend with improper managerial interference in editorial affairs, including news content and processes to hire journalists, Sanef said.Sanef said it believed that the termination of service should at all times follow laid down labour relations procedures, "which include internal processes, failing which the matter can then be taken to the CCMA and the Labour Court".News24 earlier reported that Motale intended to challenge his dismissal in court. Motale was suspended four weeks ago. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
