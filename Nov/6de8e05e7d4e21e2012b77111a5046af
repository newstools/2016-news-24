The three houses were identified for evictions.He said the matter would be investigated.Stevenson alleged that soldiers ignored a police lieutenant colonel on the scene."The SAPS must take this up with the SANDF as a matter of urgency.&nbsp;We cannot allow mutiny to break out in South Africa," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
