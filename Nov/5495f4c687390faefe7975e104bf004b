The fishing industry alleged it was an effort to "enrich" Hermanus businessman James Booi, and that the permit had been issued against protocol and advice of government scientific advisers, the paper reported.Molapo said the State would pay 50% of the applicants' costs after Zokwana conceded that his and the other respondents' conduct between January and August this year had been tardy.This was particularly due to their handling of the industry applicants' requests for access to the record of decision.Their failure to make it available timeously contributed, in Zokwana's view, to the industry applicants having to serve an urgent application in August, immediately before the local government elections.The vessel was being used to catch horse mackerel in Namibia and would not be able to be deployed in South African waters before December."The minister does wish to confirm and emphasise his ongoing commitment to pursuing the socio-economic horse mackerel experiment in 2017," Molapo said.Zokwana intended to restructure the horse mackerel industry to ensure local processing and sale of the fish. Currently, the entire quota was exported, without local job creation and beneficiation.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
