"We have been reliably informed that the department could have saved millions of rands had the ICT tender been awarded to an alternative service provider," the party said in a statement on Sunday. The Gauteng education department said they would comment on the matter later.&nbsp;DA Gauteng spokesperson for education Khume Ramulifho said the department was being served with a court interdict after a service provider challenged the awarding of a school nutrition tender, adding the tender was only put out to bid for 15 days &ndash; as opposed to the 30 days required by legislation. &nbsp;Ramulifho said Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi must explain why procurement processes were not followed correctly and contracts unfairly awarded. "The department is tarnishing Premier David Makhura's promises of beating corruption by repeatedly not awarding tenders in line with the Public Finance Management Act and National Treasury regulations," he claimed.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
