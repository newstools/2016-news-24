Cameroon has battled the extremist group since 2014 and has joined Chad, Nigeria, Niger and Benin in setting up a joint force against Boko Haram.The regional counter-offensive has helped the Nigerian military retake swathes of territory from the insurgents, but the jihadist group still poses a security threat to civilians.
