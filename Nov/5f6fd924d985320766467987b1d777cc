In 2009 the protector's office and auditors investigated Makuleni over tenders that were irregularly awarded.SAWS workers told the Public Protector how the service's acting general manager, Khanyisa Hanisi, bought Makuleni a Cellini Serenade designer handbag for R3&nbsp;795 and claimed the money back.Hanisi bought the handbag using her own credit card for Makuleni as a present for completing her MBA, the Mail &amp; Guardian reported."This would have been an admirable gesture had the acting GM [general manager] not later claimed this money from [the weather service]. Not knowing the full details of the claim, finance staff were made to process the claim," the workers' complaint read.Makuleni was appointed CEO on April 1, 2007, and had just five months left on her contract.SAWS spokesperson Hannelee Doubell told Netwerk24 she could not comment on the matter.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
