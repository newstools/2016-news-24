The information that we have at the moment suggests that there were problems with new switchgear that Eskom had installed. We are, however, awaiting an official report from them as to what went wrong and what measures they have put in place to prevent a reoccurrence, she said.She said the unexpected outages were bad for residents and bad for business. It is critical that outages are minimised and communicated properly, she added.The power supply to the whole of the Kouga region was interrupted for about four hours on Saturday morning and again for an hour on Sunday.
