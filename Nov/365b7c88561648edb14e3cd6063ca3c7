The three-minute video was shared widely on the internet. Ellissy's network, Al-Hayat TV, later pulled the video from its websites.Egypt has waged a wide-scale crackdown on dissent since the military led the 2013 overthrow of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, the country's first freely elected leader. Thousands of his supporters, as well as a number of prominent secular activists, have been jailed.The authorities have banned several activists from traveling, or have frozen their assets. On Wednesday, they prevented Aida Seif el-Dawla, a prominent rights activist, from traveling to Tunisia."The decision to ban people's travel has evolved into a punishment tool and not a legal procedure," said Ziad Akl, senior researcher at the Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies.In a separate development Thursday, an Egyptian appeals court reduced a three-year sentence against poet and writer Fatma Naoot on charges of contempt of Islam. She was instead given a six-month suspended sentence, and will not be imprisoned.The accusation against Naoot stemmed from a Facebook post criticizing the slaughter of animals for the Muslim feast of Eid al-Adha. She denies the charge of insulting religion.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
