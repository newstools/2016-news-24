Masikane, that the state was opposing the release of all the accused on bail on a number of grounds.These were that if released they will pose a danger to public safety, will attempt to evade their trial, will destroy or conceal evidence or interfere with the state&rsquo;s case, undermine the objectives of the criminal justice system and disturb public order, peace and security.&ldquo;The motive for all these crimes was purely financial,&rdquo; he said.Truter said the state will lead evidence by Hawks investigator Warrant Officer Nelson Naicker to show that before they were killed, life insurance policies were taken out on the lives of each of the murder victims as well as the attempted murder victim (Gwala).&ldquo;On different dates after their lives were insured the victims were killed, and an attempt was made to kill Gwala,&rdquo; he saidTruter said the three women &mdash; Khoza, Zaco and Zuma &mdash; had been named as the beneficiaries of the policies in respect of which claims were submitted to various insurance companies, and in some instances payment was made, he said.He said the state intends to prove that the five accused had conspired with each other as well as others to kill the victims so they could claim the insurance.Truter said the state has &ldquo;direct&rdquo; evidence implicating the accused consisting of the documented insurance claims, as well as evidence that will be given by section 204 (accomplice) witnesses.There is also circumstantial evidence linking them to the offences.The bail application will resume on November 14.Police have said if anyone has information that could assist them with their inquiries into the case they can contact Captain Mebra Nzimande at 082 702 0909 or Sergeant Jurgen Rencken at 071 481 3176.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
