The ANC was trying to "polish their marble" amid all the issues facing it, she said.EFF MP Moses Mbatha&nbsp;praised aspects of&nbsp;the bill too, but also expressed the wish that it could have been presented on a different platform.He said the fund could be open to mismanagement and corruption.Fund for bail, fines, debt collectionThe Justice Administered Fund Bill is designed to regulate the management, control, investment and utilisation of certain types of money on behalf of the state, Jeffery told the House.The Department of Justice and Constitutional Development manages funds on behalf of third parties that relate to bail hearings, fines, debt collection and other court payments."When someone posts bail, where does this money go, you may ask?" Jeffery said to the House.Jeffery said the department always handled that money according to the Public Finance Management Act, but the new legislation will mean better access for ordinary citizens and a move&nbsp;away from the&nbsp;need&nbsp;to carry&nbsp;cash."The bill may seem technical and uncontentious in nature but for those people waiting for money to be transferred timeously, it provides a good legislative framework."In a later debate brought by the ANC on the socio-economic empowerment of young women, DA chief whip John Steenhuisen said the ANC's lead speech didn't address the topic at all."We've prepared a debate on the topic, yet the honourable member sounds like she's giving a speech to an ANC branch meeting," he said referring to ANC MP Zephroma Dlamini-Dubazana."It's excruciating. It's worse than the Idols Wooden Mic contest."The Justice Administered Fund Bill passed on Tuesday with no objections and will now be debated in the National Council of Provinces.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
