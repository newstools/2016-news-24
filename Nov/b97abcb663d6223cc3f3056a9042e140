She said they failed to treat her properly and that they were negligent.She said, as a result of this negligence, she could not walk or function independently and would require knee surgery and various forms of therapy and special adaptive aids and devices.'No prospect of success on appeal'The fund has conceded that the insured driver was negligent and that his negligence caused the collision.However, the MEC delivered a special plea in which it was alleged that the fund is obliged to compensate Mkhitha for any loss or damage suffered as a result of any bodily injury caused by or arising from the driving of a motor vehicle, if the injury is due to the negligence or other wrongful act by the driver or owner of the vehicle.The MEC said the damages Mkhitha suffered arose from the driving of a motor vehicle and the department was not liable for any damages sustained in the collision.The MEC also denied that medical staff at BOH were negligent. &nbsp;However, Mkhitha said negligence of the MEC's employees was an "unforeseeable intervening act that caused her to suffer harm, independent of the negligence of the insured driver; and that the consequences of the negligence of the MEC's employees were not caused by and did not arise from the driving of the insured vehicle, and were also too remote to render the fund liable for those damages".The SCA dismissed the application for leave to appeal saying, "it is plainly bad and had no prospect of success on appeal".&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
