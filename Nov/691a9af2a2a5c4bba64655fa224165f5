Candyce.KrishnaA 23-YEAR-OLD man was recently convicted of rape and sentenced to life for the rape of his five-year-old niece.The girl was left with her maternal uncle at their home in Ezimangweni Ward, Louisiana in Port Shepstone on 7 March. When the child s mother arrived back home at 11.25am she noticed her brother s trouser zip was undone and her little girl s underwear was pulled down. Suspecting that something was amiss, she took the child to hospital where it was confirmed the child had been raped, said police spokesperson Captain Vincent Pandarum.The rape case was assigned to Detective Constable Nurse Goodness Magubane of the Port Shepstone Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences unit (FCS) for investigation. The victim s uncle was arrested and stood trial. The matter was escalated from the Port Shepstone Magistrate s Court to the Port Shepstone Regional Court where he was convicted of rape and sentenced to life. He was also declared unfit to possess a firearm. The majority of sexual offences on children are committed by persons known to them. We welcome the sentence imposed by the court and hope it serves as a deterrent to other like-minded criminals. A relative, who was supposed to have looked after the little girl, betrayed her trust and violated her so he deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison where he will not be able to harm children anymore, said Brigadier Bongani Sibiya, acting Ugu Cluster Commander. - Supplied.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
