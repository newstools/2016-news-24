We've already been downgraded to negative. This is interpreted by some in the ANC as a sign to go for it."Matekga said it made no sense for those in Zuma's camp to not want to deal with those who had been fighting him and wanting to see him gone.In its report, the Sunday Times alluded to changes in the president's executive only taking place after the party&rsquo;s 105th birthday celebrations in January 2017, but Matekga said he saw no reason to wait."January 8 is not an important barometer of Zuma's leadership," said Matekga.Zuma &lsquo;already laying the groundwork&rsquo;He believes the president has already begun laying the groundwork towards getting supporters on his side, explaining that he had visited branches across the country to share his position with members.A key part of that message was, "to say government is under siege, that it's being held to ransom by the markets and the fears of regime change," Matekga said.The City Press reported that Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom stunned Zuma and his backers when he tabled a motion for him to step down at the national executive committee (NEC) meeting at the weekendLate Saturday night, the meeting had reportedly been adjourned with the discussion around a vote deferred to Sunday, the last day of the NEC sitting.City Press learnt that those set on removing Zuma were lobbying for a secret ballot to determine the president's fate. A secret ballot could be the nail in Zuma's coffin as it would empower those who fear a backlash.Saturday's decision to defer voting came as some objected to any vote last night taking place in the absence of many NEC members, who had been attending Ekurhuleni Mayor Mzwandile Masina's wedding in Stellenbosch on Saturday.The NEC has always been considered a safe space for Zuma as it was believed his supporters dominate the structure, the paper reported. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
