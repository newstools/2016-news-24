The National Assembly's rules were clear about the urgency with which a motion of no confidence in the president should be scheduled, Chief Whip John Steenhuisen said in a statement on Sunday."The Speaker must accord such motion of no confidence due priority and before scheduling it must consult with the leader of government business and the chief whip," Steenhuisen said, citing the relevant rule."The inexplicable delay which has dogged this motion has been raised in numerous fora, to no avail."Parliament's spokesperson Luzuko Jacobs did not respond to requests for comment.Steenhuisen said Speaker Baleka Mbete raised the matter at the start of the National Assembly programming committee on November 3, and said the request would receive prompt consideration.&nbsp;The DA proposed November 10 for the debate and little opposition was received."Despite this agreement, next week's programme circulated on Friday evening has omitted the motion of no confidence, thereby delaying it at least by another week."There was no reason why the motion could not proceed at the earliest possible convenience, he said, adding that Mbete was once again trying to shield President Jacob Zuma from accountability."We would have hoped that the embarrassing defeats suffered by the executive and Parliament, more particularly in our courts of law, would have shown the Speaker the futility of her delaying tactics."Sadly, Mbete doesn't learn. We believe this latest ploy will only embolden those high-ranking ANC parliamentarians that have chosen to break rank in recent times to now support our motion, and put a stop to the kleptocratic, indefensible Zuma presidency."Maimane last week said&nbsp;the coming week would be the country&rsquo;s "moment of reckoning"."We have to speak out against this attack on our Constitution and democracy and fire Jacob Zuma immediately. We must do this for our country and for generations to come," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
