	     A 20-year-old man has been killed after a wall collapsed on him at a home in Gardens. Paramedics arrived at the Scott Street residence and found a man lying next to a collapsed wall surrounded by members of the public, says ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring. “Paramedics assessed the man and found that he had sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life. They immediately began their treatment and initiated CPR and advanced life support treatment. Unfortunately, after 35 minutes, no vital signs returned and the man was declared dead on the scene,” he says. It is believed the man had been demolishing a wall when it collapsed on top of him. Local authorities were on scene for further investigations.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
