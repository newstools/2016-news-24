The proposed law appears to be "deliberately drafted to curtail civil society's ability to operate, and to stifle their ability to freely express themselves," said Kiai.There are more than 47 000 Egyptian NGOs in the North African country, and more than 100 foreign ones, according to the government."All of this is because there is a small number of organisations that play a suspicious role, and that do receive financing linked with an unclear agenda that could really hide malicious objectives against the Egyptian state," said Ahmed al-Tantawi, a member of the "25-30" group of lawmakers who call themselves the opposition.Officials and security services have aired suspicions since the January 2011 uprising that toppled longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak that civil society groups were plotting against Egypt at a time of heightened tensions with western countries.Rights groups have repeatedly accused Sisi's government of violations, including forced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and illegal detentions.Egyptian and foreign NGOs operating in the country are governed by a strict law which allows the government to supervise their activities and finances.In September a court froze the assets of five prominent human rights defenders and three NGOs for receiving foreign funds in a case dating from 2011.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
