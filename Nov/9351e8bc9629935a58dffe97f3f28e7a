Speculation was rife over whether President Jacob Zuma would survive a vote on either recalling him or stepping down as leader. Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi and Public Works Minister Thulas Nxesi asked Zuma to resign, News24 reported earlier on Monday. They were strongly supported by ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu.The president's alleged improper relationship with the Gupta family, the decline in ANC support during local government elections and the Nkandla scandal were used as bases for him to step down. The ANC NEC meeting, scheduled to end on Sunday, was extended to Monday as a "rough", "fierce" and "robust" debate over his fate had not been concluded. The briefing will be held at party headquarters, Luthuli House, in Johannesburg.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
