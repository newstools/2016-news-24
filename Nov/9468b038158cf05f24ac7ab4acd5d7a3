"The Cuba-SA agreement on health entered between Tata Nelson Mandela and Fidel Castro is a strong bond which we believe will continue to bear fruits," the ministry said. "Cuba is training our medical students and sent her citizens to practice medicine in our country. For that we are eternally grateful," said the statement, released by spokesperson Joe Maila. The training programme flowed from a bilateral agreement between the late president, Nelson Mandela, and Castro 20 years ago. Although lauded by some as a way to swell the number of doctors in South Africa, the programme has not been without controversy. Language difficulties, and curriculum gaps have been identified as problems by detractors. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
