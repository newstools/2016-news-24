Lt. Col. Mayi, the arresting officer of alleged middleman Luthando Siyoni, was grilled in the stand by Terry Price, for Panayiotou, and it is now the turn of the other officers who accompanied Siyoni during his arrest. Jump to bottom TP: Did you say it in your statement?&nbsp;DG: If I can read&nbsp;DG: "Constable Koen then informed me that the suspect willingly wanted to make a confession"&nbsp;DG: So that is what I asked, he was warned and may have a legal representative, and that is how I typed it.&nbsp;TP: You are putting a spin on it. That sentence says nothing about Koen being asked about the rights.&nbsp;DG: That is what I meant when I typed it&nbsp;TP: In what language did you speak to Koen?&nbsp;DG: Afrikaans and English&nbsp;TP: Are you saying you asked the same question in Afrikaans and English?&nbsp;DG: I said I spoke to him in both languages&nbsp;TP: Why did you do that?&nbsp;DG: I wanted to ensure that Mr Siyoni also understood&nbsp;TP: Siyoni told this court he had no idea where he was being taken or what he was supposed to do at that point in time.&nbsp;DG: That is untrue. We did tell him that we were going to take him for a confession, which he confirmed, and at that specific point in time, we did not know where we were taking him.&nbsp;TP: Did you have any reason to believe that this suspect had not been processed, or warned of his rights?&nbsp;DG: I just want to explain under process. This is warned, and when his fingerprints are taken and [he] is addressed about his rights to have legal representation.&nbsp;TP: Let me be more specific&nbsp;TP: Did you have any reason to believe he had not been warned at that time of his rights?&nbsp;DG: No, that is why I asked Koen&nbsp;TP: Why would you question Koen about it?&nbsp;DG: That is the right manner to do things&nbsp;TP: Surely, that has nothing to do with you&nbsp;DG: I did indicate that I did not want to drive halfway and find out that he needed a lawyer and have to turn back. It is part of my job.&nbsp;TP: Did you consider it important, therefore, that you asked Koen if he had been warned?&nbsp;DG: Yes, that is correct&nbsp;TP: Were you involved in the search for Jayde?&nbsp;DG: No&nbsp;TP: And did you and Koen ever say anything to each other about the case?&nbsp;DG: We may have spoken, I remember telling him he was working long hours&nbsp;TP: Did you know if they had suspects in mind?&nbsp;DG: Not at all. The first time was the night with Siyoni.&nbsp;TP: I want to put it to you, that the job that is normally done, is that a police officer who does not have knowledge of a case takes the suspect to a magistrate or police officer, and once done, they bring them back.&nbsp;DG: That is exactly what it was, and that is why I did it.&nbsp;TP: And what the person you are taking intends to do specifically, is none of your business&nbsp;DG: That is correct&nbsp;TP: You would certainly appreciate, that when a man is handed over to you, like Siyoni has been, he has already been processed by the team that hands him over.&nbsp;DG: Not always&nbsp;TP: Can you describe the charge office at Kabega Park. Is there a boardroom?&nbsp;DG: Yes&nbsp;TP: And there is a place where an attorney can consult with his client?&nbsp;DG: Yes&nbsp;TP: And in the same way, a police officer who wants to interview a suspect, can also do so in private?&nbsp;DG: Yes&nbsp;TP: And in the same way, that would be the same as most police charge offices?&nbsp;DG: Not that I can say&nbsp;TP: At Mount Road, is there a boardroom?&nbsp;DG: There is a pink room that they use&nbsp;TP: Your colleague Koen was investigating this matter&nbsp;DG: That is correct&nbsp;TP: And would I be correct that he would be part of an ongoing investigation into the murder of Jayde?&nbsp;DG: Yes&nbsp;[Greeff (DG) is sworn in]&nbsp;TP: I think for the translation [it] is taking a lot of time, can I ask that I ask the questions in English and he responds in Afrikaans?&nbsp;DG: I will let you know if I don't understand something&nbsp;TP: This is your statement, it was commissioned about five days after you took the suspect to Fort Beaufort&nbsp;DG: That is correct&nbsp;TP: And it was commissioned by your partner?&nbsp;DG: Yes&nbsp;TP: And she would have had to read it?&nbsp;DG: Yes&nbsp;(Derrick Spies/News24)&nbsp;Officer's evidence contradicts Panayiotou bouncer's claim of no sleep before confession&nbsp;The Eastern Cape High Court in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday heard how alleged middleman Luthando Siyoni's snoring kept one of the officers transporting him to Fort Beaufort awake. This emerged during testimony from Warrant Officer Dirk Ignatius Greeff, who had been responsible for transporting Siyoni to Fort Beaufort police station so that he could make his confession during the early hours of April 28 2015. The testimony contradicted Siyoni who alleged under cross-examination by Christopher Panayiotou's defence that he had not been able to get any sleep at all during his trip. Greeff told the court that he noticed Siyoni's eye was swollen when he had gone to collect him and had immediately asked him about it.&nbsp;ICYMI:&nbsp;Panayiotou trial witnesses hit kudu on their way to testify&nbsp;Two witnesses who were supposed to testify in the trial of Christopher Panayiotou and his co-accused were unable to appear after apparently hitting a kudu on the R75 while travelling to Port Elizabeth from Graaff-Reinet. State prosecutor Marius Stander asked if the Eastern Cape High Court in Port Elizabeth could adjourn slightly earlier than usual for lunch as neither Mncedi Gcukumana nor Andile Gusha, police officials who were scheduled to testify after Captain Willie Mayi, were available. Both men were injured over the weekend when they hit a kudu while travelling to Port Elizabeth to testify in court. Stander indicated that he was in the process of securing other witnesses to come and testify and would be in a position to resume in the afternoon. Earlier Advocate Terry Price SC, for the defence, once again grilled Mayi about procedure in the arrest of alleged middleman Luthando Siyoni.ICYMI:&nbsp;Jayde cop accused of being 'enforcer' for confessions&nbsp;The policeman who arrested the alleged middleman in the Jayde Panayiotou murder is known as "the enforcer", the High Court in Port Elizabeth heard on Monday. Terry Price, for murder-accused Christopher Panayiotou, referred to three other cases where Captain Willie Mayi had been accused of assaulting a suspect. He suggested to Mayi that the reason he was often called to take initial statements was because he was known as "the enforcer". He was questioning Mayi about claims that the alleged middleman, Luthando Siyoni, was assaulted and tortured after his arrest.&nbsp; Jump to top
