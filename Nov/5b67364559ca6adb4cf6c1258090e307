In Africa alone, 33 countries have anti-gay laws including Uganda, Nigeria, Sudan and Mauritania.UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon this week said the "tide is turning" in favor of LGBT rights as he received a prize from the Elton John AIDS foundation.Ban came under fire from many UN member-states including Russia when he decided in 2015 to extend benefits to the same-sex partners of UN employees. "I like to remind others that LGBT people are just that - they're people," Ban said in his acceptance speech."They are worth just as much as anyone else. And they are born with the same inalienable rights as everyone else."Muntarbhorn, who was appointed for a three-year term, is to carry out country visits, raise allegations of LGBT rights violations with governments and work to protect rights defenders.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
