Jusa said a letter, purportedly from the teacher, was circulated on social media. In it, the teacher expressed remorse and volunteered to undergo an awareness programme to learn more about Islam, it said. &nbsp;&ldquo;While we acknowledge and take into account the teacher&rsquo;s regret in good faith, it is a matter of alarm and dismay that in this day of a new South Africa we still have teachers who harbour notions of hate and seem to remain callously insensitive to the religious beliefs of learners under their charge.&rdquo;&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
