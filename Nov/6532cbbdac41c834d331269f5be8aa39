The union had met to discuss the state of the Post Office, Telkom, the &ldquo;State of Capture&rdquo; report, the SABC, the tripartite alliance, and the ANC succession debate.&ldquo;We can confirm that this is a debate we are currently having in all our structures,&rdquo; he said.Recent developments in the country were making it difficult to focus on real issues, such as the triple challenges of inequality, unemployment, and poverty.Nehawu, Cosatu&rsquo;s largest affiliate, called for Zuma to resign on November 1, it said in a statement following its national executive committee meeting. The situation with Zuma had become untenable, it said.&lsquo;Our wounds are fresh&rsquo;The CWU believed workers needed to decide their leadership, guided by class interests, instead of on tradition and culture.&ldquo;Our wounds are still extremely fresh from the blank cheque we signed going to Polokwane and in Mangaung,&rdquo; Tshabalala said. He was referring to the ANC conferences at which Zuma was elected ANC president and then re-elected.The CWU said it was tired of empty promises and wanted a candidate who would deliver on a number of issues. In the short-term, these included banning labour brokers, tightening section 197 of the Labour Relations Act, which deals with employee rights when a business changes owners, scrapping e-tolls, and implementing the National Health Insurance.In the long-term, the union wanted land redistribution addressed and the nationalisation of key industries, including mines and banks.The union complained of those in power failing to honour the promises they made when wooing members. Tshabalala said serious questions needed to be asked of the tripartite alliance.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
