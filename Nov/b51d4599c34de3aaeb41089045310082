Gubio is 95km northeast of Maiduguri, the birthplace of Boko Haram and headquarters of the military campaign to halt the insurgency.Boko Haram recently has stepped up attacks after a months-long lull caused by a leadership struggle in the Islamic State-affiliated group.Tuesday's explosion follows four suicide bombings in three weeks in Maiduguri, which is home to nearly as many refugees from Boko Haram as residents.Two of those suicide bombers tried, but failed, to enter a camp housing more than 16 000 refugees.The uprising has killed more than 20 000 people over seven years and forced some 2.6 million people out from their homes.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
