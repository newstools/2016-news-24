Speaking to News24, he said for those seeking to see the end of Zuma's presidency the answer was with the national executive committee (NEC), which was to hold its last meeting for 2016 on Saturday."At the end of the day it will take a vote from the NEC, which is the most powerful decision-making body outside of the elective conference, for Zuma to go," he said.It will take the NEC, not the integrity committee to accomplish anything, said Maluleke.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
