Then things began to fall apart, resulting in the situation getting out of control at the expense of the animals' health and well-being,&rdquo; Meyer said.&nbsp;Meyer said the cats were all over the house and there was cat faeces everywhere.She said the cats' litter box was overflowing and consequently the cats were defecating all over the house.&nbsp;There were a lot of kittens in one room, with excrement all over the carpets.&nbsp;Meyer described the smell as unbearable.The cats were examined and many had a severe infectious disease and sick cats were not separated from the healthy ones.The owner was unable to provide the SPCA with medical records, adding the cats were also not vaccinated against rabies.&nbsp;&ldquo;In another room, we found a dead kitten amongst all the other cats. The owner was not even aware of the dead cat,&rdquo; Meyer said.She said there were feral cats among the tamer ones and some cats had clear compatibility problems and were kept in a cage outside the house.&ldquo;The circumstances in which these animals were forced to live were unacceptable &ndash; dirty and unhygienic - and certainly not with the cats' best interest at heart,&rdquo; Meyer said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
