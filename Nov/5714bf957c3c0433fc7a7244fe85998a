We will therefore be filing papers to oppose President Zuma's application to review the remedial action required by the report," leader Mmusi Maimane said in a statement."While President Zuma is operating within the parameters of the law by taking the report on judicial review, we must remember that he has a long history of using the courts, which he has no respect for, to delay being held accountable for his acts of corruption."The Presidency made the announcement on Friday. "The President has considered and also sought legal advice on the contents of the report, as well as the remedial action to be taken," the Presidency said in a statement.Madonsela recommended that Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng set up a commission of inquiry into the matter.Maimane said it was clear that the president wants to use the courts to buy himself time while he plots his next move in order to again avoid accountability. "We will not allow him to get out of this crisis of his own making. President Zuma must be made to fund his own litigation instead of using public money for his personal benefit and political machinations," he said.Maimane added that Friday's statement coupled with comments made by Zuma in Parliament, show that Zuma has no intention of complying with the remedial action recommended."The ANC and Jacob Zuma have no interest in accountability or advancing the hopes of the people of South Africa. Their only interest is ensuring that 'Number 1' stays out of jail for his corrupt activities and that he lives in comfort while nine million people suffer without work. The DA will continue to fight corruption and work to ensure that we build a better South Africa," Maimane said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
