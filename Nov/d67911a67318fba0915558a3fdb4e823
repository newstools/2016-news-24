This is a political failure on the part of the ANC. It means finally, we can actually say with confidence that the ANC has not only failed to provide economic freedom, it has also failed to provide complete political freedom."The party tabled a motion in Parliament on Tuesday to have a resolution that all apartheid laws should be repealed. It said the purpose of the motion was to allow a process that makes sure all the legislation passed under apartheid with the intent of realising the superiority, rule and dominance of white people over black people was removed."After humiliating and factually weak inputs the ANC caucus elected to vote against this motion. The implication of this vote is that we will continue to live with apartheid laws 22 years after democracy, thus condemning our democratic dispensation to continue to live under the shadow of the murderous apartheid regime," said Ndlozi.Act used in Treason Trial - EFFThe motion received 86 votes in favour; 179 votes against and 8 abstentions.- Read more here:&nbsp;Bid to start process to repeal apartheid-era laws fails in ParliamentEFF leader Julius Malema was recently charged under the Riotous Assemblies Act of 1956 for comments he made at the party's elective conference in 2014 calling for supporters to occupy land. The case is currently being heard in the Newcastle Magistrate's Court.Ndlozi said the ANC has refused to change apartheid laws because they want to continue to use them to fight battles against political opponents."This is clearly demonstrated by their usage of the Riotous Assemblies Act of 1956, which is about protecting and advancing the dominance and supremacy of the white minority. The ANC brought charges against the CIC [commander-in-chief] Julius Malema in the Newcastle Magistrate's Court using this Act with a view to suppress him and the economic emancipation movement. This same Act was used in the Treason Trial against anti-apartheid activists who were in turn jailed for decades," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
