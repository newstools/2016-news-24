"My instructions are to withdraw the application," Zuma's lawyer Anthea Platt told a full bench of the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Gauteng Judge President Dunstan Mlambo struck off the roll Co-operative Governance Minister Des Van Rooyen's application to interdict the report for lack of urgency.The High Court also permitted opposition parties who had initially applied to oppose the president's application to join in the matter.Zuma had maintained that he did not have sufficient time to respond to questions posed by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela on his relationship with the Gupta family. Madonsela was investigating claims of undue influence by the family over Zuma.Platt told the court on Tuesday that the president had found Madonsela's report to be procedurally flawed as she did not afford him the opportunity to respond to questions and quiz witnesses before the finalisation of the report.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
