The toll included one killed in South Sinai province since Thursday, and nine in the eastern Red Sea province, a health ministry official said. The ministry reported earlier that nine people had died in Sinai but the official said that count was inaccurate. Elsewhere, six others died when their bus overturned on a flooded road in the southern province of Sohag, the ministry had said on Friday. Rains in the autumn and winter cause flooding in parts of Egypt, especially those with poor infrastructure, almost every year. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
