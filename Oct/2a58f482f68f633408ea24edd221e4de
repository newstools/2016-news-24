Valene.GovenderON 27 October, South Africans will celebrate the life of long-serving ANC president O.R. Tambo, which coincides with Red October, revolution month.Tambo was a dedicated and prominent leader who built the ANC under difficult circumstances while in exile. Today, the country is desperate for leadership of his calibre to put the ruling party in a better position to deal with the challenges that we experience in our life time.I believe he would say anniversaries cannot only celebrate the past. We must recall and acclaim our history, but more importantly, we must use the past to arm ourselves for the future, to learn lessons and to strengthen our resolve and commitment.Furthermore, the founders of the African National Congress vested in the organisation the historic responsibility of uniting the South African nation across the boundaries of colour, race and creed.My plea to our ANC component structures is that it is time to go back to basics and stop organising marches similar to the march that was led by the ANC Youth League with the aim of booting out the Minister of Finance , Pravin Gordon.I urge the ANC members, as we celebrate Tambo s life, to learn from him and work towards his wishes for a democratic South Africa for all.THABANG MASEKOANC BEC memberYure Mdyogolo24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
