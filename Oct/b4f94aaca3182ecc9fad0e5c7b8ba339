But the city remained mostly calm unlike the at last month's protests in which 49 civilians and four police were killed during violence, according to the UN.Despite the widespread strike action in Kinshasa, the situation was normal in the second city Lubumbashi.Authorities there had warned early this week that civil servants who failed to show up for work on Wednesday would face consequences.Calls for a strike were also ignored in Bukavu, according to an AFP correspondent there, as well as in northeastern Kisangani and in the country's sole deep water port, Matadi.However in Goma, eastern DRC, the call to down tools was followed to some extent, with most shops remaining closed though traffic appeared normal, according to two AFP journalists.National dialogueIn central Kananga, another big town, activity slowed in the morning while in the western town of Mbandaka people headed for work wearing yellow as a sign of protest.This week's controversial agreement to allow Kabila to serve into 2018 emerged after the EU threatened sanctions if the country did not hold elections in 2017. It was concluded at "national dialogue" talks aimed at reducing tensions triggered by disquiet that the president is seeking to remain indefinitely.But the main opposition coalition - "Rassemblement" (Gathering) - headed by veteran opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi boycotted the talks, branding them a ploy by Kabila to stay in power beyond the end of his term.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
