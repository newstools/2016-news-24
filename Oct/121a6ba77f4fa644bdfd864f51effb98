A militant attack last week on an army checkpoint left at least 12 soldiers dead and six wounded.The curfew was originally instated in late 2014 following a militant ambush that killed 31 Egyptian soldiers near the border town of Rafah.Violence in the area has spiked since el-Sissi led the military ouster of an Islamist president in 2013.Follow&nbsp;News24 Africa&nbsp;on&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;and&nbsp;Twitter.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
