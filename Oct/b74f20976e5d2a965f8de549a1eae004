Only one of the dogs had a microchip."Over 20 lost reports have been made by concerned owners whose animals have gone missing over the weekend due to fireworks."Morck said inspectors were on standby at the weekend and the emergency phone line received more than&nbsp;50 calls regarding stray animals."We are very sad to report that three animals were hit by cars, two of which are unfortunately deceased, and the third dog&rsquo;s owner was located and the dog was rushed to a vet."Morck appealed&nbsp;to residents using fireworks to be mindful of animals, including wildlife.She said the Animals Protection Act stated that "it is illegal for any person to terrify any animal".No animal cruelty reportedAny deliberate act of frightening or harming animals involving the use of fireworks may lead to prosecution under the Animals Protection Act, 71 of 1962, said Morck.The Durban and Coast SPCA said this year&rsquo;s Diwali celebration&nbsp;had been&nbsp;fairly quiet.Spokesperson Lindsey Concor said eight stray dogs and one stray cat were brought in."Unfortunately one of the dogs was dead on arrival and two dogs had to be humanely euthanised due to severe injuries. All three of these dogs are assumed to have been hit by cars. None of these eight animals has any form of identification."Concor said no cases of animal cruelty had been reported."We have noticed a decline in this inexcusable behaviour over the last four years. As with every year this time, we do expect an influx of strays over the next two weeks. We have already been contacted by a few local vets who took in several strays.&rdquo;Concor said people should not keep animals in the hopes of finding the owner."Although this is done with good intentions, we do encourage members of the public to bring in animals to their local SPCA as owners who are looking for their pets usually do call us with a lost report and we cannot match them if they animal has not been brought through," she said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
