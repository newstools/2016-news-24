WATCHCape Town - Police do not need help solving the murder of Bafana Bafana captain Senzo Meyiwa, acting national police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane told Parliament on Wednesday."The SAPS is more than capable of dealing with this matter," he told the police portfolio committee."We need no-one outside of the SAPS to investigate this case. But what we will desist from is doing, an investigation through the media."Phahlane was addressing MPs about the police's annual report, when the topic of Meyiwa's murder was raised.African National Congress MPs Leonard Ramatlakane and Angelina Molebatsi asked Phahlane about the progress of the case, the involvement of witnesses, and whether the multi-disciplinary task team set up to solve the murder required outside help.Meyiwa was shot and killed at his girlfriend&rsquo;s house in Vosloorus almost two years ago, on October 26 2014. A man entered and shot him, apparently during a scuffle.Arrest, releaseZanukuhle Mbatha, initially arrested for the murder, was released from custody in November 2015 due to a lack of evidence.Earlier this year, News24 reported that the Hawks were helping with the investigation.Phahlane, who has been acting commissioner since last October, acknowledged the high profile nature of the case, and restated that the crime scene was compromised at one stage."We then did a crime scene reconstruction, to give ourselves a chance at winning in this case, and that is on track."[But] we are not going to give information to those who are trying to escape what they are responsible for. We will find a resolution in this case."He dispelled "myths" that the case had been transferred to a station in Musina, Limpopo, and that the Hawks had taken over the investigation.The Hawks were part of the multi-disciplinary team, but the case remained within the purview of police detectives."We need the chance to allow us to make a breakthrough in the case.
