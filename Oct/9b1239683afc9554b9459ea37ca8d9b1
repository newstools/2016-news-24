The verdicts against Jean-Pierre Bemba and his legal team marked the first time the global court has found suspects guilty of attempting to pervert the course of justice.

Nor can the International Criminal Court," Presiding Judge Bertram Schmitt said after convicting the five men. "Today's judgment sends the clear message that the court is not willing to allow its proceedings to be hampered or destroyed," he added. "It sends the message that those who try to distort and interfere with the administration of justice of this court do not go unpunished." Bemba's attempts to influence his trial ultimately failed. Earlier this year he was convicted and sentenced to 18 years imprisonment for commanding a militia that went on a deadly rampage in the Central African Republic in 2002-2003. He has appealed. No date was immediately set for a sentencing hearing following Wednesday's convictions. The maximum sentence is five years in prison and a fine. Bemba's defense lawyer, Melinda Taylor, said she intends to appeal. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
