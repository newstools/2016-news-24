Preshalin Naidoo is expected to appear in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court on October 24 for the continuation of his trial. Naidoo faces two counts of culpable homicide, as a result of the crash on William Nicol Drive, Fourways, in the early hours of January 31 2015. Mhere's father Joseph survived the crash. O'Bryan had a 3-year-old daughter. In previous testimony, a witness, Mamokete Laka, said she was coming home from a church service with her mother and brother when they saw the crash in front of them. She said Naidoo kept apologising and said he had fallen asleep. She said he smelt as though he had been drinking alcohol, but she did not mention this to police at the time. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
