Sport24 weighs in. Watch. WATCHCAPE TOWN&nbsp;&mdash; Mukesh Kapila began working for the United Nations (UN) in Khartoum in 2003.As head of the UN in the then largest country on the continent, he was responsible for co-ordinating aid distribution to the country's most troubled people.But the conflict in Sudan overwhelmed Kapila's term in office. As he learned more about the violence, rape and murder of Darfur's people, he grew more and more incensed at international inaction.Hundreds of thousands of people were displaced by the conflict, which left whole settlements razed to the ground.Kapila says a wholesale genocide occurred, while his critics accused him of being party to a proxy war against the Sudan by those seeking regime change.The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued two warrants of arrest against Sudan's president Omar al-Bashir in connection with atrocities committed in Darfur.South Africa, a signatory to the ICC's Rome Statute, announced its plan to withdraw from the ICC in a year.Al-Bashir's spokesperson then encouraged other African member states to follow suit and dismiss the ICC which he deems a colonial entity.Why, asked the spokesperson, are no European or Israeli leaders tried by the court. In fact, only one case to date is not Africa (that of Georgia).With news last week that South Africa has decided to withdraw, News24's Erin Bates asks Kapila to provide insight in the conflict in Darfur.Bates asks, "What do we as South Africans need to know about Darfur and Al-Bashir?"Watch the discussion live below.&amp;lt;br _moz_dirty="" /&amp;gt;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
