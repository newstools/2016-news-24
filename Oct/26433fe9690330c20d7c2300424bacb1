Just like human beings, some live and some die. People are inclined to grab onto one thing and it as not as big an issue as it would seem," she said. &nbsp;On Monday, a whale was found beached near Richards Bay."We have lost three whales in three months in Cape Vidal and Richards Bay," a member of the public, Jaco Bates, wrote on Facebook."We found one on the beach this morning near the Caravan Park in Richards Bay. There was another that beached inside the harbour and before that there was a large female that beached near Cape Vidal," he posted.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
