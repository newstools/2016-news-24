Their new cognitive sciences centre officially opened on Tuesday in Medford, Massachusetts. The research aims to help soldiers and civilian first responders, such as firefighters. Scientists and engineers are figuring out how to measure, predict and enhance people's cognitive capabilities, so they can better solve problems and remember information in high-stakes environments. The Center for Applied Brain and Cognitive Sciences was jointly founded by the Army's Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center and the Tufts School of Engineering. The centre features an immersive virtual reality lab where an individual's or a team's neurological, psychological and behavioural responses can be monitored. Soldiers, firefighters and SWAT teams will use it. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
