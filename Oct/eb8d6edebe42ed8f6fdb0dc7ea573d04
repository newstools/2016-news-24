The pride consisted of an adult female and three sub-adult offspring, said Manclark.The new arrivals were kept in a boma for several weeks so that they could acquaint themselves with the existing pride. &nbsp;Their arrival catapulted iSimangaliso to "Big 7" status.That was followed by the arrival of two male brothers and three females during the course of 2014.More tourists"In order to slow down the breeding rate of the lions the females underwent partial hysterectomies, which are the removal of one horn of the uterus," Manclark said.Lions breed prolifically and the procedure halves the number of litters they produce, obviating the need for translocations to other parks in the short term.Since December 2013, three sets of cubs have swelled the ranks.iSimangaliso CEO Andrew Zaloumis said the lions had increased the number of tourists visiting the uMkhuze section of iSimangaliso.All iSimangaliso's adult lions are fitted with satellite tracking collars to monitor their movements for biological and safety reasons. Park staff and Wildlife Act volunteers track them daily. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
