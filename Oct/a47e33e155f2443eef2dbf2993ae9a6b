The brand is recognised internationally for their varietal specific wine glasses designed to enhance the different types of wines based on specific properties of each grape variety. Gone are the days of serving different wines throughout the evening and (gasp!) mixing reds and whites. Your at-home entertaining is about to be taken to the next level as you plan out your food and wine pairing and select the glasses to match each course. Why trust them as the authority? The family-owned and operated business was established in 1756. Now in the hands of the 10th and 11th generation of the family, Riedel has been producing glass based from Kufstein, Austria for 260 years. They received international acclaim for their innovative designs after launching the world’s first varietal-specific stemless wine tumblers (the Riedel “O” Series) in 2004. In 2008 they revealed their double-decanting technology, which aerates the wine efficiently and achieves what hours of decanting does in a matter of minutes. All Riedel glasses are dishwasher-safe, and will retain their sparkle after years of use making them a great investment and ideal wedding gift. Woolworths will be stocking Riedel decanters and a selection of glassware for a variety of different wines, including the popular “O” series. Shop it here
