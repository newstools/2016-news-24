I rejected this out of hand," Jonas said in a statement."The basis of my rejection of their offer is that it makes a mockery of our hard earned democracy, the trust of our people and no one apart from the President of the Republic appoints ministers. Let me also place it on record that there was no discussion between the Deputy Secretary General of the ANC Ms Jessie Duarte and myself on this matter."Madonsela&rsquo;s office has indicated that the report will not be released on Friday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
