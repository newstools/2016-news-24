The strong early-voting turnout by those likely to support Clinton - registered Democrats, minorities, and young people among others - could leave Donald Trump with virtually no path to the 270 electoral votes needed for victory. Clinton is showing strength in Florida and North Carolina, both must-win states for Trump, as well as the battleground states of Nevada, Colorado and Arizona. There are even favourable signs for Clinton in Republican-leaning Utah and Texas. "It's going to be a very tall order for Trump to win," said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor who specialises in election turnout. Other analysts also point to a strong finish for Clinton based on the early vote. Early voting, via mail or in-person, is underway in 37 states. More than 13.4 million votes have been cast, far higher than the rate in 2012, according to Associated Press data. In all, more than 46 million people - or as much as 40% of the electorate - are expected to vote before Election Day, on November 8. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
