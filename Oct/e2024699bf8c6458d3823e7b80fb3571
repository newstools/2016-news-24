Dore Gold has served as director general of Israel's foreign ministry since June 2015 and has been a close adviser to Netanyahu for more than two decades. The foreign ministry statement did not provide further details of why he was resigning. Netanyahu holds the post of foreign minister in addition to being prime minister. "I would like to thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for his confidence in me," the statement quoted Gold as saying. "As in the past, I will make myself available to the prime minister's needs in any capacity he sees fit." His resignation comes at a crucial time for Israeli diplomacy. Israeli leaders are concerned US President Barack Obama will seek to lay out parameters for a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict before he leaves office in January. There have also been suggestions the US president could support or at least refrain from vetoing a UN Security Council resolution on the conflict that Israel opposes. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
