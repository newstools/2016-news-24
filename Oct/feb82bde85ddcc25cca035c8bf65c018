It&rsquo;s a blatant lie that we used USAID money, ever,"&nbsp;Madonsela told Johannesburg based-radio station Power FM.Madonsela&rsquo;s successor Busisiwe Mkhwebane told Parliament&rsquo;s justice committee on Wednesday that she would stop foreign donor funding and the use of consultants. Briefing MPs on her 2015/16 annual report, she said USAID had donated $500 000 to the office.She said the office incurred R5m in irregular expenditure due to consultants.USAID said there was nothing untoward&nbsp;about&nbsp;its relationship with the Public Protector.&nbsp;The money was meant for training for investigators,&nbsp;specifically corruption and fraud detection,&nbsp;alternative dispute resolution and report writing. The intention was to increase their effectiveness.US&nbsp;embassy spokesperson Cynthia Harvey said the money was donated following discussions with Treasury and the justice department, to provide "technical assistance" to key areas of the Public Protector&rsquo;s five-year strategic plan.Earlier,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans&nbsp;Association&nbsp;said such funding brought Madonsela&rsquo;s integrity into question and threatened the Public Protector&rsquo;s independence. MKMVA chairperson Kebby Maphatsoe claimed Madonsela&nbsp;had not follow procedure in her "state capture" report. He alleged the report was completed in a hurry and was intended to tarnish President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s image and create divisions within the ANC, to suit her funders."America cannot fund you without putting their interests first.&nbsp;Thuli Madonsela must explain what were the conditions of the grants&nbsp;that she received from USAID.&nbsp;America does not fund and give grants for nothing. There are always conditions,"&nbsp;Maphatsoe said.Madonsela said no government institution received foreign funding directly. The South African government received the money and allocated it to Chapter 9 institutions like the Public Protector,&nbsp;Human Rights Commission, and Auditor-General.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
