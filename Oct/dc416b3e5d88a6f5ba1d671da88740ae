A follow-up police operation at a popular shebeen in Lotus River resulted in liquor being confiscated and a man being arrested on Friday. The premises were visited twice in one weekend during a previous operation two weeks ago. Apparently stubborn to adhere to the law, liquor was again confiscated the past weekend. Grassy Park police spokesperson Warrant Officer Wynita Kleinsmith says police and a liquor officer had an integrated operation with other law enforcement agencies and the Western Cape Liquor Authority. “Officers observed the premises, in Kers­hout Street, Lotus River, and saw that liquor was being sold [from the premises]. When entering the place, liquor [found at] the premises was confiscated. The 48-year-old suspect was arrested,” Kleinsmith says. The same evening, premises in 6th Avenue was also searched and liquor was seized there as well. A 38-year-old man was arrested. Kleinsmith confirms both suspects were arrested on charges of selling liquor without a liquor licence. An amount of 284 860F was confiscated at both premises. Two weeks ago, on Friday 30 September, police went to the same premises in Kers­hout Street and also confiscated liquor at the unlicensed shebeen. At the previous operation, more than 70 000F liquor, freezers on the premises and a undisclosed amount of cash were confiscated. The next evening, the same premises were searched and liquor to the amount of 103 590F was confiscated. A 15-year-old was arrested on charges of selling liquor without a valid liquor licence. The suspects have since appeared in court on charges of selling liquor without a licence.
