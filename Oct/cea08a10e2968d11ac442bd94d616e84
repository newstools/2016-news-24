It had only six members and required nine for a quorum.On October 5, SABC board members Krish Naidoo and Vusi Mavuso announce their resignations at a meeting with Parliament&rsquo;s communications committee.Selfe called on African National Congress chief whip Jackson Mthembu to publicly support the DA&rsquo;s court action if the party was serious about restoring the SABC&rsquo;s credibility.On September 19, the Supreme Court of Appeal rejected Motsoeneng&rsquo;s bid to appeal the Western Cape High Court&rsquo;s November 2015 ruling declaring his appointment irrational and setting it aside.Public Protector Thuli Madonsela found, in a report released in February 2014, that Motsoeneng had lied about his qualifications when he applied for the post of COO, that he hiked his salary from R1.5m to R2.4m in one year, and that he purged senior staff.Despite these adverse findings, the SABC announced on September 27 that Motsoeneng would be appointed to the corporate affairs post.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
