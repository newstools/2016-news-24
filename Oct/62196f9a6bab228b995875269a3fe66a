Avantika Seeth Turning Passion into Profit by Jabu Stone Multimedia &nbsp; &nbsp; User Galleries &nbsp; &nbsp; News in Pictures Send us your pictures &nbsp; &nbsp; Send us your stories Self-made entrepreneur Jabu Stone has just released a book titled Turning Passion Into Profit. More popularly known as the Dreadlocks King, Stone has written a biographical account of his rags-to-riches story, from his humble beginnings in the Eastern Cape to becoming one the country&rsquo;s most successful businessmen. &ldquo;I wrote this book because I wanted to encourage young entrepreneurs not to give up on their business dreams because of the challenges they might be facing, or [because of] the quest for instant rewards,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wanted them to know that I had faced greater challenges than the ones they are facing. "[So] I recounted my business journey and the challenges I had faced, and how I had overcome them.&rdquo; The Dreadlocks King has become synonymous with his own line of hair care products, which he named after himself. He founded the range in the 1990s. The former pharmacist formulated a hair care range which catered specifically for people with dreadlocks. The book, meanwhile, is the result of years of being constantly queried about his success story. &ldquo;Writing the book was a way of answering the questions people had asked me over the years,&rdquo; he said. Today his hair care range can be found in Pick n Pay and Clicks outlets across the country, and is also distributed in several other African countries. Stone&rsquo;s book is geared towards aspiring entrepreneurs, and it delves into the importance of business mentorship and overcoming obstacles. &ldquo;It was difficult to streamline what I wrote about, as there is so much that one goes through in one&rsquo;s business life. "But I have tried to concentrate on the main issues in the book,&rdquo; Stone said.&ldquo;I wanted young entrepreneurs to know about the importance of mentorship and its role in making a business a success, and [about] the mentorship programmes that are available to provide assistance.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
