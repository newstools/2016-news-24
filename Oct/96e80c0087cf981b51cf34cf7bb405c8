 @Nickymccain Shark Spotters will be launching an app, to give real-time updates of shark activity, on Thursday. The app will provide beachgoers with comprehensive information about shark safety and other beach conditions. Shark Spotters has a strong social media presence, research technician Dave van Beuningen previously told People’s Post (“Just click to follow fins”, 26 July). “However, there is a limit to the amount of information we can provide the public via our website and social media. We have identified a demand for real-time, comprehensive information regarding shark safety and other beach conditions for each of our operating beaches, so this is where the app comes in.” The app will be a one-stop resource with current shark safety and ocean conditions for Cape Town’s recreational water users and will include the current conditions at all beaches monitored by Shark Spotters. “Through the app Shark Spotters can continue to provide an extremely valuable service to Cape Town’s water users. It will be free to download, so we anticipate that it will be a very popular app,” he says. The launch will take place at the Earth Fair Food Market in Tokai at 19:30, with entertainment by comedian Rob van Vuur­en and local band The Rudimentals. Tickets are R130 at Quicket. All funds raised will go to Shark Spotters.
