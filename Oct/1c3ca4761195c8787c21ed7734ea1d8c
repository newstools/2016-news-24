That led to demonstrations against Ban in Morocco and the government's decision to expel UN civilian workers.Morocco annexed Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony, in 1975 and fought a local independence movement called the Polisario Front. The UN brokered a ceasefire in 1991 and established a peacekeeping mission known as MINURSO to monitor it and help prepare a referendum on the territory's future, which has never taken place.'Parties are not talking'&nbsp;Morocco considers the mineral-rich region its "southern provinces" and has proposed wide-ranging autonomy, but the Polisario Front insists on self-determination through a referendum for the local population.Follow&nbsp;News24 Africa&nbsp;on&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;and&nbsp;Twitter.&nbsp;The Polisario Front's foreign relations chief, Ould Salek, warned earlier this month that the group is closer to resuming confrontation with Morocco than to peace.Salek accused France, which has close ties to Morocco, of blocking Security Council action on Western Sahara and urgently appealed to council members to hold the referendum on the territory's future. He expressed hope that the United States and the other permanent council members &mdash; Russia, China and Britain &mdash; will do more than they have to ensure a referendum is held.But Uruguay's UN Ambassador Elbio Rosselli said there was "no outcome" from the closed council meeting, and expressed regret that members have been unable to agree on even simple statements on Western Sahara."The political process is at a complete stalemate," he said. "The parties are not talking."Rosselli said the secretary general's personal envoy to Western Sahara, Christopher Ross, has been unable to arrange a visit to the region. The UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said later: "A trip for Mr Ross is still under discussion."Ban will be in Morocco to attend the 22nd UN Climate Conference in Marrakesh that starts on November 7 Rosselli said he is expected to visit Rabat at that time.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
