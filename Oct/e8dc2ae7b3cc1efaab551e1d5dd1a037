Campus security extinguished it before it could spread to other vehicles or buildings.UCT was assessing smoke damage to a ventilation system that serves the department&rsquo;s laboratory and which houses highly sensitive equipment, worth millions of rand, Lucas said. A case of arson was opened.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
