The US Department of Homeland Security and the FBI said they were investigating.The disruptions come at a time of unprecedented fears about the cyber threat in the US, where hackers have breached political organisations and election agencies.Friday&rsquo;s outages were intermittent and varied by geography. Users complained they could not reach dozens of internet destinations, including Mashable, CNN, The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Yelp and some businesses hosted by amazon.com. Dyn said attacks were coming from millions of internet addresses, making it one of the largest attacks ever seen. Security experts said it was an especially potent type of distributed denial-of-service attack, or DDoS, in which attackers flood the targets with so much junk traffic that they freeze up. &ndash; sharenet.co.za 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
