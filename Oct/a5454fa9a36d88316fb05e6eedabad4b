(File ) Multimedia &nbsp; &nbsp; User Galleries &nbsp; &nbsp; News in Pictures Send us your pictures &nbsp; &nbsp; Send us your stories Beloved former Linpark High School Afrikaans teacher Barbie Burger has been scammed in an incident with echoes of the operations of the infamous &ldquo;Hospital Hustler&rdquo;.Burger (80), who became known for the kindness of her former pupils who helped pay an extraordinarily high electricity bill in November last year, fell victim to a scamster who was pretending to sell pain relief patches on Monday.Although the police are yet to confirm a link, the scamster fits the description of a woman dubbed the &ldquo;Hospital Hustler&rdquo;, who stole various items from patients at local hospitals recently.Burger said a &ldquo;tall, very dark-skinned, extremely thin&rdquo; Indian woman visited her Prestbury home this week and stole her jewellery, cellphone, handbag, glasses and blankets.The &ldquo;Hospital Hustler&rdquo; was friendly with her victims, pretended to know them and related familiar stories to them. Similarly, this scamster spoke to Burger about her shoulder injury &ldquo;as if she knew me&rdquo;.Burger, who suffers from a severe shoulder injury, said she allowed the woman into her home after being told that a neighbour had referred her to assist with her shoulder pain.&ldquo;First she told me she needed to use the bathroom as she had been travelling all day. She spent a long time in the bathroom,&rdquo; Burger said.She said the woman then asked her to fetch a dish of warm water and then sent her to fetch a towel and then a bar of soap.&ldquo;She made me go up and down to fetch things, all while she was probably stealing my things,&rdquo; Burger said.The woman arrived at her home at around 4.40 pm on Monday afternoon and spent more than two hours in Burger&rsquo;s home.&ldquo;She said she had these patches that would be placed on my back, but the patches needed gold to activate the medicine,&rdquo; she said.Burger said she produced her only gold necklace, which she bought in the early 1960s with her first salary as a teacher, to use with the &ldquo;treatment&rdquo;.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful necklace with black Onyx stones on it. I gave the necklace to her and then she told me to lie on the bed on my tummy and face the wall,&rdquo; she said.The woman pulled the blanket off her and placed it on the chair next to the bed.&ldquo;She put these patches on my back near my spine and took the necklace and rubbed it on the patches. Then she told me I had to wait for the patches to work and I must lie still and face the wall,&rdquo; she said.The patches had a sticky side to them and were stuck onto Burger&rsquo;s back. Later it was discovered the &ldquo;pain relief patches&rdquo; were in fact just cheap rubber stoppers sold at hardware stores.The woman later told Burger she had a shoulder brace that would help her and would be given to her at no extra charge.&ldquo;She said she was going to her car to fetch the brace while I lay on the bed.&rdquo;After half-an-hour, Burger eventually realised the woman had vanished and her blankets and other belongings were missing. &ldquo;After walking around the house, I noticed my bathroom cupboards were left open and my necklace was missing,&rdquo; she said.Traumatised by the incident, Burger said she immediately locked her home and called her neighbour to say she had been scammed.&ldquo;When I went to call my neighbour, I noticed my cellphone was missing, along with my handbag and reading glasses,&rdquo; she said, adding that the woman spoke &ldquo;fast and a lot&rdquo;.&ldquo;My hearing is hopeless so she probably told me her name, but I didn&rsquo;t hear. She spoke so much and so fast, like she just knew how to confuse me,&rdquo; she said.Police spokesperson Sergeant Mtokozisi Ngobese said police are investigating a case of theft.He advised people not to entertain strangers who come knocking on their doors. &ldquo;There are people out there who are targeting the vulnerable, especially the elderly. We are warning people not to open their homes to people they do not know.&rdquo;Ngobese said police would investigate and look at the merits of the case should it fit the profile of other scams.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
