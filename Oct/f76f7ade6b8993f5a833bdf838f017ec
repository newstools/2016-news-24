"The academic programme and all university activities continue tomorrow," the institution's spokesperson Shirona Patel said. Patel said no incidents of violence were reported across its campuses on Saturday. She said students from the David Webster Residence were, "singing at midnight, wanting to leave the residence but after engagement with Campus Control Officers, returned to their rooms". Nine people including two of the institution’s students will appear at Hillbrow Magistrate’s Court on Monday, she said. They were arrested following incidents of violence in Braamfontein on Friday night. "Of the nine, two were Wits students, two were from other institutions and five were not students." Patel said police would issue a statement on the arrest of Fees Must Fall leader Mcebo Dlamini later in the day. Chaos erupted at Wits University last week as clashes between protesters and police spilled over into the streets of Braamfontein in Johannesburg. Businesses were forced to close after protesters broke into shops and started looting. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
