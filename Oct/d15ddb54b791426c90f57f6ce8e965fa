The thieves stole all the foodstuffs, the gas stove, gas cylinders and fridge.They even went as far as taking the little mattresses on which the children take their naps. They took all the food like the porridge, milk and sugar, and we had nothing to feed the people with. When the children came to creche in the morning we couldn t give them their porridge as usual. It was not a nice feeling at all, said pastor David Grootboom, founder of the Grootboom Hope Foundation.He and his wife, Cynthia, had been struggling with break-ins at the soup kitchen for some time, but this was the first time they had been the target twice in one week.The soup kitchen feeds about 600 people per day, and runs on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The daycare centre cares for 30 children. It was very hard to tell the people that there is no food for them. Some of them simply don t understand. It is heartbreaking to send people away knowing they will have nothing to eat. For most people, this soup kitchen provides the only meal they will have for the day, Grootboom said.A case had been opened at the police station.The Grootboom Hope Foundation can be contacted on 078 669 6269.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
