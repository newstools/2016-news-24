This year, he's facing a dry season."Because of deforestation, the (water) source has dried up. In the 1980s, by September we had water as high as your hip," he says.Standing in his paddy now, his feet are bone dry.He's relying on the rains - already scarce in this region - to avoid going hungry.With an annual budget of just 100 ariary (about three US cents) per resident, Ranomafana does not have the capacity to defend the environment against 'tavy'.So a consortium of NGOs, in partnership with the French Development Agency (AFD), have established a pilot forest conservation project in the region.Launched in 2008, the $4.5-million plan has brought together about 20 villages to create a zone of hundreds of hectares where deforestation is strictly forbidden."Without the forest, there are so many aspects of farm life that will vanish," says Matthieu Baehrel of the non-governmental organisation EtcTerra.Changing mentalities The message to farmers is that failing to protect the forests upstream means a drop in agricultural productivity downstream."Once this concept catches on, it becomes easier to change things," says Helene Gobert, who heads up AFD's rural development and environment projects in Madagascar.The forests are also a target for villagers who use the wood to build and cook, so work is likewise focusing on showing how reforestation projects can be used to raise standards of living."Thanks to 'reforestation', we don't have to go looking in the forest for wood or building material," says resident Mamonjy as he hacks away with his machete at a grove of acacia and eucalyptus trees replanted in his village in 2012.Still, in a region the size of France where nine out of 10 people live below the poverty line, the challenges are enormous."The message has begun to sink in and we're starting to see the results... (but) we're talking about changing mentalities about things that have been practised sometimes for millenia," says Baehrel.The thing about trees, adds Gobert, is that they take a long time to grow and the positive effects are not immediately visible."We need projects that last if we're to have any hope of making a real difference," she says.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
