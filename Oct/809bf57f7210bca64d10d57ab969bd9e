The support of Deputy President Ramaphosa on this issue is based on none other than the constitutional principle of presumption of innocence until proven guilty by a competent court of law," the statement reads.Gordhan, along with former South African Revenue Service officials Oupa Magashula and Ivan Pillay, is facing a charge of fraud in connection with an early retirement package signed off by Gordhan for Pillay in 2010.Earlier the league criticised Ramaphosa for taking sides, arguing that a "leader in government should not do this".League secretary general Njabulo Nzuza told News24 that "the deputy president is succumbing to pressure that is portraying Gordhan as someone who must not be charged".The Presidency has hit back at the league saying anyone who wants to comment on the matter should &ldquo;familiarise themselves with the contents of Ramaphosa's statement before offering commentary".The statement, supported by Ramaphosa, reiterates that he remains respectful of the constitutional mandate that the NPA has to discharge without fear, favour or prejudice while balanced with the rights of all individuals, including the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a the court of law. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
