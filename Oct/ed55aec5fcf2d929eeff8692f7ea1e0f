Nor would she ask that Zuma get additional time to submit representations.&ldquo;In the circumstances, the appropriate course of action is to allow this court to decide whether or not the report should be released, or whether the president and Mr Van Rooyen should be given additional time within which to submit representations.&rdquo;She was willing to make a copy of the report available to the courts, if so directed.&ldquo;In effect, I leave the question whether the report relating to the relationship between the Gupta family and the president, or whether the president and Mr Van Rooyen should first be granted additional time within which to make representations, in the hands of the courts.&rdquo;She would not oppose any of the applications brought by the intervening parties and abide by the court&rsquo;s decision, she said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
