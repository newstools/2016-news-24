South Africa has turned its back on these ideals," he said in the court papers."It is now, together with war-torn Burundi, one of only two states party to the Rome Statute which has sought to withdraw from it."He also said that once SA withdraws from the Rome Statute, the decision cannot be easily undone, and would take a number of years to achieve."This urgency is compounded by the fact that South Africa&rsquo;s standing in the international community diminishes by the day while the notice of withdrawal remains in effect."He said Cabinet's decision had been widely condemned by the international community, and had been seen as a betrayal of its leading role in the protection of human rights.WATCH this video:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
