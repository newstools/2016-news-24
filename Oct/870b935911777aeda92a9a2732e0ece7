However, Pence wouldn't say if Trump had promised to pump even more of his own money into the Republican presidential campaign. Appearing on Fox News Sunday, Pence praised "the incredible generosity" of Trump, who has self-funded some of the campaign. Still, Trump badly trails Hillary Clinton in cash-on-hand. Pressed on whether Trump will offer more money as the November 8 election looms, Pence says only that Trump has promised the necessary resources "to drive our message". Pence also says the FBI's investigation into newly discovered emails by a Clinton aide shows she is "just a risky choice in this election". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
