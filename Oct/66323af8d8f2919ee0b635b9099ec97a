The waivers disappoint advocates who say Obama's administration hasn't made curbing the use of children in combat a higher priority. The waivers circumvent parts of the Child Soldier Prevention Act meant to block certain kinds of military assistance. Waivers also have been granted to Somalia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Rwanda, Iraq and Myanmar. The use of child soldiers is rampant in South Sudan, where civil war erupted in late 2013 and fighting continues despite a peace deal. The United Nations says around 16 000 child soldiers have been recruited. A US spokesperson says the US can use the possibility of a waiver to provide an incentive for reform. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
