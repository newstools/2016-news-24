A cargo ship on Monday accidentally tore apart a fish farm net off Assens, 200km west of Copenhagen in the western Baltic Sea. Now authorities fear the farmed trout will eat the eggs of other trout species. Soeren Knabe of the environmental group Vandpleje Fyn is urging anglers to "grab their rods and catch as many as possible. I'll join them this weekend." Knabe said on Wednesday the rip happened "at the worst time" because sea trout "are about to spawn and their eggs are 'yummy' for rainbow trout". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
