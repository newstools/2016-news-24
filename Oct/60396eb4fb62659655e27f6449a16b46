In this period it will be held by its obligations under the Rome Statute.SA is the second African country to withdraw this week, following hot on the heels of Burundi.On Wednesday President Pierre Nkurunziza confirmed that Burundi had signed legislation to make it the first country on the African continent to withdraw from the international court.
