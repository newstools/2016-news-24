All these things happened under our watch," Mthembu was quoted as saying. In the August 3rd&nbsp;local elections, the ANC lost the key metros of&nbsp;Tshwane, Johannesburg and Nelson Mandela Bay.Most recently, the NPA&rsquo;s decision to charge Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan with fraud, has seen various ANC officials speak out in support of him.Mthembu told City Press that the way in which Gordhan was being pursued went "beyond&nbsp;political bankruptcy".Mthembu said he would use the next NEC gathering to raise his concerns: "After messing up, are we fit and proper to lead the ANC?"."Speaking out against what is wrong is the only way to save the ANC, or we will continue to guillotine one another," Mthembu told the weekly newspaper.However, on Sunday, Kodwa retorted, declaring that the party "won&rsquo;t engage in public with the personal views of members of the organisation".Reacting to the article, Zodwa said that those ANC members making public comments needed to be "reminded" rather to use channels within the organisation.Otherwise, "it gives an impression that the organisation is divided".Kodwa said that the party continued to meet with "all and any" branches to &ldquo;resolve disputes&rdquo; arising since the August 3 local elections.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
