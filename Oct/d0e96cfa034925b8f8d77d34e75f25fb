The university opted to close on Tuesday and has decided to stay closed up to and including Friday as it tries to find ways of getting the academic programme back on track. "Engagements with multiple stakeholders are continuing and the ongoing planning in order to find ways to conclude the academic year successfully is far advanced. An announcement in this regard is expected soon," UCT executive head of communications Gerda Kruger said in a statement. Residences will remain open. Staff and their direct line managers are to agree on final arrangements within departments and sections. Other services available include: - Vula, the student wellness service, the disability service, the refugee rights unit, services in the Masingene Building, student financial aid services, student treasury services, the campus protection services and critical services in the Bremner Building. The Jammie Shuttle buses will not be running on both days and the library will be closed. Students on campuses around the country began protesting on September 19 after Higher Education and Training Minister Blade Nzimande announced that tertiary institutions could decide their own fee increases for 2017. They had to be capped at 8% and poor students and those from households that make less than R600 000 a year would not be affected by the increase. But students have raised other demands apart from free education, including decolonised higher education. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
