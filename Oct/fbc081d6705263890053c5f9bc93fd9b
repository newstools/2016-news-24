– An investigation has found that a surgeon at a Massachusetts hospital removed
a kidney from the wrong patient after failing to confirm the patient's
identity. State and
federal health investigators say the surgeon in July was supposed to remove a
kidney with a tumour from a patient at St Vincent Hospital in Worcester, but
instead removed a healthy kidney from a different patient with the same name. Authorities
say the hospital failed to follow proper patient identification protocols by
checking birth dates. The patients were several years apart in age. St
Vincent has been put on notice that its Medicare and Medicaid agreements with
the government will be terminated unless it takes corrective action. The
hospital in a statement said it is taking "all necessary steps" to
prevent a similar error. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
