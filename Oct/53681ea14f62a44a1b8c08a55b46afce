Abrahams is considering the matter," NPA spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku told News24.City Press reported that informal discussions were underway between Abrahams, his close allies in the NPA, as well as lawyers for Gordhan and his two co-accused to drop the charges against them.City Press reported that a draft letter had been compiled by Abrahams' office, communicating his intention to drop the fraud charges against Gordhan."You can't be writing letter were you are considering to drop charges. The assertion that he is meeting with [Gordhan's] lawyers is rubbish. The director takes decisions to prosecute independently. He doesn't confer with outsiders," Mfaku added.Gordhan, former Sars commissioner Oupa Magashula and former deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay are due to appear in the Pretoria Regional Court on November 2 on charges of fraud.They relate to Gordhan and Magashula having approved early retirement for Pillay in 2010. Pillay was later rehired on a contract basis.Thousands of Gordhan supporters, including opposition party leaders and ANC stalwarts, are expected to march to the court on Wednesday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
