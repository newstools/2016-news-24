The separatist Donetsk News Agency said on Sunday that Arsen Pavlov, also known as Motorola, was killed in Donetsk when a bomb exploded in an elevator in an apartment building where he was staying. He is one of several prominent warlords who have been killed in bombings in the past year which Ukraine watchers attribute to infighting among the separatists. Pavlov once admitted killing 15 prisoners of war. The conflict between separatists and Ukrainian government forces has been raging since April 2014, killing more than 9 600 people. Russian-born Pavlov, 33, worked in a car wash before he crossed the border and joined the separatists in 2014. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
