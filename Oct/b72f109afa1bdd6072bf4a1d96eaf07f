They are spending your funds."The irregular expenditure figure rose from R431m in the previous financial year. R68m in fruitless expenditureIrregular expenditure is defined as expenditure incurred in contravention of key legislation and where goods are delivered, but prescribed processes are not followed.The department also registered R68m as fruitless and wasteful expenditure, defined as expenditure incurred in vain and which could have been avoided if reasonable steps had been taken.The representative said the Auditor General would like to see the functioning of these external implementing agencies addressed.There was a slight improvement in the&nbsp;quality of the department's financial reporting this year, he continued. It obtained a clean audit, but with some areas of concern.It&nbsp;needed to improve its communication, key controls, and bring stability&nbsp;to top management positions to address some of the audit findings.The department was due to present before the committee after lunch on Tuesday, but its presentation has been moved to Thursday, as the minister and deputy minister were not available.&nbsp;ANC MP Hlomane Chauke promised that the debate with the department would be "robust". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
