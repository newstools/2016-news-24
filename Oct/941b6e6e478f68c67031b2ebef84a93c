Whether people love it or not, it's the reality.&rdquo;Zuma said people who claimed he put his party above the country and the Constitution had forgotten the contribution made by ANC members.He praised Tambo, who he said helped deepen the love and respect many had for South Africa."That's why many of us were prepared to die," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
