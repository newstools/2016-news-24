Referring to her as a "national drama queen with low self-esteem", national spokesperson Mlondi Mkhize said they would be using the Access to Information Act to force the newly-appointed Public Protector to immediately make details available of the telephone calls made by Madonsela. They accused Madonsela of trying to topple President Jacob Zuma. They also called for Madonsela to honour Zuma’s request to interrogate some of the witnesses who gave evidence in the state capture probe. Madonsela suffered from low self-esteem, the youth league said. "Her confidence is only boosted when she sees herself vandalising the name of the president on TV and in various media platforms," Mkhize said. They accused her of wasting taxpayers' money and leaking information to the media regarding her interactions with Zuma. They were disgusted with her overzealousness, the ANCYL said. "Her term of office has been characterised by efforts aimed at manipulating the media using the president as a tool. Unsuspecting journalists and media houses have elevated her into a national drama queen, a status which will come to an end on October 15, 2016." Her behaviour could not go unchallenged, they said. "The ANCYL cannot wait for October 15 2016, bang or no bang." WATCH this video:  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
