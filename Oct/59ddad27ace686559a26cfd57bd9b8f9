She, however, did not name names.&nbsp;But Buhari said that having run for president three times and having succeeded at the fourth attempt, he could "claim superior knowledge over her and the rest of the opposition because at the end I have succeeded" in winning Nigeria&rsquo;s presidency.&nbsp;"It is not easy to satisfy the whole Nigerian opposition parties and participate in the government," Buhari was quoted as saying.&nbsp;Following Buhari&rsquo;s remarks, many in Nigeria took to social media, with some wondering what Buhari meant by "the other room". The hashtag #TheOtherRoom started trending in the west Africa country. #TheOtherRoom pic.twitter.com/ASjld82n2FWe need to take a damn hard look inwards as a nation for allowing this savage and sociopath be our President #TheOtherRoom&mdash; ????
