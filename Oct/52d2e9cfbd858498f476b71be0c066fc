He spoke after a visit to Maiduguri, the city that is the birthplace of Boko Haram and the home of the Nigerian army's Giwa Barracks.The Associated Press has documented the deaths of thousands of detainees at the barracks in recent years. Amnesty International has said 8 000 detainees died there between 2011 and 2015. This year, Amnesty called for the detention centre's closure, saying babies and children are among the many detainees dying from disease, hunger, dehydration and untreated gunshot wounds.The London-based human rights group also says President Muhammadu Buhari has failed to fulfill election promises in 2015 to halt abuse of civilians by Nigerian security forcesMinistry of Defense spokesperson Brigadier General Rabe Abubakar has called Amnesty's charges "a distraction", insisting that "our duty is to protect lives, and that is what we have been doing".Boko Haram's insurgency has killed more than 20 000 people and forced 2.6 million from their homes in less than a decade.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
