I went back to the kitchen and put kettle on. I heard a desperate scream. I ran back and saw him a couple of meters from the edge and I ran downstairs," she said.Murphy then jumped into the canal in an effort to save the floundering bather."As I jumped in he went under the water. I looked for him for about 20 minutes and then realised that it was futile. The water was so murky, so I got out," she said."A group of guys in a car stopped looking for a man and he was obviously their friend. They had been at Cape2Cairo [nightclub] and their friend had disappeared," Murphy added.Police are investigating. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
