We have to allocate meetings off site," Zuma responded.Departments currently looking at the proposal as part of the presidential task team include the departments of transport, labour, public works and the South African Police Service."National Treasury is looking at the budgetary implications. The department of justice is focusing on the legislative requirements," he continued."The departments of public service and administration is looking into admin and human capital implications."Also being looked at are the needs of Parliament and space requirements for residential accommodation for MPs and office bearers."He said the decision on the move was ultimately for Parliament to make, but that Cabinet would try to persuade the two Houses of the wasteful expenditure in keeping Parliament in Cape Town.House chairperson Thandi Modise said herself and Speaker of Parliament Baleka Mbete support the suggestion of moving Parliament, but are yet to receive the presidential task team's report.They will consider the report once it is delivered to Parliament. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
