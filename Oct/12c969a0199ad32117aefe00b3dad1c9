Obiang has been summoned to appear on October 24 at a Paris court.Among Obiang's alleged purchases are the famous white glove of pop star Michael Jackson's, private jets and sprawling properties.Diplomatic immunity&nbsp;In 2012 French prosecutors ordered the seizure of the Obiang family's six-storey mansion on Avenue Foch - one of the poshest addresses in Paris - as well as several luxury cars and vintage wines.But the African nation has already filed a case before the ICJ in The Hague in June, maintaining that Obiang has diplomatic immunity.It has now argued that Obiang's case cannot proceed in French courts until the ICJ has ruled on whether France breached his right to immunity.And last week it filed an urgent request for the ICJ to order a suspension of the French legal proceedings.Obiang's father, President Teodoro Obiang Nguema, who has ruled the country with an iron fist since 1979, is Africa's longest-serving leader, and extended his 36-year rule in April when he was re-elected with 93.7% of the vote.In its main filing, the Equatorial Guinea has urged the ICJ to "declare that the French Republic has breached its obligation to respect the principles of the sovereign equality of states".The ICJ has given both Equatorial Guinea and France until next year to file its responses to the court.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
