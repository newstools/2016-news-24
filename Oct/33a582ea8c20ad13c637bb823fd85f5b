Unfortunately, they have run away even before the forces reached the town," said Cabdirisak Mohamed, a security official in the capital Bossaso, about 70km west of Qandala.Mohamed dismissed the takeover of Qandala as "a desperate attempt to draw attention."The militants - led by former Shabaab cleric Abdiqadir Mumin - switched allegiance from al-Qaeda to ISIS a year ago but have done little since apart from issuing occasional promotional videos.Nevertheless, in late August the US State Department named Mumin a "global terrorist" making him a potential target for US drone strikes which are regularly carried out against jihadists in Somalia.Abdukadir Said, a trader from Qandala said aircraft flying over the town may have spooked the militants. "There were aircraft hovering over Qandala during the last six hours" before they left, he said. Once a pirate stronghold, Qandala is an ancient trading and fishing town whose main significance is its proximity to Yemen, across the Gulf of Aden, where al-Qaeda and ISIS groups both operate. In the past the Shabaab has been resupplied with weapons and fighters sent from Yemen.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
