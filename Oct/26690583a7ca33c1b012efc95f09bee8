He failed to do this, despite being given a week&rsquo;s notice.&rdquo; &nbsp;The organisation said the charges were &ldquo;obviously without foundation... &ldquo;Relating to the early retirement and subsequent re-employment of Ivan Pillay, a former Deputy Commissioner of SARS, they are completely invalid, both legally and on any plausible reading of the facts.&rdquo; Instead, the organisations suggested on Sunday, the decision to charge revealed a &ldquo;dizzying incompetence&rdquo; at the NPA and Hawks.The organisations said their application was not aimed to protect particular individuals or take sides in &ldquo;factional battles&hellip;&ldquo;It is about protecting the machinery of the state from being undermined for malign purposes, thereby also preventing further damage to our fragile economy at a sensitive time.&rdquo;The National Prosecuting Authority head Shaun Ahrahams announced last week on Tuesday that Gordhan, former deputy SARS commissioner Ivan Pillay and former SARS commissioner Oupa Magashula, would be charged with fraud relating to Pillay&rsquo;s early retirement and the extension of his contract.They are due to appear in the Pretoria Regional Court on November 2.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
