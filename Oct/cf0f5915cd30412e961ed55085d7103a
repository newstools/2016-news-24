Tladi.MoloiThe South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) in the Fezile Dabi Region wishes the matric class of 2016 good luck in the final examinations. The organisation has urged every learner to aim to pass, but also to achieve a quality pass. Sanco believes that a good mark opens doors for better tertiary education, which will lead to employability, access to bursaries and an end to poverty. During the examinations, many learners and families are filled with anxiety over whether learners will pass this crucial test that is practically a gate to changing their lives for the better, said Sanco. The organisation has asked parents and guardians of these matriculants to ensure that the emotional wellness and health of these learners is kept at a level that affords them maximum concentration and focus on their studies. Sanco s message to the learners is for the matrics to stay calm and focused. Z Edgar Legoale, acting regional secretary of Sanco24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
