A team of Hawks and SAPS officers approached the house in Site B when they came under fire, Captain Lloyd Ramovha said. The officers retaliated and managed to get inside the house to arrest the men with alleged gang links. No one was injured. Ramovha said an automatic rifle, two handguns with the serial numbers filed off, and ammunition was seized. “The seized firearms are in the process of being subjected to ballistic tests to determine if they were used in the commission of other crimes,” he said. The trio, aged 27, 28 and 30, were charged with possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. They would appear in court next week. A man with “alleged intrinsic links” to the trio appeared in Khayelitsha Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. The Hawks’ narcotic and firearms unit swooped on Anele Mayongo, 23, at a petrol station in Lingelethu West on Tuesday. He appeared for possession of an unlicensed firearm. The matter was postponed until next week for bail information. Provincial acting Hawks head, Brigadier Mzwandile Ndlovu, welcomed the arrests. “This augurs well for the fight against proliferation of firearms in our communities. We shall continue to execute our constitutional mandate to ensure the safety of all members of the community at all material times.”   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
