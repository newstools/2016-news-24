This would allow the rest of the 2016 academic year to be salvaged, the NWC believed.Duarte said they asked the task team to meet vice chancellors to discuss these issues.The NWC wanted the task team to review Nzimande&rsquo;s R600 000 income threshold and make it more &ldquo;scientific and realistic&rdquo;. Nzimande announced on September 19 that students from households with an annual income of up to R600 000 would not have to pay fee increases for 2017, for fee increments up to 8%.Duarte said Nzimande&rsquo;s proposal was an interim measure to deal with the "intense aggression" at universities. It however failed to take into account the "black tax" &ndash; the money black income earners had to use to support their needy relatives.While the NWC stood by recent comments that it had gone beyond the goals for higher education set down in the Freedom Charter, it recognised that the National Student Financial Aid Scheme had become &ldquo;a difficulty&rdquo; for students.The ANC gave no clear deadline on delivering free education. Duarte said they must "progressively increase access to free and quality education for the poor and working class".She said students&rsquo; concerns were legitimate, but urged them to distance themselves from the violence at some institutions. &nbsp;&ldquo;We must save this academic year, all students must go back to school, students must write their exams. We must not waste this year."&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
