The attackers came in eight vehicles," said the leader, who asked to remain anonymous fearing reprisal from the military."The soldiers suffered huge casualties because they were taken off-guard. They never anticipated such an attack," he said, adding that the jihadists stole six military vehicles and weapons.Boko Haram has been waging a seven-year uprising against the Nigerian state, claiming more than 20 000 lives with the insurgency spilling over the west African nation's borders into neighbouring states.ISWAP is a faction of Boko Haram, whose leader Abu Musab al-Barnawi was appointed by the Islamic State jihadist group in August.Boko Haram's longtime chief Abubakar Shekau still claims he is in charge, however, as rival factions vie for control.Many Chibok girls still held&nbsp;News of the raid came less than a week after 21 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram from the northeast Nigerian town of Chibok in 2014 were released.Even as town residents celebrated the girls' return, experts warned the nation must brace for more violence as the government negotiates for the others.The remaining 197 girls appear to be spread out in different jihadist camps, though Shekau has claimed in the past that several died in Nigerian air strikes.Nigerian presidency spokesperson Garba Shehu has said that the ISWAP faction of Boko Haram has claimed to have "83 or more girls to release on negotiation.""Whenever the Nigerian government will be negotiating with one faction, the other one will be calling for attention," Martin Ewi, a researcher at the Pretoria-based Institute for Security Studies, told AFP. "You will be hearing about negotiations and you'll be hearing about attacks."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
