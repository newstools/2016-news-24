Thulani Gqirana, News24Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan (Netwerk24) Multimedia &nbsp; &nbsp; User Galleries &nbsp; &nbsp; News in Pictures Send us your pictures &nbsp; &nbsp; Send us your stories Cape Town &ndash; The African National Congress has welcomed NPA head Shaun Abrahams&rsquo; decision to drop the fraud charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, as well as Ivan Pillay and Oupa Magashula."The ANC always believed in the innocence of Comrade Pravin Gordhan, hence our unwavering support since fraud charges were preferred against him. Actions of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to charge Comrade Pravin Gordhan and others, have had a negative impact on the economy and created unnecessary speculations about the real motive," spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said.He called on the appointing authority to engage the NPA leadership to avoid a repeat of this and to protect the independence and integrity of the NPA."Now that the charges have been dropped, we must continue to build on the trajectory of economic growth as envisaged and to create jobs as outlined by the Minister of Finance, Comrade Pravin Gordhan, in the recent Medium Term Budget Policy Statement."Meanwhile, Congress of the People spokesperson Dennis Bloem said they were not surprised by the decision to withdraw the charges.Huge embarrassment"From the onset, there has been no case against the three. COPE is more than ever convinced that these were politically motivated cases. This is a very good example of a person who&rsquo;s being remote-controlled, doing things because you are told to, not because you want to."The debacle was a huge embarrassment for Abrahams, Cope said."We must say to Abrahams that this decision is not out of goodwill. He certainly lacks integrity. This is as a result of the resilience and pressure from the people. It is definitely a victory for the people of this country and a big blow for the state capture vultures."Bloem called for Abrahams to resign immediately, as he had brought the NPA into disrepute.The DA also welcomed the dropping of the charges against Gordhan."Today&rsquo;s decision by Adv. Shaun Abrahams, to drop criminal charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan vindicates the DA&rsquo;s position that these charges were indeed manufactured for malicious political purposes, and were without merit from their inception," party leader Mmusi Maimane said in a statement.Freedom Front Plus leader Pieter Mulder called for Abrahams to resign to restore the credibility of the institution.The withdrawing of the charges proved that the decision to summon the three was not well thought out, Mulder said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
