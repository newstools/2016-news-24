For example, marine biology depends on complex mathematical models currently being developed by oceanographers."The team leaders issued a call last year for research proposals, receiving over 100 ideas. A panel of experts whittled these down to 22.Adopted projects include mapping whales, penguins and albatrosses in the Southern Ocean; measuring the effect of plastic pollution on the food chain; and logging the extent of phytoplankton - the base of the food chain - and its role in regulating climate.Scientists will also take ice core samples and study biodiversity on the continent in an attempt to reveal conditions before the onset of the Industrial Revolution.ACE is the first project of the newly-created Swiss Polar Institute (SPI) - a joint venture of various Swiss research and educational institutions that aims to "enhance international relations and collaboration between countries, as well as to spark the interest of a new generation of young scientists in polar research."The journey will be divided into three legs, with Hobart in Australia and Punta Arenas in Chile serving as staging posts.Other stop-offs include the Crozet Islands, South Sandwich, South Georgia and the Mertz iceshelf on Antarctica itself.Frederik Paulsen, a founder of the SPI, David Walton, the expedition's science coordinator, other contributing scientists and politicians were due to gather in London on Monday for the official launch.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
