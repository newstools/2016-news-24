First, we repeatedly asked the NPA to afford the minister an opportunity to make representations to them before they decided whether to prosecute the minister, but they spurned our requests."&nbsp;Abrahams told Parliament's justice committee on Friday that he was willing to review the decision to prosecute Gordhan if approached to do so. The NPA has given Gordhan a deadline of 17:00 on Tuesday. This is a developing story. More to follow. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
