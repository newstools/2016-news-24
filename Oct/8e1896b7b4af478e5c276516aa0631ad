The collapse happened on Saturday night at an apartment in a recently constructed building, the Angers prefecture said. One of the injured is in serious condition. The victims were three men and a woman aged 18 to 25, according to the Angers' prosecutor, Yves Gambert. Seven people remained hospitalised on Sunday afternoon, he added. About 30 people had gathered in the apartment for a housewarming party when the balcony "suddenly collapsed", he said. An investigation has been opened to establish the cause of the collapse.
