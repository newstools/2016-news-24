These included decisions to refuse foreign donor funding, the naming of investigation reports and some of her priorities in the job."It's up to the court to decide if that report [on state capture] is finalised or not ready for publication or which direction that report must take," she told journalists.President Jacob Zuma and Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des Van Rooyen have applied for an interdict to prevent the report's release.Mkhwebane, who has never seen the report, said it was under lock and key in a safe in the office of the head of legal services.Although she said she wouldn't receive the finalised report and rework it, there might be a need to do so if one of the complainants asks for more information."Unless there is a complaint from the applicant to say I need additional things to be added. Then we can look at the report."In an attempt to further clarify the position the office finds itself in, her deputy Kevin Malunga said these were uncharted waters.Mkhwebane said she had not yet seen the report. It was delivered to her office in a sealed envelope. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
