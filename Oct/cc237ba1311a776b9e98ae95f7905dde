Police committee chairperson Francois Beukman said on Tuesday that because the National Assembly had not made a decision about the matter, it would be dropped.McBride returned to his job on Wednesday, after having been suspended for 16 months. The Constitutional Court ruled on September 6 that Nhleko did not have the legal power to suspend him.It declared the suspension invalid and set it aside. It however suspended the declaration of invalidity for 30 days for Parliament to decide if it wanted to take disciplinary action against McBride.Nhleko lambasted Parliament for failing to deal with the matter on time.Parliament said Nhleko needed to refrain from making unprecedented, unwarranted and unfortunate attacks. It said he had cast aspersions on parliamentary processes.The ANC said Parliament&rsquo;s function was not to rubber-stamp executive members&rsquo; feelings and decisions. The executive was accountable to Parliament and its rules and processes.&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t just attack another arm of the state, particularly Parliament,&rdquo; said Kodwa.&ldquo;We call on him to retract and withdraw his statement attacking the integrity of another arm of the state, the legislature, and especially the Speaker.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
