They [the charges] were politically motivated and have no basis in law.&rdquo;They said that if charges were dropped the assembly would signify a victory rally.&ldquo;We are in discussion with all the formations that have already committed to the People&rsquo;s Assembly, encouraging them to stay with us and to commemorate this achievement. These include civil society organisations, the major political parties, political stalwarts, organised labour, Business Unity (BUSA) and the CEO Initiative, and professionals.&rdquo; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
