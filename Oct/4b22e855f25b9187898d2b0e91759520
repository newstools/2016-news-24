Tanya Jacobs said the typical Midlands weather last month &mdash; &ldquo;misty, rainy and cold&rdquo; &mdash; shrunk her fingers to a point where her 18-carat white gold wedding ring slipped off her finger without her even noticing. &ldquo;We were sussing out a few spots to do pictures on the lawns of Michaelhouse school. As we were walking back to the chapel I noticed my ring was gone,&rdquo; Jacobs said. But, being a professional photographer, Jacobs said she could not let the loss of her ring distract her from doing her job.She said she immediately thought it was gone for good but also hoped one of the Michaelhouse pupils would find it. &ldquo;I just thought to myself that it was definitely lost. &ldquo;The lawns at Michaelhouse are extensive and there was no way my little ring would be found,&rdquo; she said. She said she had a glimmer of hope thinking that perhaps one of the Michaelhouse boys, being taught &ldquo;good morals&rdquo;, would pick up her ring and return it to her. But her assistant and sister, Natalie dos Santos, promised she would find her ring before they left the wedding venue. &ldquo;She left the wedding ceremony and retraced our steps. She went looking through all the luscious lawn and found it,&rdquo; Jacobs said. Despite this being a painstaking process, Dos Santos eventually ran in &ldquo;excitedly&rdquo; with the ring while Jacobs was at the top of the chapel photographing the bridal couple. &ldquo;She was so excited and so was I. It was shocking that she had found this little ring in all that lawn. I was ecstatic,&rdquo; Jacobs said of the happy find. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
