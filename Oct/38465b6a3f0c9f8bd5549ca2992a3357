A police officer said Sunday's attack took place in Baghdad's Shi’ite-dominated Jadriyah neighbourhood on the Tigris River, where the explosive-laden bomber approached Shi’ites commemorating the seventh century death of Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad. A medical official confirmed the toll. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to release information to the press. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement carried by the ISIS-linked Aamaq news agency. The claim could not be independently verified. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
