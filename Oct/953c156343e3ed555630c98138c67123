Kuzwayo&rsquo;s family announced her death on Sunday in a terse statement.One in Nine said that Khwezi had refused to be silenced.&ldquo;Just over 10 years ago Fezeka, known to the media as Khwezi, was raped by Jacob Zuma. She refused to be silent.&ldquo;She opened a rape case against him, which, eventually, was more about putting her on trial than him. He was acquitted on 8 May 2006 and Fezeka and her mother lost their home and were forced into exile.&rdquo; &nbsp;&ldquo;Despite the characterisation in the mainstream corporate media and in court, Fezeka to us was a feminist, an activist, a teacher, a sister, a friend, a colleague who inspired people close to her and women who only knew her Khwezi. She reminded us and will continue to remind us to always speak truth to power,&rdquo; the statement read.&ldquo;To Fezeka&rsquo;s mom and those that have continued to support her over the years, we extend our love and deepest sympathies. We continue to believe her and we will continue to fight for justice for Fezeka and all survivors.&rdquo;In August Zuma was delivering a speech at an IEC event when his message was disrupted by three women who held pieces of cardboard with the words &ldquo;Khanga&rdquo;, &ldquo;Remember Khwezi&rdquo;, &ldquo;10 yrs later&rdquo; and &ldquo;I am 1 in 3&rdquo;. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
