IT S easier than ever to pay your Kouga municipal accounts. Gone are the days when irate residents had to queue at the end of a month now the options are endless, and at the tip of your fingers.Kouga Executive Mayor Elza van Lingen gave this assurance to residents and businesses after concerns were raised that municipal cashiers operated at awkward times for those who are at work or out of town during the week. Now residents can make use of various options to pay their municipal accounts, some of which are at their doorstep or at the tip of their fingers. Although some still regard paying their accounts at the municipal pay-point as more reassuring, we have reliable and reputable partners right across the country where residents can make their payments, says van Lingen. The Mayor adds that only those outlets listed on the account issued by the municipality should be used, and residents should ensure that they are issued a receipt when making payments. These outlets are the Post Office, pay@, Ackermans, Shoprite/Checkers/Usave, Spar, Pick n Pay, PEP Stores, EasyPay, My eBills and Boxer. One can also visit the Income Section at the municipal offices and arrange for a debit order to be made by the municipality. Residents can make use of Electronic Fund Transfers (EFT), with the payer s municipal account numbers as reference. This option is one of the most convenient as it can be done from the comfort of one s home or workplace.
