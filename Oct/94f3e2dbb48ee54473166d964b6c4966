Extra carriages had been added to accommodate the additional passengers."Searches at the site of the accident wound up on Sunday," a Camrail railway official who asked not to be identified told AFP. On Saturday a Camrail official said the toll had hit at least 60.Cameroon was observing a day of national mourning Monday, with flags flying at half mast and church services planned across the country.President Paul Biya, who returned home on Sunday after a month out of the country, said he had called for an inquiry into the accident. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
