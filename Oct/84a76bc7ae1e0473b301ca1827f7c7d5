The State Department said on Wednesday it had "redirected" $108m of $150m in unspent 2015 economic support funds from Egypt because of "process delays that have impeded the effective implementation of several programmes". It said the money had been transferred "to other priorities and needs" without specifying what those were. The shift occurred earlier this year and did not involve security assistance. It was first reported by the Al-Monitor website. A number of lawmakers had called for some of the Egypt money to go to Tunisia due to Egyptian delays on education and health programs. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
