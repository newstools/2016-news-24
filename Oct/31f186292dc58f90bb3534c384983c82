He is taking public money to defend himself in court for wrongly taking public money for Nkandla," commented Motau.Zuma had to pay back R7.8m of the R249m it cost to upgrade his private estate in Nkandla, KwaZulu-Natal.This was after initially deciding that he did not have to heed former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's recommendation that the cost of a swimming pool, cattle kraal and amphitheatre come out of his own pocket.An attempt at passing the swimming pool off as a "fire pool" was even made by the Minister of Police Nathi Nhleko at one point.The issue caused a political furore when Parliament also decided that the protector's report had no legal standing, leading to a severe dressing down by the Constitutional Court after this view was challenged by the DA and the Economic Freedom Fighters. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
