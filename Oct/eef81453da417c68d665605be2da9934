I realised it had been hidden,&rdquo; the scientist said during a hearing into his conduct at the Health Professions Council of SA (HPCSA).After the &ldquo;scales fell from his eyes&rdquo; when he read The New Atkins for a New You, Noakes said he immersed himself into studying it and became a leading expert in LCHF in the country.&ldquo;I have an obsessive compulsive nature to find answers,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I am highly critical of myself and judge myself against top in the world. I look for information. I want to be the world&rsquo;s best LCHF expert.&rdquo;Noakes &ndash; whose book The Real Meal Revolution promotes the LCHF diet &ndash; was called before the council after the former president of the Association for Dietetics in South Africa, Claire Julsing-Strydom, lodged a complaint against him.The complaint was prompted by a tweet Noakes sent to a Pippa Leenstra after she asked him for advice on feeding babies and on breastfeeding.Her tweet read: "@ProfTimNoakes @SalCreed is LCHF eating ok for breastfeeding mums? Worried about all the dairy + cauliflower = wind for babies?? [sic]"Noakes advised her to wean her child onto LCHF foods, which he described as "real" foods.His tweet read: "Baby doesn't eat the dairy and cauliflower. Just very healthy high-fat breast milk. Key is to ween [sic] baby onto LCHF."Noakes, an A1 rated scientist, argued during the hearing that his advice was anything but unconventional. He quoted research from as far back as the 1800s, before the boom in obesity rates.&ldquo;I am one of the leading people that can talk about LCHF at any age. What applies to adults, applies to babies, except babies need a higher fat diet to build their brains,&rdquo; he said.He said he was trying to raise money to fund research to prove that an LCHF diet could reverse diabetes.Earlier, he argued that he had presented enough evidence during the hearing to prove that a LCHF diet was scientific. He said he found the process cathartic.The hearing continues on Thursday.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
