WSAR was conducting a field deployment exercise at the reserve in Somerset West when they were alerted to a man who was unresponsive, said spokesperson Johann Marais. The visitor, in his 70s, had used time off from work commitments to hike with a group of 14, he said. They were apparently on the Woodies Walk trail, a five-hour moderate but tiring hike with moderate climbing. His identity was not immediately available. The rescue team transported a paramedic in a 4x4 vehicle to a point around 700m away from the man. The paramedic arrived within 40 minutes after the first call for help. A Skymed helicopter hoisted the man out to a temporary base close to the reserve entrance. Marais said the man did not survive and his body was handed over to the police’s forensic department. It was not clear how he died. He extended condolences to the man’s family and friends. "The [field deployment] exercise was called off after we had a full debrief on the lessons learnt." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
