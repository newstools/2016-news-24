"One group of 18 male elephants is regularly seen swimming its way from an island in the Zambezi to Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park," the group says.It's already well-known that elephants from Botswana tramp their way across the (dry) border in Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park, more than 200km from the Victoria Falls area.At the height of the dry season, elephants are attracted to the artificial watering pans in Hwange that groups like the Bhejane Trust take such efforts to keep running.&nbsp;Sadly, this is also when cyanide poachers have in the past been waiting to strike: four more elephants were discovered poisoned near a water hole in Hwange, Zimbabwe's official Herald newspaper reported on Monday. The latest deaths add to eight suspected to have been poisoned last month in and near the national park.Trevor Lane of the Bhejane Trust says in a newsletter released this week that it is to the credit of Zimbabwe's wildlife authority that the cyanide poisoning problem has not killed more elephants so far this year though "without doubt it will happen again."&nbsp;The worst toll for cyanide poisonings was in 2013, when up to 200 Hwange elephants were killed this way for their tusks.Elephants in this huge park tend to head across the border for Botswana en masse when the rains come. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
