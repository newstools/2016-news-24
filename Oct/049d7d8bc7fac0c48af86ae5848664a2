The walk, which is held on what would have been Gandhi&rsquo;s birthday, commenced at 2 pm in the city&rsquo;s Freedom Square, and headed for Pietermaritzburg train station about four kilometres away.A short distance from the starting point, the procession made its first stop at and thronged the Mahatma Gandhi statue, where school pupils were educated about the man.Magubane said the younger generation should be taught history and the people who made it.&ldquo;It is important to teach our children about our fallen leaders. In schools we were taught about a few of them and others were omitted. &ldquo;Gandhi was a very peaceful man. He fought in a peaceful manner. That is something which is relevant for our young people to learn about him,&rdquo; said Magubane.Speaking to The Witness about the recent unrest at South African universities, Magubane said students had the right to protest, but they should do it in a peaceful manner and not resort to damaging property.Pietermaritzburg Gandhi Memorial Committee chairperson Aroo Naidoo said the walks were intended to perpetuate the legacy and teachings of Gandhi.&ldquo;His non-violent way of handling issues emerged in Pietermaritzburg when he was thrown out of the train on June 6, 1893 for refusing to change from a first-class compartment to a third-class because he was not white.&ldquo;We learn so many significant lessons from Gandhi&rsquo;s teachings even today,&rdquo; he added.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
