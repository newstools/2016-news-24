According to reports, 57 came from Durban.It was believed that many of them broke ranks from the ANC after the controversial provincial conference which took place in Pietermaritzburg last year which saw Sihle Zikalala become the party's provincial chairperson and another conference which followed later which saw Zandile Gumede elected as the regional chairperson.Former provincial chairperson Senzo Mchunu, who was the premier, was subsequently axed.Several people were also killed in what was believed to be politically-motivated killings ahead of the elections.Mthembu said if there are admissions that something went wrong in the list processes, the errors should be corrected.National team to deal with issuesFor example, he said, there would be by-elections in Umhlathuzi where there were challenges."Candidates stood in a ward only to find that it was the wrong ward hence the ANC said we need to start afresh. The candidates will go and stand in the correct wards, we expect that where it is established that a candidate was imposed, rather than risking public protests over a period of time, let's rather correct the situation because we don't want to sit with tensions and conflict.""We cannot afford a divided alliance and individual partners,"&nbsp;Mthembu said.ANC provincial secretary Super Zuma said the party's national teams would work with the already existing provincial teams to look at the issues that were raised by branches that could not be attended to before the elections.He said the national team would deal with specific wards in the province."It is not like the teams formed for the Nkosazana [Dlamini-Zuma] commission which looked at all the issues. This team will look at specific wards where we need to go back and correct things."Court actionSome of the issues raised by branches were concerns of processes leading up to the provincial conference, candidate selection processes, gatekeeping."There are areas where we are saying moving forward to the national policy conference, as KwaZulu-Natal, we need to make some submissions that will talk to how we can strength our guidelines so that they can be better interpreted, other things may need constitutional review."When asked if the alliance had discussed the court action taken by some members, believed to be in former premier Senzo Mchunu's faction, who challenged the outcomes of last year's provincial conference, Zuma said the alliance did not discuss the matter."The matter is sub-judice. The ANC will respond to some of the issues pertaining to the matter but the alliance did not discuss the matter," said Zuma.Cosatu's provincial secretary, Edwin Mkhize, said after the Dlamini-Zuma commission, many people complained that the alliance did not act on the findings."As the commission, we are willing to correct the mistakes we made," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
