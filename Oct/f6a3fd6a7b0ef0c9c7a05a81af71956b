He must take responsibility as man. His actions are cowardice." Phosa said Abrahams' actions&nbsp;were "the grease&nbsp;to the wheel" to his earlier application to have the General Council of the Bar disbar him. "I have already written to bar council to investigate his fitness to hold his position... this is just grease to the wheels already in motion."Phosa said he filled his application to the bar council two weeks ago after reading the affidavits by the&nbsp;Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation to the NPA to have charges against minister of finance Pravin Gordhan dropped. "I did go to bar council two weeks ago and they sent me an acknowledgement of receipt... He needs to be investigated after the affidavit from the Helen Suzman Foundation."The&nbsp;EFF has also called on the General Council of the Bar to disbar Abrahams.The party also wants Abrahams struck from the roll of advocates, News24 reported earlier.- Read the article hereAbrahams withdrew fraud charges against Gordhan, former SARS boss Oupa Magashula and former SARS deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay,&nbsp;saying that he was satisfied that the trio did not have the requisite intention to act unlawfully.&nbsp; He told journalists it was in the Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation's application that the NPA was made aware of a legal opinion in 2009 by senior SARS employee Vlok Symington that the early retirement of Pillay was above board.Abrahams said Symington's opinion showed there was no intent to commit fraud by Gordhan, former Sars commissioner Oupa Magashula and Pillay.It was made public last week that Symington was allegedly held hostage by Hawks' officers after he was mistakenly given a document containing an emailed opinion of a Sars lawyer in which the lawyer states that he holds a different opinion to the Hawks in the case against Gordhan.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
