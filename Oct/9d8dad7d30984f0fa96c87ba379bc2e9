The palace said the king passed away peacefully on Thursday at Bangkok's Siriraj Hospital. The palace statement did not mention details of mourning or succession. Bhumibol Adulyadej (pronounced poo-mee-pon ah-dun-yaa-det) became king in 1946 and was revered in Thailand as a demigod. He anchored the Southeast Asian country through violent upheavals at home and communist revolutions next door with a blend of majesty and a common touch. The once-vigorous king had withdrawn from public life over the last decade due to his ill health. He lived at a Bangkok hospital and had been notably silent about the political upheaval that has shaken Thailand in recent years. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
