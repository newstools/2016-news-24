They beat Bhanda way more than they beat us. They called us kaffirs and tsotsis."Bobo said those that were not arrested, himself included, were made to clean Mtshingana&rsquo;s blood from their vehicle following the alleged assault."They made us wash his blood off the car we were driving. They confiscated a phone because we were taking pictures."Allegations of assaultAccording to Bobo, Mtshingana sustained a serious injury to his throat during the arrest."During the altercation they hurt him, causing a hole in his throat.
