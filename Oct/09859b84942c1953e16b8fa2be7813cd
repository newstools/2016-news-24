It will be wave number two," said the source.The National Prosecuting Authority charged Gordhan with fraud. This was related to his giving permission for former deputy Sars commissioner Ivan Pillay to go on early retirement, and then extending his contract. The source said this was because the justice sector needed a charge that would stick to Gordhan. &nbsp;"Make no mistake, the 'rogue unit' case will come."The source said there was an urgency to lay a charge against Gordhan because of pressure being placed on current Sars commissioner Tom Moyane, the upcoming Public Protector report on state capture, and Treasury blocking questionable deals."It&rsquo;s a timing issue. They had to go with something now and they chose what they thought was the simplest case."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
