He was arrested around 10:50 on the lower campus on a charge of malicious damage to property, national police spokesperson Brigadier Sally de Beer said. The arrest came after around 200 protesting students damaged the Kramer building “by throwing stones and human faeces”. “Police were forced to take action to quell the situation and the crowd was dispersed.” The student would appear in the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court once charged. On Monday, the university initially said it and several other institutions were declared a “level-three security situation” by acting national police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane. This, in effect, meant the public order unit was in command of the institution. "Vice-Chancellors remain fully in control of the campuses and work with the SAPS to manage any situation where the SAPS may be needed," it said in a correction statement. In Monday morning's statement it said: “We face a level of protest this morning which we are not able to contain with private security officers alone.” It said protesters disrupted activities on its middle and upper campuses, breaking windows, forcing open locked doors, and throwing faeces. “There are further reports of intimidation, damage to property, violence, disruption and confrontation with security officers and we need the support of SAPS’s Public Order Policing to manage the situation.”   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
