It will next go to the Senate - also dominated by the ruling party - before being approved by President Pierre Nkurunziza.In April, ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said she was conducting a "preliminary examination" of the situation in Burundi - the first step towards a full investigation and possible prosecutions - looking into allegations including murder, torture, rape and forced disappearances.And two weeks ago the United Nations launched a high-level probe into rights violations in Burundi after a report warned of possible "crimes against humanity" and the risk of genocide."It is perfectly clear that this is a plot to do harm to Burundi," Gaston Sindimwo, Burundi's vice president, said last week, referring to the investigations.Burundi's move to leave the Netherlands-based court also comes amid rising resentment in Africa against the ICC, which leaders accuse of targeting only countries on the continent.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
