First, we repeatedly asked the NPA to afford the minister an opportunity to make representations to them before they decided whether to prosecute the minister, but they spurned our requests."When announcing his decision to charge Gordhan, Abrahams had been clear on his commitment to the prosecution, Malatji said."Having now had an opportunity to study the charges against the minister, it is also clear to us that they manifest a resolute and not well-founded determination to prosecute the minister at all costs. Any representations to the NDPP would accordingly be pointless."WATCH this video:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
