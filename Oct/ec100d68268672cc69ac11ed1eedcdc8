Powerful voices spoke up for the people of Tafelberg and Bromwell Street, currently victims of the age-old policy to move poor people to the edges of town in order to make way for the relentless gentrification facilitated by City of Cape Town officials following the dictates of developers and their money.&rdquo; &ldquo;This was eloquently put by Mary Burton, former president of the Black Sash and TRC commissioner, and by Peter Storey, reverend of the nearby Buitenkant Street Methodist congregation at the time of the removals,&rdquo; continues Ajam. Inveterate campaigner Di Oliver spoke of the dream of claimants coming home to the heart of the City and the need to heal the wound inflicted half a century earlier, a theme echoed by anti-apartheid campaigner Horst Kleinschmidt, who spoke on behalf of the newly formed Active Citizens Alliance of Cape Town. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
