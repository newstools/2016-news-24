"It's not true," said Lieutenant Colonel Andre Traut. He said he had been asked about a shooting with the same details on Thursday, which turned out to be untrue. "We have no record of any incident like that in the Lavender Hill area. We regard that as incorrect. It is inaccurate and devoid of truth." He asked people to be cautious about what they share on social media "because it affects people's lives". However, the police understand that people pass these messages on in the spirit of trying to protect friends and family from crime, but they should be more wary of the information they receive, he said. Traut said sometimes people who log in to their Facebook account after a break see a message about a real incident and don't check the date before sharing it. But in this case, he could not remember such an incident in that area not just recently, but in all his years as a media liaison officer.   An agent at Trust Property told News24 that the message came through on a WhatsApp group they are part of. He did not know any details about the supposed shooting, nor who in the team posted it. A call to the web team went unanswered. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
