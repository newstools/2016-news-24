Mpho Mokoma, who is in Grade 4 at Kgutliso Primary School, was walking to school on her own last Wednesday when two dogs attacked her, Netwerk24 reported. She lives with her grandmother while her parents work outside of town. "Her thighs are torn up and her wounds are deep," her father Emmanuel Mokoma said by phone. He was only informed about the incident the day after it happened. "Luckily, somebody was there to help her. She cried and screamed a lot." Charges Mpho was taken to the Dihlabeng Hospital in Bethlehem where she received emergency surgery. "She is doing a bit better. Slowly but surely," her dad said. Her parents said they have laid a charge at the local police station. "We are not happy about how the case is being handled," Mokoma said. "The police have been very unhelpful and I am unsure if we have done it correctly." Police spokesperson Captain Zweli Mohobeleli said they had not received a complaint regarding a dog attack. Netwerk24 gave him the case number but, according to Mohobeleli, the case number was for a different charge. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
