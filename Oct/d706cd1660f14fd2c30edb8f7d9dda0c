Hacked emails released by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks show that Hillary Clinton did not want her husband to cancel the speech, but was eventually convinced that cancelling was the right step. Campaign manager Robby Mook said he realised cancelling the speech would disappoint both Clintons, but he said, "it's a very consequential unforced error and could plague us in stories for months". Clinton's campaign had long been worried about appearing to be too close to Wall Street banks. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
