Watch.WATCH Cape Town - Former SARS deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay says he expects to be cleared of any wrongdoing after being summonsed to appear in court with Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and another former colleague, Oupa Magashula. "Mr Pillay is of the considered opinion that the charges are without any merit and that he will be cleared of any wrongdoing in due course," a statement issued on his behalf said. "Mr Pillay will follow due process and shall take such steps as are necessary to protect his rights and to defend himself in accordance with the rule of law." The three are expected to appear in the Pretoria Regional Court on November 2, according to an announcement by National Prosecuting Authority head Shaun Abrahams on Tuesday. The announcement comes in a year of uncertainty over Gordhan's fate after information was leaked earlier this year indicating that he was being investigated by the Hawks. On Tuesday, Abrahams said the charges related to an amount of R1.1m allegedly paid to Pillay for early retirement from the government employees' pension fund without him being entitled to it.
