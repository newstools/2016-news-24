Bridget.SiebertTHE letters in Fever of 28 September by V. Surujpaul, G. Grantham and UKZN Student all bear reference. The wilful destruction of property, burning of irreplaceable resources, and the smearing of faeces in lecture rooms are arrogant acts of vandalism. Those engaging in such grossly despicable acts should not be in an institution of higher learning in the first place. By committing such ghastly acts students are advertising to the world their depth of barbarism, and the baring of their upper bodies by some females is public indecency. All these are illegal, punishable offences, yet video footage show law enforcement agencies just watching - no one was arrested for public indecency. Their inaction is puzzling to law-abiding citizens.Grantham s letter makes good sense, but unfortunately, not many parents have the time to be with their children as most are employed and contributing to the economy.Our Constitution guarantees free basic education . Some political parties are mischievously adding tertiary education to gain political acceptance among the masses. Most democratic states assist top students to achieve their full potential, with the anticipation that such students expertise will be beneficial to the future advancement of the country as a whole.The majority of South African students, who are currently in tertiary institutions with a bare minimum of a 30% pass, are neither top performers, nor will they develop expertise to benefit the country positively. Their behaviour is developing exactly the opposite.It is a pity that some political parties cannot realise the long-term damaging effects of their current short-sightedness.
