They have all fled their homes in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo.Some of them are already married but, having lost their wedding certificates when they left their homes, are going through the process again. Others, like Bonnet Mfaume and Zubeda Karinga, are marrying each other for the first time. Bonnet is pregnant with their fifth child and describes her "unusual happiness" about the occasion. It is a cause for celebration at a time when they have had little to feel positive about.&nbsp; But marriage can mean more than that for the refugees. Abel Mbilinyi, the Burundi representative for the UNHCR, explains that marriage offers "protection for women". "In a refugee camp, depending on which religion you are having, depending on culture, the protection of a husband is so important," he continues. "Women who are single are vulnerable. They are vulnerable to being attacked by single men." &nbsp;MORE: Is the DRC on the brink of collapse? Deo Kasereka and Antoinette Etamboseka are among those waiting to get married.
