The arson and vandalism were aimed at making it lose public sympathy and credibility and being committed by "charlatans and counter-revolutionaries".On Tuesday, 19 students were arrested at CPUT's Bellville, Cape Town and Mowbray campuses after clashes with police.Twelve would remain in custody for an additional week as police confirmed their alternative addresses.
