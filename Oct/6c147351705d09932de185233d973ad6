The president is enjoying very robust health and is continuing to carry on his functions and duties whilst in the USA."&nbsp;"We would like to remind all Malawians that in response to the so many inquiries as to what the president is doing in the USA, the Presidential Press Secretary, Mr Mgeme Kalirani, has repeatedly stated that the president is continuing to carry out other duties which could not be concluded whilst he was at the United Nations General Assembly," Ndau said.Ndau went further to warn Malawians over the rumours, reminding them that the spreading of the false stories was a criminal offence and that "rumour-mongers" would be swiftly brought to book.Meanwhile, #BringBackMutharika has been trending on Twitter as Malawians have become frustrated over Mutharika's prolonged stay in the US.Dear World,#Malawi President Peter Mutharika, who left the country on 15th Sept, is still missing somewhere in the US#BringBackMutharika&mdash; Idriss Ali Nassah (@mynassah) October 6, 2016#BringBackMutharika trends in Malawi as President mysteriously remains in US two weeks after UN appearance.
