We hope to be able to start afresh and correct the errors of the past," said Andriamamonjy."We will do our best to set up local projects - because that is what the people want -- before really embarking on mining proper," she added.One of the conditions of Jiuxing Mines' licence was that it build roads, electrify the town, renovate one health centre and build another one.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
