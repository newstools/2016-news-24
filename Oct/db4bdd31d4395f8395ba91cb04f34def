We want people to be taken to court when there is a proper investigation and enough evidence. We want our people to defend themselves before the courts of law. If they have lawyers, let their lawyers defend them in the court."We don't want our members to listen to the media and say we have read this in newspapers, so this one and that one must be arrested, or this one and that must be fired from the party. No, we don&rsquo;t do that..," Mugabe was quoted as saying,"&nbsp;NewsDay&nbsp;quoted Mugabe as saying.The opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) recently called on the country's anti-graft agency to clampdown on all those found on the wrong side of the law regardless of their positions.&nbsp;MDC spokesperson Obert Gutu said that the Zimbabwe Anti&ndash;Corruption Commission (ZACC) should be allowed to stick to its constitutional mandate without fear or favour. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
