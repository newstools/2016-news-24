The meeting was part of ongoing interventions by the provincial government and inkosi of the aBathembu clan, Siphamandla Mthembu, to bring peace and stability in the community. Kaunda said the meeting was the second meeting following the brutal killing of four people in eSdakeni two weeks ago, in what was believed to be a feud involving the two families."More than 22 people have been killed since 2014 in conflict related to the taxi industry, but escalated into what is now seen as a full-scale faction fight, pitting the warring families against each other in the greater Ladysmith area."Kaunda called on the two families to disown hitmen who were terrorising the community."What is heartbreaking is that the two families involved in this conflict are related. We commend them for participating in these talks and we thank them for their commitment towards peace in the area. Working together with local inkosi we will continue to engage the two families to end the conflict," said Kaunda.He said police would remain in the area to monitor the situation. The meeting resolved that the families involved in the conflict should come together to cement peace and the local inkosi would ensure the cleansing of all the affected families."For the sake of future generations and development in the area, please let bygones be bygones and end this conflict once and for all," Kaunda said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
