Tshidi Madia and Mahlatse Gallens, News24  Pretoria - Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's report on “state capture” is not expected to be released on Friday, the High Court in Pretoria heard. Pushed by Judge Fourie about whether the interim report would be released today, Madonsela’s  counsel said no. Local Government Minister Des Van Rooyen is seeking an interdict to stop the release of the report. He argues in court papers that he was only given 24 hours to respond to the public protector’s “adverse findings” against him. Van Rooyen says in the documents that he was given until October 12 to respond to the allegations. “The receipt of this letter was the first time I have become aware that the Public Protector’s investigation into the Gupta family entails the investigations of allegations concerning me. I have never been asked to give evidence or make submissions to the Public Protector during the course of this investigation,” he said.Madonsela’s legal team however told the court that no findings or recommendations had been made against Van Rooyen.Opposition political parties, led by the EFF, were in court to ask for an order that the report be preserved and protected. The matter was adjourned to allow the parties to decide on an order.  Madonsela signed the report, meaning it could not be changed by incoming Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane.President Jacob Zuma had applied for an interdict to stop the release of the report. This would be heard on Tuesday.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
