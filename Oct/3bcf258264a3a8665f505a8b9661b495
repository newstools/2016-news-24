Watch.WATCHJohannesburg -&nbsp;President Jacob Zuma told Public Protector Thuli Madonsela his lawyers let him down on the Nkandla matter, she told News24 on Tuesday.Madonsela was speaking at News24's first livestreamed Frontline conversation on Tuesday."I explained to him what decisions were made and why and he explained to me he had received bad advice from his lawyers and he had come to understand that the powers were binding," she said referring to the powers of the office of the Public Protector. Madonsela ends her seven-year tenure on October 14, handing over the reins to Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane. Although Madonsela's favourite cases involved "Gogo Dlamini" and the ordinary person, she was defined in her latter years in office by Zuma's resistance to a finding in her report,&nbsp;Secure in Comfort,&nbsp;that he repay some of the R249m spent on security upgrades to his home in Nkandla. Madonsela said it was from Zuma that she heard for the first time that the money would indeed be paid, despite earlier insistence by himself and the ANC in Parliament that she did not have the power to make him pay.The matter was heard at the Constitutional Court following an application by the Economic Freedom Fighters and the Democratic Alliance who wanted clarity on the Public Protector's powers so that Zuma could "pay back the money".In September the Presidency said he paid back the R7.8m he owed for the upgrades. A panel of six experts from two quantity surveyor firms had helped Treasury determine how much Zuma had to pay back for the upgrades.Treasury recommended Zuma pay R7.81m for non-security-related features including R2.3m for the so-called fire pool, R1m for an amphitheatre and R1.2m for a cattle kraal.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
