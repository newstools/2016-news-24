Because it will present the party with two very clear choices. Either, its Parliamentary Caucus could appreciate the current societal malaise, introspect, and vote with conscience in supporting the motion to remove Jacob Zuma from office.&rdquo;Or the ANC could show their full confidence in Zuma "and defend the indefensible at all costs", the DA said. &nbsp;"This is a golden opportunity for the ANC to stop playing 'hot potato' politics; we all know the root cause of our country&rsquo;s current turmoil, and the time for passing blame is over. The ANC must work with us in Parliament to remove Jacob Zuma, once and for all, so we can get our country working again."The party had written to the speaker to have the motion included in this term&rsquo;s programme.It would not be looking for a secret ballot, the DA said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
