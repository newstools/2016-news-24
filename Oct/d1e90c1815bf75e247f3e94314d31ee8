Taxis, motorists and truck drivers now use the lanes to circumvent the traffic. This leads to unnecessary road rage and accidents. We want to prevent it. They will only be used when the bus service is rolled out, said Kayser. He added that the roads will be maintained so that they are in good condition when the IPTS buses started running. We have received only positive feedback from the public about the barriers. They are happy that order has been restored on the roads. I also use Stanford Road on a daily basis and experience the flow of traffic with all the other motorists who are in a hurry to get to their destinations in the mornings. When a taxi or car in an unauthorized lane pushes in front of you, unnecessary frustration is caused, said Kayser.The barricades were erected from the Cleary Park Shopping Centre to the Stanford Road and Chase Street intersection.According to Kayser, the IPTS will be in operation in April next year with the route from Cleary Park to the Port Elizabeth city centre and the Nelson Mandela University being the first. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
