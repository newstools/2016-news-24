In rand value this equates to a R243,63 difference, from R1 616,97 in September last year to R1 860,60 this year.In a household were the breadwinner earns a minimum wage of R1 800, and on average supports five family members, maintaining basic nutrition is near impossible.Pacsa&rsquo;s findings reveal that the prices of 25 of the 36 foods in their basket have increased by more than 22% within a year.For example, the price of a 10 kg pocket of onions increased by 75% and a pocket of potatoes by 68%.Maize meal, which is an essential food product in low-income households, increased by 32% from R170,80 to R225,82.In determining the impact of inflation on low-income households and their ability to secure a diverse nutritional standard, Pacsa says the most important food types are what their focus group calls &ldquo;the big foods&rdquo;.This includes maize meal, rice, cake flour, white sugar and cooking oil.&ldquo;These are the foods which households have to have regardless of price because they provide the basis for all meals. They are prioritised first,&rdquo; the report said.The total cost of these foods increased by 25% and cost R120,54 more than they did last year. &ldquo;It means that more money in the household food budget has to be spent to secure these foods. &ldquo;This trend will therefore suggest deterioration in nutrition levels in our populace&rdquo;.Speaking about their findings, Pacsa&rsquo;s Mervyn Abrahams and Julie Smith both agreed that food prices in 2017 will depend on whether farmers have been able to plant and harvest enough crops as the drought continues.&ldquo;The South African agricultural system is far too vulnerable to drought,&rdquo; Smith said.Looking ahead to the festive season, Smith said this is a period of high increases, not because of inflation or drought, but because of retailers cashing in on celebrations.&ldquo;Food prices will always fluctuate but the ability of a household to source that food remains the same. The budget for food decreases and we are very concerned about what the picture would look like next year,&rdquo; Smith said.Speaking to The Witness on Thursday, Mama Ntombi&rsquo;s Community Project co-ordinator Sandra Pillay said they provide food to and conduct awareness projects among residents in Ezinkethini, where most of the population is unemployed.Pillay said the food price increases are evident.&ldquo;We can see the residents are struggling more than usual and we are encouraging them to start food gardens but water in the area is also scarce. It was a real struggle last year and it will be worse next year,&rdquo; Pillay said. &ldquo;Their diet is not conducive to healthy living, but what choice to they have?&rdquo; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
