Tim spent many hours at a time working in our archives with Madiba's private papers. It was Tim who conceived of the style of the book after Meditations by the roman emperor Marcus Aurelius," the foundation said in a statement."We will miss Tim's wisdom which he shared generously, but with great humility. Most of all we will miss his wicked sense of humour."Chief executive of the foundation Sello Hatang said: "I will never forget how whenever you paid Tim a compliment he would downplay it and instead turn it around to make you look good."&nbsp;The cause of 72-year-old Couzens' death was not immediately known.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
