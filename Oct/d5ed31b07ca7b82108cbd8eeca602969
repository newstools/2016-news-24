According to the new model, all application and award processes usually carried out by Unisa had to be transferred to NSFAS as part of a pilot project.This meant the institutional knowledge relating to the process at Unisa was lost and led to less NSFAS funding at the university.Makhanya lauded Higher Education and Training Minister Blade Nzimande's announcement that students from households earning less than R600 000 a year would not have their fees increased for a second year running.At the same time, he said he hoped that a solution to the fees crisis could be found without adversely affecting poor students. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
