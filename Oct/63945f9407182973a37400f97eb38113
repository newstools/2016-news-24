This has led in part to the anger that has spilled over in recent weeks," said Felix Horne, Human Rights Watch's lead researcher on Ethiopia."Deploying more of those same abusive security forces to restore law and order is unlikely to improve long-term stability," Horne said, instead urging the government to address protesters' grievances and allow space for opposition voices.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
