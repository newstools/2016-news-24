Iraqi forces, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and their international allies have already cleared dozens of villages on the outskirts of Mosul. However, the fight against ISIL, also known as ISIS, has been complicated by territorial arguments between Iraqi and Kurdish forces, with the Kurds angling to assert control over certain disputed areas liberated from ISIL. From the Bashiqa frontline, just 20km from Mosul, a mountain top offers a clear view of the city, from where hundreds of thousands of residents are expected to flee as the battle unfolds. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
