In Pittsburgh on Saturday, Clinton assailed incumbent Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, saying he had failed to "stand up" to Donald Trump in the face of his comments about Mexican immigrants and a Muslim-American military family. "If he doesn't have the courage to stand up to Donald Trump after all of this, then can you be sure that he will stand up for you when it counts?" Clinton said. Toomey is locked in a tight race with Democratic challenger Katie McGinty. Clinton called McGinty "exactly the kind of senator that Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania needs." The attacks on Toomey were a new effort from the presidential nominee, who has largely focused her fire on Trump. Clinton did note that some Republicans have had the "grits and the guts" to push back against Trump. Still, Clinton told reporters on her plane in Pittsburgh that she does plan to focus more on helping other Democrats. The move shows her growing confidence in her own race and her hope that Democrats recapture the Senate. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
