They would also subsidise the increases for students who fell&nbsp;into the "missing middle", where households earned up to R600 000.Following his announcement, protests flared up at tertiary institutions around the country, with students demanding free education&nbsp;Answering questions from the commission on Thursday on why the missing middle had been largely ignored by government, Nzimande said it was due to the demands of poor students, and government resources.&nbsp;"It had to do with the demand and what government saw as a priority. Government thought that we need to drastically expand access to the poor and also because of inadequate resources."&nbsp;He added that another challenge for government was the large number of poor students who qualified for NSFAS. He said government was also facing challenges in funding poor students.&nbsp;Nzimande said an unintended consequence for the 0% increase, which resulted in government paying for university fee increases, was that it took money "earmarked for Masters and PhD scholarships to actually produce the lectures that we need".&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
