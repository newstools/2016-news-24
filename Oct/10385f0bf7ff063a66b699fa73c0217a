He said Mantwa came into his life when Ratanang was eight.&ldquo;I tell Ratanang to wash dishes, I give him difficult tasks and I never create an impression that things are easy, because when you tell him that we grew up without a television at home he tells you &lsquo;No, that is not possible daddy&rsquo;.&rdquo;Malema said he was a good father because he looked after his son, and everyone else who depended on him.&ldquo;My grandmother is [like] my daughter. She must be looked after. She is my queen.
