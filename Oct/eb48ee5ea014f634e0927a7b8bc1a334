Iran's official IRNA news agency quoted Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi late on Wednesday as saying several foreign nationals were detained with some 100kg of explosives. State television also reported the arrests. Alavi said the suspects planned to attack events in Iran's southern Fars province. He referred to the suspects as "takfiri terrorists," a term used by Iranian officials to describe militant Sunni fundamentalists like the Islamic State group. There was no other information immediately released. Iran has helped Shi’ite militias fighting against ISIS in Iraq. In June, Iran said it broke up one of the "biggest terrorist plots" ever on its soil by Sunni extremists. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
