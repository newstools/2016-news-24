However consumers had failed to adhere to this. It was gazetted on August 12 and implemented on September 6.&ldquo;Sadly we didn&rsquo;t see the kind of reduction in consumption that we needed to see,&rdquo; Rand Water chairperson Tshidi Hashatse said.This pushed Rand Water and the department to take a tougher stance and water supplies to all municipalities across the province were cut by 15%. However, the onus was not only on the municipalities, but also on households to ensure they used their water wisely.Mokonyane said if water consumption did not reduce between November and January, the entire Vaal River system could collapse. Mokonyane said agriculture made up 62% of the country&rsquo;s water use, urban domestic users 23%, rural consumers 4%, and power generation 2%.&nbsp;However, in Gauteng, 79% of the water went to urban domestic use, 9% to mining and other industrial activity, 6% to agriculture, and 5% to power generation.Of the 79% going to domestic urban use, 40% went towards non-human consumption such as gardening and recreational activities, Mokonyane said.In order to succeed in saving water, it was critical that Gauteng households played their part.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
