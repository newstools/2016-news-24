If we are going to keep our universities functional and retain the quality, then we need to ensure that we get all the stakeholders participating in the university system. The private sector is one such participant."Long-term solutionsREAD: Case against Wits students postponed Three very distinctive partnerships could emerge between universities and the private sector, Habib said."The first is as a donor to support scholarship. The second is as partners where they support research by establishing research chairs and having corporate research arms established at universities. And third, and very importantly, [is] working with us in rethinking our curriculum."He said what was required of the professional in 2016 was "profoundly different" from what was required sixteen years ago."We need to constantly innovate in our curriculum, and having private sector engagement in our curriculum committees is absolutely important in facilitating a curriculum that speaks to the realities of the economy, of the corporates and to the skillsets that our students require."Absa CEO Maria Ramos said the company felt it had a responsibility to contribute while long-term solutions to higher education funding were developed.Students in September started protests over free education after Higher Education and Training Minister Blade Nzimande announced he would cap university fee increments at 8%.WATCH this video:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
