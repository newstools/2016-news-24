Some ANC members had claimed State resources were being abused to force him out of office due to his attempts to crack down on corruption and maladministration in President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s Cabinet. Others have called on him to face the music in court.Mantashe said the case should not be allowed to divide the party.&ldquo;We must accept that ANC members have different views on this matter. We must&nbsp;facilitate an engagement of ANC views on the matter,&nbsp;so that we agree on how to deal with it,&rdquo;&nbsp;Mantashe said.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
