At least one Facebook group has been set up to share news of fines and warn other users of possible instances of unscrupulous behaviour by traffic police (a ploy recorded this week is for police in a spot near Harare to use a speed camera that allegedly has a speeding offence pre-recorded on it).Police in Zimbabwe can charge a maximum of $20 per "spot fine". But unfortunately some officers "group" fines together for a single driver so that the total amount he or she is forced to pay up is well above this sum. That's despite Zimbabwe's ongoing cash shortages, which have abruptly worsened this week.But road police in Zambia are equally unpopular, judging from recent comments on the RTSA Facebook page.A proposal this week from the agency to ban secondhand tyres in Zambia sounds remarkably similar to a Zimbabwe police clampdown on "biscuit" spare wheels, the solid wheels that are sold with many cars imported from Japan.Zambians have accused the agency of forcing locals to buy from a single major tyre retailer. A Facebook user says: "But second hand cars from Japan come with second hand tyres. How about that?"If it's any comfort to angry Zimbabwe drivers, it seems that it's not just traffic police in their country who have ready cash.A transcript of a Zambian parliamentary debate from April has one MP stating: "Every child in the compounds longs to be a traffic officer&rsquo;s son or daughter because it is only in those officers&rsquo; homes where the aroma of frying chicken can be smelt in the evening because traffic officers get money from offenders without issuing receipts." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
