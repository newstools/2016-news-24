Mpho Raborife, News24 Grahamstown - Rhodes University has vowed to continue with
its academic programme, despite overnight clashes during which three buildings
and three service cars were damaged and a number of people were arrested.   According to the university, disruptions began on Monday
evening and ended around 00:30 on Tuesday morning. "In the early evening, protesters attempted to enter
the Barratt lecture complex with the apparent intention of disrupting a test
which was taking place. Glass doors to the complex were broken in the process. "Protesters then moved to the library, where more glass
was broken, before progressing to upper campus where, again, stones and rocks
were thrown at windows and entrances. "Extensive damage also occurred in the Biko Building.
Three university service vehicles were overturned at the rear of the building." The university said stun grenades and rubber bullets were
used by members of the public order policing unit. A number of arrests were
also made during the course of the evening, it added.    The university thanked all those who stayed up throughout
the night, and into the morning, helping to clean up and remove broken glass,
as well as those who continue to keep the academic programme going. "We are extremely grateful to staff who continue to
support us in keeping the academic programme running, the contribution of
wardens and other staff who worked throughout the disruptions to calm their
students in particular," it said. Police could not immediately be reached for comment on the
number of people arrested and what they had been charged with. Student newspaper Activate tweeted that eight male students
and two female students were arrested on Monday night.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
