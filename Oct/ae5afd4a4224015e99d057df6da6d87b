	      MOTHER of two, Jean Nyembezi (35), a female boxer in Kokstad, is looking to get women involved as a form of self-protection, and fun.  Nyembezi trains girls between the ages of 12 and 19 at the Greater Kokstad Boxing Club. “Women think that boxing is for males and people must remember that there are women in boxing, which is also for self-defence and keeps the body healthy.” In the nineties there used to be a boxing club in Kokstad, but it closed many years ago. Now the KZN Department of Sport and Recreation has donated boxing equipment - punching bags, gloves, first aid kit and boxing body protectors for males and females - to the Kokstad Boxing Club. The Greater Kokstad Municipality is to support the female boxers by providing Thuntulwana Hall in Bongweni for training. “I want to ensure that women participate in sport, for example, soccer, boxing and tennis.  “Nothing says sport is only for men.”  The Greater Kokstad Boxing Club works with Kokstad schools to train pupils in boxing and some will attend boxing training in the December holidays.  John Motsa, Safa technical director in Harry Gwala, thanked club members for reintroducing boxing to Kokstad. “Sport is growing in Harry Gwala, and we support boxing.”            24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
