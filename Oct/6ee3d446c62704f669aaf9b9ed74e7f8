He claimed Panayiotou destroyed the SIM card.He said the phone made him feel uneasy and it was when he was signing the documents that led to his dismissal that he made the demand for R150 000 hush money.He claimed to have called the house to speak to Fanoula after he made the threat to find out what the family was going to do.But Panayiotou's lawyer, Terry Price, said on Thursday he had a recording and transcript of the conversation to prove that that was not the content of the conversation.Ndedwa said he eventually contacted the police in February about the phone after seeing in the Herald newspaper that police were trying to track the owner of that number.It was collected from him and handed to investigating officer Lieutenant Kanna Swanepoel.Salary advancesREAD: Cross-examination of Panayiotou's ex-employee to continueOn Friday, Price said the newspaper had not run such an article.Price also established through cross-examination that Ndedwa frequently received advances on his salary from Panayiotou and not all were deducted from his pay.Court was adjourned and cleared for prosecutor Marius Stander to hear the recording because he had not been privy to it yet.On Thursday the court also heard that he spotted a bag of money in a storeroom of the family business and that Panayiotou asked him to give it to colleague Luthando Siyoni.Siyoni did not come into work that day and the next time he looked, the money was gone.When court resumed it was confirmed that the recording and transcript were the same.Panayiotou, Sinethemba Nenembe and Zolani Sibeko are on trial on charges of conspiring, kidnapping, robbing and killing Jayde, 29.
