The officer said the extremists were released on Wednesday night in Banki, a town on the northeast border with Cameroon. The officer spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the press on the matter. He said the freed girls were flown by helicopter to Maiduguri, the northeastern capital of Borno state and birthplace of Boko Haram. Nigeria's government said the release of the girls is the result of negotiations with Boko Haram. The girls are the first to be released as a result of government action. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
