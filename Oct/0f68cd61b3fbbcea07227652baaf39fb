The search was initiated after numerous complaints of learners being in possession of dangerous weapons and drugs. Police also received complaints of drug dealing at the school. “We told them that once one has a criminal record it will be difficult to get a job so they should not be involved in activities that will lead to them being arrested and having a criminal record,” he says. Police officers searched the bags of the learners and their classrooms and confiscated: . 37 lighters; . 5 knives; . 3 boxes of matches; . 13 loose cigarettes; . 21 bankies of dagga; and . drug tools. “We also confiscated a piece of wood sharpened as a knife. Parents send their children to school to have an education and some tend to fall off the wagon and get involved in illegal activities. Children must understand that their lives lie ahead and by getting involved in the wrong things they will jeopardise their future. “This is the last term for the year and learners are encouraged to stay focused on their schoolwork and study. Only through an education will one prosper,” says Bartlett. No arrests were made during the search. V Contact Steenberg police on 021 702 9000.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
