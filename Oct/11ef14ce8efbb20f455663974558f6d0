He said the curfew, from 18:30 to 06:30 would begin on Thursday and remain in place until December 27.It would be enforced along a 20km buffer zone of towns and territory reaching to the Somalia border.This week's attack was the second in Mandera in less than three weeks, with both claimed by the al-Qaeda-linked Shabaab group.The Shabaab has fought to overthrow the internationally-backed government in Mogadishu since 2007, but turned its sights on Kenya when the army was sent into Somalia in 2011 to fight the Islamic insurgents.Since then the militants have targeted civilians in different parts of Kenya, including a dramatic assault on Nairobi's Westgate shopping mall in 2013 in which at least 67 people were killed.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
