Because over the years we have seen the change of government from NDC [National Democratic Congress] to NPP [New Patriotic Party] and from NPP back to NDC, and yet Ghana still struggles with economic crisis. That specifically tells us that one political party alone cannot be able to manage our country," said Ayariga.The political landscape in Ghana consisted of two main parties, the ruling NDC party led by President John Dramani Mahama and the main opposition party, the NPP led by Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.Ayariga said that despite the two main parties enjoying a majority with voters, he disagreed with the assumption that it would be difficult for him to be elected as president.Some supporters of Ghana's opposition NPP party claimed that Ayariga's newly formed APC party was being funded by the ruling party purely to destabilise the opposition to maintain a firm hold of power.President Mahama recently announced his reelection manifesto at a rally in the central Brong Ahafo region, promising high economic growth and more jobs ahead of December polls.Addressing a large crowd, Mahama defended his economic track record after Ghana's growth slid below 4% in 2015, the slowest in over a decade. The West African country was once hailed as a regional growth model but has lost its lustre after taking on too much debt, with electricity shortages compounding the pain of low export revenues. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
