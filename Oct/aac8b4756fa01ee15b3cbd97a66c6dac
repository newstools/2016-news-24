When donkeys are stolen, this can have a devastating effect on the family who rely on these donkeys, added Inspector Semenya.Donkey owners are therefore encouraged to inspect their donkeys every day to ensure they are safe. If owners put their donkeys into kraals at night to keep them safe, they must also ensure that they provide water for them to drink, especially during this drought. Semenya urged members of the community to be vigilant and to report any suspicious activity around their donkeys to their nearest police station.
