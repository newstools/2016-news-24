I want to put [out] an appeal to all my comrades, brothers, sisters and families to put pressure on the South African government to insist that they release me as soon as possible," she said.Another crew member, Mairead Maguire from Northern Ireland, said they were intercepted in international waters and taken to Israel.Naidoo wrote in a diary entry, published by salaamedia.com, that most boats in the "Freedom Flotilla" were rerouted to the Israeli port of Ashdod, where the Israeli Defence Force would question, process, and deport them."From here, we will either be moved to a prison or our deportation will be done while we are being held at the detention centre. Our embassies will come to help us and our legal representatives will do the same. Hopefully our mission will highlight the unlawful and inhumane blockade of Palestine."The international Freedom Flotilla Coalition is a global movement aimed at helping Gaza's residents.The Israeli government said on previous occasions that its land and sea blockade of Gaza was aimed at preventing Palestinian fundamentalist organisation Hamas from getting weapons and supplies.Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007, and was allegedly seeking to destroy Israel.&nbsp;&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
