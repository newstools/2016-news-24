Margarita Segou told The Associated Press that the important thing to realise is that while the number of temblors will decline over time, "we cannot exclude the possibility of larger magnitude aftershocks". She cited other regions, such as a series of quakes in Japan earlier this year, which saw a similar pattern in which a quake is followed by a larger aftershock. The quake on Sunday that struck near Norcia in central Italy measured magnitude 6.6 and was the strongest to hit the country in 36 years. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
