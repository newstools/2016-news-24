Yes, we can commend ourselves and say we did well and won the elections, but we did suffer some injuries which were a result of divisions among ourselves, Mthembu said.He said these Wards are Madundube (Ward 27), Darnall (Ward 2) and Ward 15 in Ndwedwe. He said the party historically enjoyed majority support in these areas.Mthembu said the party lacks members and leaders who are revolutionary and have ideas that can influence the party and its members and steer it towards its cause for a national democratic revolution. But we have members who gossip about each other, speaking about personal issues rather than political issues, issues that have nothing to do with what we are pursuing as the ANC, he said.The regional chairperson said he is pleased that none of the branches within the ANC Greater KwaDukuza region are applicants of a court bid seeking to scrap the party s provincial leadership elected last year.The court bid, filed weeks before this year s local government elections, seeks to scrap the outcome of the ANC s elective conference held last year which resulted with Senzo Mchunu being ousted by Willies Mchunu as the party s provincial chairperson.He said branch leadership across the board should be mandated by its members to raise concerns about outcomes of elective conferences rather than take a personal decision to contest the results. He said the KwaDukuza region is targeted by external and internal forces hell bent on sowing divisions within its ranks.The forum also focused on topical issues, namely BRICS, the #FeesMustFall campaign and the matter between the finance minister Pravin Gordhan and the National Prosecuting Authority.Mthembu said the #FeesMustFall campaign has been hijacked by those seeking to destabilise the country in an effort to usurp the ANC as the ruling party. He said certain media organisations and political parties are part of this campaign seeking a regime change in South Africa.Speaking on behalf of ANC provincial chairperson Sihle Zikalala, the provincial executive committee member who is also a mayor of the Jozini Municipality Solo Mkhombo reiterated much of Mthembu s sentiments, and called on the party s members to emulate the leadership qualities and traits of Oliver Tambo in an effort to keep the organisation unified.He said the party supports the fees must fall movement but does not condone violence.But we have members who gossip about each other, speaking about personal issues rather than political issues.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
