The matter can only be reassessed on appeal if there are new facts."After so many years, and having been thrashed out for so long, it's almost impossible to have new facts in this case."Wiechers also said the Constitutional Court may hear the case if the Supreme Court of Appeal rejects a similar request from the NPA for leave to appeal.What this means for the case itself, Wiechers added, was that the judgment of the High Court in Pretoria stands.DA federal executive chairperson James Selfe said on Friday that the application highlighted the "deliberate attempts" by the NPA and Zuma to do everything possible to delay the president having his day in court.- Read more: Concourt refuses to hear NPA appeal on Zuma corruption charges - DANPA spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku told News24 on Friday that it was the first he heard of the order.Presidency spokesperson Dr Bongani Ngqulunga was not immediately available for comment.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
