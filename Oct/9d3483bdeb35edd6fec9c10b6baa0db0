This action in itself offers grounds for dismissal. It is regrettable that the SABC chose to ignore the technical controller's behaviour while it should have investigated the matter properly," he said.Evidence given by Van den Berg, including two polygraph tests, was not even considered, the union alleged, and following numerous meetings, no agreement could be reached, resulting in them approaching the courts."Van den Berg gave all the relevant information showing that he is not in the wrong," Kruger said.The sports broadcaster, who has been on the air for the past 34 years, has been out of work since May.In an email sent to the union in October by a "group employee relations consultant," the public broadcaster said the move was "properly made on the basis of the material that was before management at the time of decision making"."We record that the SABC does not have a procedure to review and set aside the decision to terminate the independent contract agreement. Consequently, the SABC is unable to revive the independent contractor's agreement," the email reads.SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago could not immediately be reached for comment. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
