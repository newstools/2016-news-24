	     Cape Town – An email claiming to be from the Cape Peninsula University of Technology is trying to lure students into giving their bank account details so that money can be deposited into them. The email, seen by News24 on Wednesday, is sent from a Gmail account. Presumably within the context of student protests across the country, it invites students to read an attached document and give suggestions on the stated issues. It also asks recipients to fill in a 2016 support form and specify account details. "Please specify your account details to enable us make payment," its reads. The email is signed "Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Groote Schuur Drive, Cape Town". University spokesperson Lauren Kansley told News24 it was the first she had heard of the email. She confirmed it was not authentic and that their IT team was investigating. Students were advised not to click on the link.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
