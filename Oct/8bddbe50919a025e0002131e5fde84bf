I don't know what they are clinging to. If they come here on whose mandate will they appear?"The Democratic Alliance, meanwhile, recently filed papers in the Western Cape High Court to have Motsoeneng's appointment as group executive of corporate affairs declared invalid.Motsoeneng was the former SABC chief operating officer.In its application, the party wants to prevent Motsoeneng from serving in any senior position at the SABC, unless the Public Protector's findings about his conduct and character were reviewed and set aside.On September 19, the Supreme Court of Appeal rejected Motsoeneng's bid to appeal the Western Cape High Court's November 2015 ruling declaring his appointment irrational and setting it aside.Public Protector Thuli Madonsela found in a report released in February 2014 that Motsoeneng had lied about his qualifications when he applied for the post of chief operations officer, that he hiked his salary from R1.5m to R2.4m in one year, and that he purged senior staff.Despite these adverse findings, the SABC announced on September 27 that Motsoeneng would be appointed to the corporate affairs post.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
