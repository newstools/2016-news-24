At that time, when she was just seven or eight years old, she had appeared in an online video by Pierre Vogel - a notorious Salafist preacher in Germany.But it was only in November 2015 that she pledged allegiance to the ISIS, investigators said.Her brother had also sought to join the jihadist group in Syria but was arrested and jailed in Turkey, according to news agency DPA.Meanwhile on Thursday, a Syrian man went on trial in the southwestern city of Stuttgart accused of being among jihadists who kidnapped a UN peacekeeper in Damascus in 2013 in what prosecutors call a "war crime".The 25-year-old accused, named only as Suliman A-S, is believed to be a member of a branch of the Al-Nusra Front jihadist group.He allegedly participated in the abduction on February 17, 2013 and was "involved in guarding the kidnapped victim between March and June 2013".Jihadist attacksHe is "suspected of an attack during Syria's civil war against a person, who was involved in a peacekeeping mission under the United Nations Charter, and was therefore entitled to protection," the federal prosecutor's office said when he was arrested in January.A verdict is not expected before April 2017. Germany has so far been spared large-scale jihadist attacks.But Europe's biggest economic power has been shaken by two assaults claimed by the ISIS and carried out by Syrian asylum seekers - an axe rampage on a train in Wuerzburg that injured five, and a suicide bombing in Ansbach in which 15 people were hurt. Police last week said they had foiled an alleged plot by a Syrian refugee to bomb one of Berlin's airports.The cases have fuelled anxiety over Germany's record influx of nearly 900 000 refugees and migrants in 2015.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
