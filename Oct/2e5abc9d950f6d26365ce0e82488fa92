Too many of us have been silent," he said.While he was talking, a small group of students in the back of the church disrupted him. There were complaints that the venue was too small. They demanded that the talks be held at Solomon Mahlangu (Senate) House on Wits University&rsquo;s East campus.Those in attendance included Max Sisulu, Nelson Mandela Foundation CEO Sello Hatang, and Bishop Malusi Mpumlwana.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
