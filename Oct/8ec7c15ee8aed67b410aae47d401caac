We also had disturbances in the library," he said."In Pietermaritzburg a group of protesters were involved in action outside the Indumiso campus."He added that the situation compromised the safety of students and staff."We realise that this stop-start scenario is not ideal. We are also well aware that the exam season is around the corner. I did meet with our SRC this morning and we have made progress with regard to their concerns. We will issue another update this evening," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
