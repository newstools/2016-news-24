It was purely on that basis."When asked if the issue of charging Gordhan came up during the meeting, Masutha said the matter had already been communicated to him well before that day.The Sunday Times reported&nbsp;this weekend&nbsp;that Abrahams met President Jacob Zuma and three ministers at the ANC&rsquo;s headquarters, on Monday, October 10, the day before he announced the decision to charge Gordhan with fraud.The other two ministers were State Security minister David Mahlobo and Minister of Social Development Bathibile Dlamini.Abrahams&nbsp;too said the meeting had nothing to do with Gordhan, and was there at Masutha&rsquo;s request to discuss protests at universities.Constitutional law expert Pierre De Vos argued on Twitter on Monday that Abrahams had no business visiting the ANC&rsquo;s offices for a meeting, as it created perceptions of bias and political interference.De Vos tweeted that the National Director of Public Prosecutions should be independent and not holding discussions about political issues, including student protests, with the president or any minister.&ldquo;Abrahams had no business being at that meeting, either to discuss student protests or to discuss the charging of Gordhan,&rdquo; he said.De Vos raised concerns that Abrahams did not deny discussing the charging of Gordhan at the meeting. This was despite comment from NPA spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku, who told the Sunday Times that Gordhan was not the subject of the meeting.&ldquo;You can discuss something at a meeting, even when that is not the subject of the meeting,&rdquo; said De Vos. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
