Thuli Madonsela said her office investigated three specific allegations for the report.WATCH Outgoing Thuli Madonsela has started her final press briefing as incumbent Public Protector at her offices in Pretoria. Meanwhile, President Jacob Zuma and Local Government Minister Des Van Rooyen’s applications to interdict the Public Protector’s "state capture" report will be heard on November 1. This meant that Thuli Madonsela would not release the interim report on Friday. She would, however, still brief the media about her other reports. Van Rooyen's interdict hearing would merge with a separate bid by Zuma and be heard in the High Court in Pretoria on November 1. The EFF, UDM and Cope were opposing this and would ask the court for an order to preserve the report. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
