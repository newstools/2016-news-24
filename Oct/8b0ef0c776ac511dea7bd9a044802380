He said millions of people could not "survive without external assistance".The conflict in Yemen escalated when Houthi rebels took control of the capital and much of the northern region, prompting a Saudi-led coalition to intervene in March last year to restore the internationally-recognised government of Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
