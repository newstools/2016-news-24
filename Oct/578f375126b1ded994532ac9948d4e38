However, the trend of upward temperatures remains clear, with the year so far, from January to September, still the most scorching since 1880, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said in its monthly climate report. "September 2016 was the second highest for the month of September in the NOAA global temperature dataset record," said the report. "This ends the longest streak in the 137-year record of 16 consecutive months to reach a new monthly high global temperature." September did not miss the record by much - it was just 0.38 Celsius cooler than the record warmth of September 2015 when the Pacific warming trend of El Nino was strengthening. El Nino came to an end in July, and scientists expected a minor cooldown would follow. Still, the pattern of increasing temperatures remains evident, as fossil fuel burning contributes to the rise of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
