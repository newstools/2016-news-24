No hits were reported.Later, US officials said the initial reports as described by Admiral John Richardson, the top Navy officer, were being reassessed, and they declined to provide full details of what happened.If confirmed, the missile launches would be the third attack in about a week targeting the destroyer USS Mason and other US ships."The Mason once again appears to have come under attack in the Red Sea, again from coastal defence cruise missiles fired from the coast of Yemen," Richardson, the chief of naval operations, told reporters Saturday in Baltimore.Just two days earlier, a US warship fired Tomahawk missiles into Yemen to destroy three radar sites that Pentagon leaders believed played a role in the earlier attacks.A senior US defence official said the Mason was in international waters when multiple incoming surface-to-surface missiles were reported by the ship's crew to have been detected about 15:30 EDT. The Mason was not struck and no crew were hurt.A US official said that additional radars could have been used in Saturday's reported attack.The officials were not authorised to discuss the incident publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
