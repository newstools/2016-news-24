He said there was also an effort to recruit and retain foreign doctors.Junoir doctors and interns in KZN are particularly worried about how the Fees Must Fall movement may affect next year&rsquo;s graduates.A Durban doctor said juniors were the first to assess patients and see to emergencies. With second-year doctors leaving to complete their community service, the gap left by the previous interns may not be filled.&ldquo;[If this academic year is not completed] there will be around 1 200 medical students who will not graduate and will not be placed in internship positions.&ldquo;Even if one university does not graduate, there will be around 300 graduates who will not be placed.&rdquo;A Pietermaritzburg doctor said there was concern that doctors leaving to perform their community service might be stopped if universities did not complete their 2016 academic years.A statement by the South African Medical Association (Sama) also expressed &ldquo;deep concern&rdquo; over the impact of the protests. &ldquo;Interns and junior doctors are the bedrock on which the public healthcare system is based, and any disruption to their production will have dire consequences,&rdquo; said the statement.Sama chairperson Dr Mzukisi Grootboom said the public healthcare system was &ldquo;under immense strain&rdquo; and dependent on new graduates entering the system. &ldquo;Jeopardising this new intake will seriously impede healthcare delivery, and will ultimately have a knock-on effect on patient morbidity and even mortality,&rdquo; he said. &mdash; WWR.Interns and junior doctor sometimes have to work shifts of up to 32 hours, said a source.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
