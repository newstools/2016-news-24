Burundi's president wants free hands to attack civilians."He added that former South African president Nelson Mandela had "promoted the establishment of the Court to avoid new massive crimes in Africa. Now under the Zuma leadership South Africa decided to cover up the crimes and abandoned African victims. The world is going backward"."The chaos is coming. Genocide in Burundi and a new African war are in motion. South Africa's move is showing political protection for Burundi," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
