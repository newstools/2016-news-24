He has called for renewed war with the SPLA forces of President Salva Kiir."On the SPLA side, they do entertain the idea that they could achieve a military victory, so the political process comes second," a senior UN official said.South Sudan descended into war in December 2013 after Kiir accused his former deputy Machar of plotting a coup.Tens of thousands of people have died and more than 2.5 million have been driven from their homes in the nearly three-year war, which has been marked by appalling levels of rape and killings.The UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said in a letter to the council last week that Kiir's government was imposing "significant limitations" to the proposed new force.Ethiopia, Kenya and Rwanda have offered to contribute troops, but the Juba government has yet to give its approval for the makeup of the force, which will be under the command of the UN mission in South Sudan.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
