Worried about all the dairy + cauliflower = wind for babies?? [sic]"Noakes advised her to wean her child onto LCHF foods, which he described as "real" foods.His tweet read: "Baby doesn't eat the dairy and cauliflower. Just very healthy high-fat breast milk. Key is to ween [sic] baby onto LCHF."Process 'undermined'He recently testified during his hearing and called international witnesses in defence of his case.The matter was adjourned this week for argument in April 2017.Pike said he and his team do not doubt the honour of the members of the committee, but that the HPCSA had "undermined the entire process"."It makes us ask if someone within the HPCSA bureaucracy had already come to a conclusion."Upon the conclusion of Noakes' witnesses testimony on Wednesday, there was a congenial atmosphere in the hearing venue, Pike said."Everyone shook hands, knowing that they had done the best that they could."Committee to deliberateHe said his team had received messages of surprise, from as far as Colorado in the US, that Noakes had seemingly been found guilty.The pro forma complainant would have until February 1 next year to file heads of argument. Noakes' legal team would have until February 22 next year to do the same. The pro forma complainant would then have until March 15 to file a reply to these heads.The committee would deliberate on the issue and come to a decision between April 6 and 7 next year, the HPCSA said.Judgment on the matter would be issued on April 21.Noakes had argued during the hearing that his advice was anything but unconventional, quoting research from as far back as the 1800s, before the boom in obesity rates.He said the HPCSA had treated him unfairly and not given him the opportunity to defend himself in a preliminary trial.He maintained throughout his hearing that there was nothing dangerous about the LCHF lifestyle.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
