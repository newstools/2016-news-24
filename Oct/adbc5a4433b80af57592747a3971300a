"Rest, martyr Mouhcine. We will carry on the struggle!"Another protester demanded a proper investigation into the incident to "find those who did it".The exact circumstances of Fikri's death remain unclear.But a human rights activist told AFP that the authorities forced the fishmonger to destroy several boxes of swordfish, whose fishing is banned."The goods were worth a lot of money," said Fassal Aoussar from the local branch of the Moroccan Association of Human Rights.Police harassment&nbsp;"The salesman threw himself in after his fish and was crushed by the machine," he said."The whole of the Rif is in shock and boiling over."The interior ministry and prosecutors in Al-Hoceima have ordered an investigation into the incident.King Mohammed VI has ordered a "thorough and exhaustive investigation" into the incident and the "prosecution of whoever is found responsible", an interior ministry statement said.The king - who was in Zanzibar on a tour of East Africa - sent Interior Minister Mohammed Hassad to "present his condolences" to Fikri's family, it said.It was the self-immolation of a street vendor in Tunisia in late 2010 in protest at police harassment that sparked Tunisia's revolution and the Arab Spring uprisings across the rest of the region the next year.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
