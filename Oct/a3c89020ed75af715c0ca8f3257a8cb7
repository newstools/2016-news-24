Police divers on Sunday resumed their search for the 29-year-old man who was last seen shortly after midday on Saturday. Spokesperson Captain Malcolm Pojie said the trainee's body had not yet been found. The National Sea Rescue Institute's Wilderness station commander, Robert van Heldsingen, said the Oudtshoorn Police Academy had requested assistance and its rescue vehicle and swimmers, along with provincial government emergency services, an ER24 ambulance and a Skymed rescue helicopter responded. "An extensive sea, air and shoreline search commenced for [the man], believed to be from Gauteng," he said. It is understood that a group of men had been on the rocks on the shoreline when the trainee was swept off by a wave. "According to reports a friend went into the surf to try to rescue him. The friend managed to get safely back to the shore after losing sight of the victim. Despite an extensive search no sign of the missing man has been found." Police divers continued the search. Van Heldsingen said it was suspected that the New Moon Spring Tide and large sea swells in the area of the Southern Cape coastline on Saturday may have contributed to the tragedy.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
