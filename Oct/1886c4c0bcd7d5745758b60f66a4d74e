In fact, Adv Madonsela declared that the report is final, and not subject to any further amendments."Returning a report that is already finished and signed-off by the Office of the Public Protector simply doesn't make any sense."Tabling the full letter would allow MPs to make sure that Madonsela's request was fully adhered to."This is vital for the proper and effective functioning of the institution. We desperately require a working Parliament which acts as the apex of accountability."The letter should be made public without delay, the DA said.Parliament on Monday said the report would be delivered to new Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, who officially started her job on Monday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
