He speaks their language Tamasheq fluently as well as Fula and Arabic.Jeff, as they call him, could be seen around town in a turban, leather sandals and a big boubou - a flowing African tunic."He was with us through all the hardest times", said Abalak's mayor Ahmed Dilou - the times of a food crisis, the droughts, the floods.The Friday night of Jeff's abduction "was such a devastating shock that the whole city cried", he said.Jeff 'wasn't afraid'&nbsp;But apparently Woodke was not concerned about living in this unstable Tahoua region of Niger, close to the borders of Mali and Algeria. Western embassies have issued strong warnings to their nationals against venturing there.A Nigerien official said he had "tried everything" to convince the American to leave the area but "he refused, insisting that he was not afraid".Investigators have sealed off Woodke's house. In the courtyard shaded by thorn trees, some bricks can be seen piled up next to sacks of cement. "He was rebuilding a wall that had collapsed after some heavy rains," explained Aicha.Still, despite Woodke's popularity with the townspeople, a regional lawmaker said he believed the kidnappers "were helped by some locals".According to Interior Minister Mohamed Bazoum, who visited Abalak, around 350km northeast of the capital Niamey, the kidnappers "went straight to his home, guided by a motorcyclist".'Kidnapping of Jeff is wrong'Last Sunday Bazoum said that Woodke - the first American abducted in the west African country - "was probably kidnapped by the Mujao or handed over to the Mujao"."We have had no contact with the Mujao, which is a terrorist organisation," he added.Niger's long, porous borders make it occasionally vulnerable to the armed violence in neighbouring countries.No matter who is responsible, in Abalak, the mayor - speaking for the distressed people of his city - is categorical in his condemnation."The kidnapping of Jeff is wrong," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
