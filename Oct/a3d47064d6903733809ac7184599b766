The Youth League called for him to be disciplined by the ruling party.&nbsp; The Youth League on Saturday reaffirmed their resolve that law enforcement agencies look into the Manuel complaint urgently.&nbsp; "It would appear that from Trevor Manuel's comments, he has a lot to answer for."Manuel on Friday said the Hawks must bring it on when talking about the possibility of charges against him. He was speaking at a business breakfast hosted by the Ubuntu Foundation, MMI Holdings and the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung in Cape Town on Friday. "I am comfortable that there has been no wrongdoing.
