WSAW-TV reports that investigators say the Monday night conservation group meeting in Amherst had nothing to do with politics. Authorities say the 32-year-old woman was drunk when she entered the meeting and began yelling about how she hates Trump. She departed when asked to leave, but authorities say she then used peanut butter to draw phallic symbols and write profanities on vehicles outside. An incident report said the woman's blood-alcohol content was 0.218, about 2½ times the state's legal limit for driving. She is free on bond. Amherst is 185km north of Madison.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
