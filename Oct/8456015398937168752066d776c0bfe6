Ho Van Loc, deputy director of labor department in Dong Nai province, said the breakout on Sunday was started by two inmates and eventually 562 inmates escaped. Police have so far recaptured 332 of them and are searching for the others, he said. The centre holds 1 481 inmates. Officials have said that rehabilitation programs in Vietnam - which combine education, communist ideology and physical labour for one to two years - have a high failure rate, with more than 90% of the addicts relapsing within five years. There are an estimated 200 000 drug addicts in Vietnam, many of them heroin users. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
