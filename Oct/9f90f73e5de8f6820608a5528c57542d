I am still in absolute disbelief that we actually managed to find her after a year,&rdquo; said an emotional Celeste van Wyk after a fairytale reunion with her dog.Van Wyk said Lady had been missing for over a year and she is extremely glad she is finally back home &ldquo;where she belongs&rdquo;.Van Wyk told The Witness that one year ago she tried to rehome Lady, but the pet escaped from her new home.&ldquo;The people who took her contacted me the next morning to tell me that she had dug a hole under the fence and they [thought] she may have gone into the forest at Blackridge.'Heartbroken'&ldquo;I was heartbroken as I did not really want to give her away. We were struggling a little financially and wanted her to go to a good home,&rdquo; explained Van Wyk.&ldquo;I searched for months [following her disappearance] but to no avail,&rdquo; she said.She said on October 10 this year while scrolling through Facebook she came across a page called Lost, Found &amp; Adopt &mdash; Midlands, KZN and to her surprise, she saw a picture of Lady.&ldquo;I was 100% sure it was her.&ldquo;I managed to get into contact with the woman who found her,&rdquo; she said.She said the woman who found Lady was walking her own dogs at the edge of the forest close to Liberty Midlands Mall when she found Lady.&ldquo;The woman took Lady home and she bathed and fed her and then took her to the SPCA.&ldquo;I am so thankful to her and can never express my gratitude enough,&rdquo; said Van Wyk.Van Wyk said she went to the SPCA to see Lady and confirmed that it was definitely her and that she wanted to &ldquo;adopt&rdquo; her and take her home.&ldquo;She has lost a lot of weight. Her condition is sad and her coat has also changed colour due to stress,&rdquo; said van Wyk.'Fairytale'After going through the SPCA&rsquo;s process of adoption, Van Wyk was finally able to fetch Lady and take her back home.She is now back home with her family and Van Wyk&rsquo;s 10 other dogs.&ldquo;It is still unbelievable that Lady is finally back at home with us again. She is happy and very protective of us.&ldquo;I believe that this is what fairytales are actually made of because you never hear of stories where people are reunited with their pets after such a long time,&rdquo; said Van Wyk.She added that she is very grateful to the SPCA&rsquo;s staff and how professionally they handled the matter.&ldquo;I am hoping with a lot of love and care and the correct diet we can get her back to good health,&rdquo; added Van Wyk.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
