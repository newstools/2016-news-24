The International Energy Agency estimates the Forcados closure lost Nigeria $1bn in just three months.In a statement, the Avengers said they "took down" Chevron's 100 000-barrel-a-day offshore pipeline at Escravos in a pre-dawn attack on Tuesday. That breaks a three-month cease-fire days before President Muhammadu Buhari is expected to meet with community leaders and other stakeholders in the southern oil-producing region.The Avengers said peace talks are not progressing and warned the government should not use a proposed dialogue as "a distraction."Multiple, sophisticated attacks since February cut about a million barrels daily from Nigerian crude oil exports estimated at 2.2 million barrels a day and lost the country its position as Africa's biggest oil exporter.Some suggest the militants may be backed by politicians from the mainly Christian south who want to sabotage Buhari, a Muslim northerner who beat an incumbent southerner in 2015 elections.The president has initiated a dialogue and deployed troops who have killed an unknown number of militants and lost several soldiers. Buhari also reinstated allowances paid to former militants under a 2009 amnesty.The Avengers have said they want to force multinationals out of the oil-producing Niger Delta because careless production has impoverished residents through massive pollution that has destroyed fishing grounds and agricultural fields. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
