At least 3 000 people died and Gbagbo is now on trial in The Hague for war crimes and crimes against humanity.But the opposition has called for a constitutional convention and objects to giving Ouattara the power to name a vice president, "in reality to choose his successor".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
