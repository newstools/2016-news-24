Vusi.MthalaneWHAT kind of a country will South Africa be in 20 to 35 years time? From where I am, things look gloomy. We live in a country where the average state employee is haughty, possesses a false sense of entitlement, has a poor work ethic, yet feels and believes that it his or her right to earn (read: steal) a monthly salary and an undeserved annual performance bonus from the state. This is recipe for disaster. This is not how things are done. On top of that, the general public exhibits similar characteristics as the average state employee, refuses to pay its utility bills, dodges paying taxes, yet feels it is its right to get things free from the state. The state is not Father Christmas. It pains me, I love this country. I work in the public sector and it beats my understanding and reasoning why the average state employee behaves in this manner. We have children growing up today, our future leaders, what are we teaching them? They are surely learning all these alien and/or deviant behaviours from us, surely. And how do you live with yourself earning a salary that you know full well you don t deserve? I leave it here. DBK84 Umtentweni24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
