Now is the time to defend the revolution," Maine said. However, the ANC, in rejecting the comments made by Maine, said it hoped his remarks were never allowed the space to flourish."In a democratic SA, there is no room for the private army," said Kodwa.The party also reminded its youth league leader that Zuma was elected through a democratic process, insisting that he still enjoyed overwhelming support from members of the ANC and society.The league, in responding to the criticism, said its president would explain himself to officials in the ANC."There is an NWC [national working committee meeting] today [Monday]. He [Maine] will meet with officials to reflect on such. If the NWC deems it fit that he be more mindful of his comments, that's what he will do going forward," said league spokesperson Mlondi Mkhize.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
