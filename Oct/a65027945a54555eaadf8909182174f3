News24 Correspondent Harare - How about this for an image of how fake many Zimbabweans believe the about-to-be-introduced bond notes will be?With a claim on Thursday by the independent Financial Gazette online that the much-feared new bank notes will now not be brought in until early November, Zimbabweans have been spreading a borrowed internet meme to show that they have absolutely no faith in central bank chief John Mangudya's new project.The meme shows a heap of tomato (or is it chilli?)-sauce laced rice on a plate. Where the chicken drumstick should be is a piece of torn-off exercise paper with a joint hastily drawn on in blue pen.Many pics have added a caption: "Bond chicken. Nothing is impossible in Zimbabwe."The meme - which appears to have been found on Spanish-language Pinterest sites - has been widely re-tweeted, shared and commented upon."This bond represents chicken held&hellip; at Irvines. It is just as good as the real thing!" quipped one Twitter user. Irvines is a leading chicken producer. Mangudya has based his argument for bond notes on the claim that they are backed by a $200m facility from the Afreximbank (there are still demands for him to provide proof of this). He says the note will be on a parity with the US dollar, Zimbabwe's main official currency since early 2009.&nbsp;Locals fear that it will swiftly be rejected by shops and traders and will drag Zimbabwe back to the dark pre-2009 days of hyperinflation and rampant shortages."Lunch is served #BondChicken," tweeted @ali_naka.@CdeMarcKatsaura wrote: "Eating meat in #Zimbabwe today... let's do something about this please."Lunch is served #BondChicken pic.twitter.com/AKdMFcySRXEating meat in #Zimbabwe today #thiseconomy #ThisFlag #Twimbos #Tajamuka Cc @ZimPeopleFirst Lets do something about this please!! pic.twitter.com/LExEyuXRCn24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
