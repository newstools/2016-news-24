The murder trial of Christopher Panayiotou and two other accused has continued in the High Court in Port Elizabeth. Jump to bottom Chetty: Court is adjournedMS: I ask that we stand down till tomorrowMS: As you wish, my LordChetty: I will not allow the statementChetty: Perhaps I should look at the statement then&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS: I do have a copy available. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;TP: We have no objection, we think it is a good idea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stander hands it up.Chetty: What you are objecting to, is the statement from the deceased accusedPD: Yes my lordPD: If there is any chance of prejudice, then it should not be submittedPD: This is a red herring. He somehow wants to use this evidence against the other accused as he wants to use it against them&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose for which he wishes to use the evidence is irrelevant.Peter Daubermann, for Nenembe and Sibeko, rises. Can I ask that the content of the statement be placed before the court?TP: It is too dangerous Court needs to consider it carefully.TP: You can say what you like, whatever Stander says, this is a confessionTP: There isn't anything that shows that this led to the investigation went anywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It certainly paints a picture, looking at the allegation of common purpose.TP: This is another attempt to patently submit evidence before the court that is inadmissableTP: I have it on good authority that, had Vumazonke been here, his attorney would have challenged this, and would have challenegd that he had ever been there.Judge Chetty: Mr Price, given the circumscribed nature of this what are your objections.MS: It is therefore that the argument that it will attract prejudice is extremely thing. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I request the court to allow that evidence&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that is only pertaining to this witness in twofold: Once to when he spoke to her in the house and secondly when she asked him about the laptop bag and books.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are my submissionsMS: As indicated previously this does not go to any of the accused before court. I can give the court an undertaking that there is no way that this witness in the witness box is going to make an allegation against anyone in the dock.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore there can be no prejudice against Accused 1, 3 or 4.MS: However, in this case, the probative evidence relies solely on the evidence presented by this witness to the police.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And therefore I request the court to allow the hearsay evidence as it will be in the interest of justice.MS: More specifically it was used to corroborate evidence to implicate the accused before court&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS: And that is not the case in this specific scenarioIn most cases where hearsay evidence has been excluded it is where the State has tried to lead hearsay evidence to corroborate other elements in the State's case.MS: The State does not even intend to rely or even to ask the court to make a finding on the matter as to whether the words from Vumazonke is, in fact, the truth. The state wants to lead this evidence in order to show the chain of events that started from there.MS: At this stage, I wish to bring an application in terms of section 3 of the hearsay act, in the hearsay evidence to hear Sizwezhake s words&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS: I know that it is hearsay evidence, and hearsay is inadmissble but section 3 does allow for the certain circumstances whereby hearsay can be heardMS: The nature of the evidence will not have any direct implication on the accused before the courtMS: And the police took a statement from you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ZZ: Yes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS: Did the police ask you to do something?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ZZ: They left their telephone number with me and asked me to give them a call if he arrives thereZZ: I phoned his sister, but I could not get hold of them on the phone. Their phone was on voicemail and I was unable to get hold of them. I then phoned my cousin cause she was not feeling well&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS: And you told her what happened&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ZZ: YesZZ: I went inside the house. I asked him, what bag is this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS: You don't have to tell me what he answered&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS: Did the bag stay there &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ZZ: When I asked him about the bag, he took bag, put it over his shoulder and leftZZ: I went outside the house to a water tap inside the yard to get water.
