The agency administers funds on behalf of the Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF).In the subpoena, Sukdev is asked to provide statistics of the approval of 3 000 applications for early retirement to the GEPF from various government employees who retired before they turned 60; five requests of staff members whose early retirement were approved by finance ministers between 2008 and 2010, and an affidavit "clarifying whether GEPF approves requests from various departments for staff members who retire before the age of 60 with full benefits".Gordhan is accused of fraudulently approving the payment of an early pension to Ivan Pillay, the former deputy head of the South African Revenue Service (Sars). As a result, Sars had to pay a penalty of R1.2m.A public outcry ensued in the aftermath of Gordhan's charges being made public, with numerous commentators stating that it was a common practice for government employees to go on early retirement."Clearly, any evidence which spoke to the practices and lawfulness of early retirement of public servant with full pension had to be fully investigated and considered before charging (Gordhan)," states Antonie. Gordhan referred to these policies in his response to the Hawks.Ulterior purposesAccording to Antonie this proves the decision to charge Gordhan "clearly failed to consider the actual evidence pertinent to the charge". It appears that the NPA had "elected to ignore any facts which had the potential to corroborate the lawfulness of the conduct in question".This reinforces the submission that the charges against Gordhan were pursued for an ulterior purpose, Antonie states."That the prosecuting authorities are only now calling for the evidence and considering the applicable laws simply reinforces the unlawfulness of the charges and the abusive and precipitous manner in which they were pressed."Gordhan, Pillay and former Sars commissioner Oupa Magashula are scheduled to appear in the Pretoria Regional Court on November 2. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
