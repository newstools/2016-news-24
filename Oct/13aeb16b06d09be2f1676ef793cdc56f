This is a commercial issue and not political. It is normal for some shipments to be late," he said.Abdel Aziz did not elaborate on when he expected Aramco to resume shipments but insisted: "The deal with Saudi is ongoing."Saudi Arabia has provided Egypt with billions of dollars in aid and credit since Sisi overthrew Islamist president Mohamed Morsi when army chief in 2013 and King Salman visited Cairo in April.The two governments have had some differences over the Syrian conflict and over Egypt's unwillingness to send ground troops to join the Saudi-led coalition fighting rebels in Yemen.But Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United Nations, Abdullah al-Muallimi, expressed hurt at Saturday's UN vote by Egypt."It was painful for the Senegalese and Malaysian positions to be closer to the Arab consensus than that of the Arab representative," he told Al-Jazeera television."This obviously was painful. But obviously the question should be directed to Egypt's ambassador."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
