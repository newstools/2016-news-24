System CONVICTED rapist and murderer, Lindokuhle Mthethwa (22), was handed two life sentences at the Durban High Court last week. He was also given an additional five years for kidnapping and a further five years for housebreaking. Mthethwa raped and murdered five-year-old Velile Mngomezulu in July last year. The child was asleep in her room at home in Etete when the accused, who is also from the area, broken the door open and took the victim to a nearby bush. She was raped and thereafter [Mthethwa] realised that the victim might be able to identify him. He then banged the victim s head against the nearby rocks. The victim was later found and taken to a nearby hospital where she died due to her injuries, KZN SAPS spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said in a statement. A case of murder, rape, kidnapping and housebreaking was opened at the Umhlali police station for further investigation. Police, with the assistance of the community, traced and arrested the accused within 24 hours of the incident. He was charged accordingly with all counts and taken to court. Upon hearing about the conviction and sentencing, members of the community said while they were happy that justice was served, this does not bring back the young life that was taken. Rapists and murderers and all other criminals must be clear that we will find them and we will have justice, said one community member. KwaZulu-Natal acting provincial commissioner Major General Bhekinkosi Langa commended the good work displayed by Umhlali detectives who thoroughly investigated the case . The members presented enough evidence to court that led to a harsh sentenced to the accused. I also thank the community for their role in making sure that the accused was brought to court immediately after he committed the crimes, he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
