It argues that hundreds of millions of euros it has contributed to development aid since Namibia's independence from South Africa in 1990 was for the benefit of all Namibians.Leaders of both Namibian indigenous groups said they would not accept any apology not backed by reparations..This is because it "would seriously constitute a phenomenal insult to the intelligence not only of the Namibians and the descendents of the victim communities but to Africans in general," said Vekuii Rukoro, the paramount chief of the Herero people."It would represent the most insensitive political statement ever to have been made by an aggressor nation to the victims of its genocide," he added.Scientific experiments&nbsp;Germany had not only apologised to the Jews for the Holocaust, but had also paid reparations, Rukoro said."Because we have a different skin colour, the German government is saying to us: it's only an apology and that's it," he said, adding that the "rest will be cheque-book diplomacy through our government, which will be given development assistance, and then we must shut up.""Guess what? The Hereros and Namas of Namibia, victims of genocide, we will not ever, in another 100 years to come, accept that," he stressed. Berlin ruled what was then called South-West Africa as a colony from 1884 to 1915.Incensed by German settlers stealing their land and cattle and taking their women, the Herero people launched a revolt in January 1904 with warriors killing 123 German civilians over several days. The Nama tribe joined the uprising in 1905.The colonial rulers responded ruthlessly and General Lothar von Trotha signed a notorious extermination order against the Hereros.Rounded up in prison camps, captured Namas and Hereros died from malnutrition and severe weather. Dozens were beheaded after their deaths and their skulls sent to German researchers in Berlin for "scientific" experiments.Up to 80 000 Hereros lived in Namibia when the uprising began. Afterwards, only 15 000 were left.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
