North West – A total of 360 title deeds have been handed over to disadvantaged communities in Groot Marico, the North West Department of Local Government and Human Settlements said on Saturday. "There is nothing more empowering than owning an asset. These beneficiaries now have proof of ownership of their house, which is the necessary evidence for them to be able to leverage this asset," MEC Galaletsang Gaolaolwe said in a statement.  The deeds were handed over to residents of Bokone Bophirim. One of the beneficiaries, Ester Khethene, aged 50, told the department that she was very happy. "I really never thought that one day I will have this title deed," she was quoted as saying.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
