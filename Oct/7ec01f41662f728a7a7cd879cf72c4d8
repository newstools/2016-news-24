Saca held office from 2004 to 2009 for the rightist Nationalist Republican Alliance. Police said on Saturday that six former officials in his government were also arrested. Prosecutors say Saca has not clarified the origins of $5m of the $6.5m in assets he acquired during his time in office. Saca is a former radio sports announcer. He declared his fortune at $3.6m when he took office. Five years later, it had grown to $13.1m. Former President Mauricio Funes, who succeeded Saca, is also under investigation for corruption, as is former president Francisco Flores. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
