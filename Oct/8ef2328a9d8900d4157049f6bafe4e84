Since then, he has appeared in court in shackles and with a stun belt strapped around him.He still faces trial on a charge of killing businessman Sam Issa.Bryer said he had a signed mandate to negotiate on Krejcir&rsquo;s behalf for extradition, but was not so sure if he was Krejcir's lawyer anymore.He said that at a recent court appearance, there was a suggestion that Krejcir be sent for psychiatric observation. During this, Krejcir said he no longer had a lawyer. Bryer said he had not been informed that his services had been terminated.According to a post on a Facebook account purporting to be run on Krejcir's behalf, he distanced himself from the offer to turn State witness.According to the post, Krejcir had no input in drafting the letter and any names mentioned in it had nothing to do with him.He would like to be extradited though, because he believed he would not get a fair trial in South Africa.The National Prosecuting Authority&rsquo;s Gauteng spokesperson, Phindi Louw, did not want to comment.Forensic investigator Paul O'Sullivan and two police officers were blamed in the post, supposedly made by Krejcir's family.An irritated O'Sullivan said he did not have time to find out who posted the accusation, but that he had nothing to do with Bryer drawing up the letter to the NPA.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
