Angelique Serrao, News24Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan (Netwerk24) Multimedia &nbsp; &nbsp; User Galleries &nbsp; &nbsp; News in Pictures Send us your pictures &nbsp; &nbsp; Send us your stories Pretoria - Speculation is rife that the National Prosecuting Authority will on Monday either drop the charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan or add more charges linked to the so called &ldquo;rogue unit&rdquo; at SARS.The National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams indicated that he will be holding an &ldquo;impromptu&rdquo; press conference today in Silverton, at 10:30 on Monday.News24 has learnt that Gordhan, former SARS Commissioner Oupa Magashula and Deputy Commissioner Ivan Pillay and their legal teams have not had any indication the NPA that the charges against them will be dropped.Gordhan&rsquo;s lawyer Tebogo Malatji said they have had no communication from the NPA and he had no idea what the press conference could be about.A legal expert told News24 that if the NPA wants to withdraw the charges they would not do it outright.&lsquo;Rogue unit&rsquo; chargesREAD: Is Pravin off the hook?Instead they would indicate that because of the representations they received from Magashula and Pillay, they were made aware of new information which means they need to investigate the charges further. This would allow them a more graceful exit if they want to withdraw the charges.Other sources close to the case, believe however that more charges could be added to the charge of fraud and theft already laid against Gordhan, Pillay and Magashula for Pillay&rsquo;s early retirement and contract reemployment.These would relate to the formation of a so called Rogue unit at SARS. If these charges are added, then more former SARS officials will probably be charged along with Gordhan.&ldquo;He [Abrahams] has chosen a path from which there is no return. It&rsquo;s scorched earth now,&rdquo; said one source.On Sunday, City Press reported that informal discussions between the NPA and the accused lawyers were under way to drop the charges against them.The paper said a draft letter was compiled by Abrahams&rsquo; office, communicating his intention to drop the charges.The letter will be sent before they appear in court on Wednesday, City Press said.In the letter, Abrahams allegedly writes that he has considered the representations made by Magashula and Pillay, and has decided to decline to prosecute them and Gordhan.Kidnapping and assaultREAD: Claims Abrahams dropping Gordhan charges 'absolute hogwash' - NPAGordhan, who was charged with fraud after signing off his approval of Pillay&rsquo;s early retirement in 2009, refused to make representations to Abrahams.At the time, his lawyer Tebogo Malatji said it was because &ldquo;he does not have any confidence in [Abrahams&rsquo;] ability or willingness to afford him a fair hearing&rdquo;.Thousands of Gordhan supporters are expected to march to the Pretoria Regional Court, where the case is set to be heard on Wednesday as part of Save SA, a civil society campaign calling for President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s resignation and backing the beleaguered minister.However, another reason for Abrahams&rsquo; impending decision to drop the charges - which is not included in the letters - was the alleged kidnapping and assault of SARS legal services official Vlok Symington, who prosecutors had hoped would testify in the case, City Press reported.City Press understood that Symington has been removed from the witness list, which prosecutors believe will hurt their case.Symington provided a legal opinion on Pillay&rsquo;s early retirement in March 2009.&ldquo;The developments that took place at SARS played a role in his [Abrahams&rsquo;] decision,&rdquo; said the senior NPA official on Sunday, referring to the events of October 18, when a copy of an email Symington received in error - which revealed SARS&rsquo; own lawyer disagreed with the case against Gordhan - was allegedly forced out of his hands in a scuffle.NPA spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku denied that a decision to decline to prosecute Gordhan and the others had been reached.&ldquo;We categorically deny your assertions. The NDPP is currently considering the matter and has not made a decision,&rdquo; he said, adding: &ldquo;The NDPP will make an announcement very soon," he told the City Press.WATCH this video:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
