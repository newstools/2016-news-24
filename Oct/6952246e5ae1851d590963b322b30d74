Minister of police was taken to court, he never received support from him," Nzuza told News24 on Tuesday.Gordhan is facing a charge of fraud along with two former South African Revenue Service officials, Oupa Magashula and Ivan Pillay, in connection with an early retirement package signed off by Gordhan for Pillay in 2010.Stop drawing conspiraciesNzuza said he was worried about the double standards shown by many, including some in the ANC."Now the integrity committee and other people zoomed in, including the organisation, into Marius Fransman, they ended up having him set aside because he was charged with a case. Pravin [Gordhan] is charged and no one is saying he must step aside," said Nzuza.Several leaders in both business and the ANC &ndash; including Jackson Mthembu, Max Sisulu, Zweli Mkhize and Matthews Phosa &ndash; have come out in support of the finance minister.Fransman was found guilty of bringing the party into disrepute in July following claims of sexual assault by Louisa Wynand.Nzuza also rubbished concerns raised by many that Gordhan&rsquo;s legal woes were politically motivated."People must stop drawing conspiracies when there are none, where is the evidence? [If] it&rsquo;s politically motivated, provide proof," he said.Nzuza said Gordhan was not pursuing a position in the party&rsquo;s elective conference taking place in 2017, yet people seemed to be creating a perception that he is being targeted because of the battle to lead the party.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
