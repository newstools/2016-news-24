Monday' session comes after the UN-backed Libyan government's failure to win legitimacy — or to function at all — amid deep political fragmentation. They are joined by the head of a UN-brokered presidency council and designated Prime Minister Fayez Serraj and other diplomats. The ministerial meeting is designed to deal with economic and security issues facing the government. The UN-backed government has failed to win endorsement of the eastern-based, internationally-recognized parliament, which is a prerequisite to assume power. At the same time, Serraj is facing a challenge from a self-declared prime minister in Tripoli who is trying to establish control in the chaotic North African country. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
