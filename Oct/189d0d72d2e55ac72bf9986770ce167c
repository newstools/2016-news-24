The social fabric of our country is gone. Like all dictators, Lungu has silenced the media."President Lungu on Sunday shrugged off UPND complaints, saying: "I am accepted by Zambians and the world at large."Zambia is known for its relative stability but the election campaign was marked by clashes between supporters of Lungu's Patriotic Front (PF) and the UPND.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
