This is unprecedented, unwarranted and unfortunate. Parliament operates on the basis of rules and set processes and these were followed in this regard," it said in a statement.This after the minister lashed out at Speaker Baleka Mbete on Wednesday after he made a request for McBride to face a disciplinary inquiry.But his request fell away when the committee tasked with handling the matter said it had to be made a resolution in the National Assembly before it could take it up.READ: McBride to probe alleged dodgy dealings at IpidThe minister raised concerns that his request to Parliament to institute disciplinary action against McBride following September's Constitutional Court ruling that his suspension be declared invalid was not responded to timeously.The Constitutional Court ruled that its order be suspended for 30 days in order for the National Assembly and Nhleko to exercise their powers.That suspension expired on Tuesday."Why the letter of 7 September 2016, was only responded to on 11 October 2016, even though the sitting of the House rose on 15 September 2016?" Nhleko questioned on Thursday.Mbete noted the statement with concern, Parliament said on Friday."The Speaker will take this matter up with the leader of government business as a matter of urgency." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
