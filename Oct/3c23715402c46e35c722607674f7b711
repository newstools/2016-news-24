Police spokesperson Luba Samri says the driver sped into paramilitary border police forces near the West Bank town of Beit Ummar. Palestinian officials and media identified the alleged assailant as Khalid Ikhlayel, a 23-year-old university student. The attack was the latest in a year-long wave of violence. Palestinian attackers have killed 36 Israelis and two visiting Americans in stabbings, shootings and car rammings. At least 222 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in that period. Israel says most of the Palestinians killed were attackers. Palestinians and Israeli rights groups say Israeli forces have at times used excessive force and killed suspects who could have been arrested. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
