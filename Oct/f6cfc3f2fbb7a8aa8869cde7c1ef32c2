Let them reveal their sources and let them reveal what kind of evidence they have that I was working as a spy in China,&rdquo; she told News24.The DA was the only party in the National Assembly that opposed her nomination to take over from Thuli Madonsela when her term comes to an end on October 14. On September 7, the National Assembly voted overwhelmingly in favour of giving&nbsp;Mkhwebane the job. The Presidency announced on Thursday that President Jacob Zuma had appointed her for a term of seven years, starting on October 15.The DA had opposed her nomination, claiming she was working for the State Security Agency while employed as an immigration officer in China. Mkhwebane said she was working for home affairs at the time.It was reckless for the DA to make such claims without having credible information as it could harm relations between South Africa and China, she said.DA deputy shadow minister for justice and correctional services, Werner Horn, said they promised to protect their sources. &nbsp;&ldquo;We had specific agreement with sources that we will protect them. At this stage we will not violate that agreement because the public protector feels we should provide the proof,&rdquo; Horn told News24The party dared Mkhwebane to prove it wrong and do her job independently and impartially.Mkhwebane said she was ready to do the job without fear or favour. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
