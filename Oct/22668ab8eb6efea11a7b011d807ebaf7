We need to be able to secure and protect them," he said. Italian energy giant Eni in August announced the discovery of Zohr, the "largest ever" offshore natural gas field in the Mediterranean with a potential 850 billion cubic metres of gas in about 100km2."The cost of a Mistral is equivalent to one month's revenues from the Zohr gas field," Sisi said.Egypt's parliament in August passed a law on value added tax, one of the reforms promised in exchange for the IMF loan, to be set at 13% for 2016-17 and 14 percent for the following fiscal year.The VAT replaces a sales tax of 10 percent, although the government says about 50 services and products will be exempt, including bread.tgg/ah/dr24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
