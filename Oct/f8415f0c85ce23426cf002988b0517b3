received emailed threats of violence and authorities are working to figure out
who and what is behind them. At least
seven schools in Leipzig and two in Magdeburg received the emails on Monday.
Police in Saxony, where Leipzig is located, wrote on Twitter that the threats
reached schools in various parts of Germany. They said they "do not
currently believe (the threat) is serious but have initiated extensive measures". Officers
were sent to the schools, and students and teachers at some of them had to
remain in the buildings. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
