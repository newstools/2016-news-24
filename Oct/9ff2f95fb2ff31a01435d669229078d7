They believe their initiative will get support from ANC members."We believe that the overwhelming majority of ANC members who are committed to the real values of the ANC will understand this and give their support to any initiative that helps strengthen the movement, government, the role of parliament and the institutions of the state to ensure the necessary corrections take place, before it is too late," the statement reads.The group has also thrown their support behind Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, former Sars boss Oupa Magashula and former deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay."We strongly believe the charges are without foundation and clearly show a misuse of state agencies when the NPA and other agencies should be focusing on cases of corruption and the misuse of public funds."The group has urged members of the public and ANC stalwarts to show their support to the three when they appear at the Pretoria regional court on November 2. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
