The areas around several key roads have also been declared red zones.Foreign diplomats are forbidden from travelling more than 40km outside the capital, Addis Ababa, "for their own security"."This is a state of emergency and we expect repressive measures," a western diplomat told AFP on condition of anonymity on Monday.Curfew&nbsp;"But we also expect an opening of the political space for the opposition as stated by the president in front of the parliament. This is not what seem to be happening," the diplomat added.The measures include a 18:00 to 06:00 curfew around factories, farms and government institution, which have come under attack from protesters in recent weeks.Political parties are "banned from giving press statements that incite violence" and religious leaders are forbidden from making political statements.Security forces are banned from going on holiday or resigning their jobs.The measures also make it illegal to watch television stations set up by the diaspora such as Ethiopian Satellite television (ESAT) and the US-based Oromia Media Network (OMN).Criminal activity&nbsp;Posting links from these organisations' websites onto social media has also been declared a "criminal activity".Cellphone internet access has been cut for almost three weeks in most parts of the country, including the capital.The country's Oromo and Amhara communities - which together make up 60% of the population - have been protesting for nearly a year against marginalisation by a government largely made up of minority Tigrayans, which controls power and the economy.The latest surge in violence came after police fired tear gas at protesters attending an Oromo religious festival on October 2, sparking panic in a massive crowd and triggering a stampede that left over 50 dead.International rights groups estimate the government crackdown has left more than 500 dead.Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn promised last week to reform the electoral system and "open up political space".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
