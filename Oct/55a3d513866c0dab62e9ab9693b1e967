tiles, toppled store shelves and caused power outages on Friday afternoon, but
apparently caused no widespread damage. At least seven people were injured, one seriously. The
Japan Meteorological Agency said the 6.6-magnitude quake occurred in Tottori, a
prefecture on the Sea of Japan about 700 kilometres
west of Tokyo. The epicentre was at a
relatively shallow depth of 11 kilometres.
Shallow quakes potentially cause more damage, but Friday's damage appeared to
be mostly minor or localised. At least
two houses collapsed, and television footage showed roof tiles knocked loose,
wall fragments from a sake brewery fallen to the ground, and wine bottles and
food items scattered on a store floor. Japan's public broadcaster NHK said a
woman cooking in a restaurant was taken to a hospital after she was splashed
with oil. "It
shook quite violently and file cabinets fell down, but luckily nobody was injured
in this office," Koji Nakahara, a town hall official in coastal Hokuei,
told NHK by telephone. The
earthquake caused temporary blackouts at about 32 000 homes, according to Chubu
Electric Power Co, a regional utility. The
meteorological agency said there was no danger of a tsunami from the inland
temblor. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
