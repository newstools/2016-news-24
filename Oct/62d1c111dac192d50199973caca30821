The shutdown continues here [at the University of Pretoria] tomorrow," Morolane said.Earlier on Monday, several students were barred from entering the university's Hatfield campus to attend a dialogue with academics and management.While some managed to make their way in through designated entrances, others took their chances by attempting to climb over walls.A dialogue was subsequently held with affected parties who were present. Students of different races as well as academics took their turns voicing their opinions on the current shutdown at the institution as well as on the call for free, higher education.However, the meeting came to an end after a number of students raised their disappointment over the fact that the dialogue was continuing without the presence of the larger student body, which was still barred from entering the campus.Students left the amphitheatre, where the dialogue had been held, and marched towards the entrance on Prospect Road where other students were waiting amid heavy police presence. The group then staged a sit in on the corner of Festival and Burnett streets, where those who were at the dialogue relayed what had been discussed.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
