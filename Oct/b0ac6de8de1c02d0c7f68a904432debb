City Press&rsquo; sister newspaper, Rapport, has revealed that the last of these sessions&ndash; during which five players were each massaged by Lewis for half an hour &ndash; took place on March 23 at the Pullman Hotel in Auckland, a day before the Proteas were dramatically eliminated from the competition by the home team.The session cost the Proteas $525 (R5 300). Lewis (35) became famous in 2006 when she was arrested after running across the field in a tiny, pink bikini during a rugby match between the All Blacks and Ireland in Hamilton. Since then she&rsquo;s had scores of other run-ins with the law. Lewis used to be an exotic dancer with the stage name Sapphire and became New Zealand&rsquo;s first topless newsreader. In a 2010 interview with stuff.co.nz, Lewis said she had joined the sex industry two years earlier and that it was one of &ldquo;the best jobs in the world&rdquo;. Until recently she was advertising her services on the website newzealandgirls.co.nz for $2 000 per hour (for sex) and $7 000 for a whole night. The going rate for a weekend is &ldquo;only&rdquo; $10 000. On her Twitter profile, which teems with half-naked selfies in a variety of risque positions, Lewis refers to herself as follows: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been reported as being New Zealand&rsquo;s most high-profile sex worker. Truth be known, I just love sex.&rdquo;In March last year, during the World Cup, Lewis said on her Instagram profile she was looking into other career opportunities and she had recently become involved in sports massage. Julia Russell, the owner of Julia Russell Massage, confirmed to Rapport that Lewis was appointed as one of her therapists shortly before the World Cup, but said she was &ldquo;unaware&rdquo; of Lewis&rsquo; previous work as an escort. &ldquo;Yes, she did work with the South African team ... but we let her go shortly afterwards when we became aware of her history.&rdquo;Mohammed Moosajee, Proteas team manager, said the team was only informed of Lewis&rsquo; background after they had already been cut from the competition. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not unusual for us to use external therapists on tour. We didn&rsquo;t approach her [Lewis] ourselves and we definitely didn&rsquo;t insist on her assistance in particular. &ldquo;She was contracted to us by Julia Russell Massage and because that company has often been used by us in the past, as well as by other sports teams, we didn&rsquo;t think it was necessary to inquire about her.&rdquo; Lewis has had to put out more fires over the past few weeks over allegations that she was the mysterious brunette All Blacks rugby player Aaron Smith was caught with in a disabled toilet at Christchurch Airport &ndash; a day after a Rugby Championship test against the Springboks. Smith was suspended for the last test of the series in Durban by All Blacks coach Steve Hansen after cellphone videos of Smith leaving the cubicle with the woman emerged.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
