The insinuation [that legislature files were made to disappear] is unfounded and not true. It is not a custom of the legislature to engage in irregular expenditure as this is in contravention of FMMPLA and SCM policies," said Memela-Gamede.Last month, it was reported by local media that the legislature had, on at least two occasions, invited quotations from two companies, Luthando Nto General Trading and Ndende Investment, and on both occasions the contract was awarded to Luthando Nto General Trading.An insider in the legislature disclosed that both companies were owned by a married couple, Ntokozo Manyisa and Eddy Mabuza. The couple have declined to confirm or deny their relationship.Another allegation was that Manyisa was given preferential treatment as she was the biological daughter of secretary to the legislature Linda Mwale.Mwale has denied the allegation through a written statement, but Manyisa declined to confirm or deny any relationship with Mwale.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
