Mother and daughter, Olwen and Colette James, are the new managers as from 1 September. Besides selling second-hand items donated by the community, the shop is also a satellite station for those wishing to make financial donations to the organisation as well as a drop-off point for bags of dog and cat food. Proceeds from the sale of donated items go towards medical and food costs of the animals in the care of the SPCA at Athlone Park. Previous manager Nigel Eady retired due to ill health and the SPCA thanks him for all he has done to ensure the success of the shop. Clean out your cupboards and drop unwanted items off at the shop at Southern Cross Centre, Arbuthnot Street between 9am and 3pm during the week and from 9am until 12pm on Saturdays. Plastic packets are also needed and creative and active members of the community are invited to donate three hours of their time weekly to work at the shop. For more information, contact Sarah-Jane Bow on 031 904 2424/5. Residents are reminded to keep this number handy to also report animal cruelty. - Supplied. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
