From Tuesday November 1, Level 3 restrictions will be implemented to ensure dams supplying Cape Town are not drawn to dangerous levels.The corresponding tariff schedule will be introduced on December 1, to allow the public to adjust to the restrictions.&nbsp;They prohibit the use of hosepipes and sprinklers for watering gardens, washing or hosing down &nbsp;hard surfaces with drinking water, using drinkable water in ornamental water fountains or features, and filling portable play pools. Mayoral committee member for utility services, Ernest Sonnenberg, said changes to the bulk water distribution system could sporadically affect the clarity or taste of water in parts of the northern and central suburbs.&ldquo;These changes are required to conserve water in the Theewaterskloof Dam. In addition, water pressure will be reduced in the water distribution system in order to limit water leaks from underground pipes and faulty plumbing fittings. Residents are requested to please exercise patience as taps may flow more slowly,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Resultant flow changes in some of the water pipelines may temporarily cause cloudiness or a slight discolouration in the water. Residents with sensitive palates may also notice a slight change in the taste of their water, as it will now be coming from a mix of sources.&rdquo;Consumers from several parts of the metro may have noticed an earthy taste and odour to their drinking water, caused by low levels of the chemical compound Geosmin in dam waters.This is a naturally-occurring compound and is neither toxic nor harmful to health.&ldquo;Water quality is monitored continuously and all water supplied will be entirely safe for human consumption,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&ldquo;Residents and visitors are assured that the City is working proactively to manage available water resources and reduce the effects of Geosmin in the source waters, concentrations of which are anticipated to increase with lower dam levels and hot, windy conditions.&rdquo;&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
