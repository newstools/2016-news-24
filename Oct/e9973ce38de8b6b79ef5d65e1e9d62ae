Rescuers are still at work in Sucun village, in China's Zhejiang province, where 10 people were confirmed dead Tuesday night. Another 17 are still considered missing, even though it's been more than a week since strong rapids carrying rocks and debris swept through the village and destroyed 20 homes. Elsewhere in Zhejiang province, authorities in Wencheng county have confirmed the death of a sixth person. The landslides were triggered by Typhoon Megi, which lashed southeastern China and Taiwan last week with heavy rain and strong winds. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
