	     Cape Town - Protesters outside the UCT law faculty have accused security guards of racially profiling students after they were barred from entering the building on Monday. "What's the difference between a student and a protester?" a student leader asked someone from the faculty.  Protesting students claimed that white students had been allowed to attend a lecture inside, while black students were locked outside. They demanded to speak to the dean. Two staff members told the crowd that the dean was in a meeting and could not speak to them.  They urged the protesters to set up a meeting with the dean at a later stage. Someone in the crowd muttered that it was ironic that the law department was pulling an "illegal" move by keeping out paying students.  "Why is it acceptable to continue lectures when you know there are black students outside?" another asked, shaking her head.  The group planned to move from the middle campus back to the upper campus to ensure lectures did not take place. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
