Rear Admiral Peter Gumataotao, the head of Nato Strategic Partnerships, said on Friday there was "a complex environment and ambiguity we see today in the operational environment". Nato leaders confirmed cyberspace as an official "operational domain" for alliance actions at the recent Warsaw summit, along with air, land and sea. He said that talks at the summit in July about the different threats showed "the threat base is 360°". "It is clear all these domains in the 21st centuries are interconnected. Cyber covers all these domains," Gumataotao told The Associated Press. He was speaking at a two-day Nato Strategic Military Partners Conference held in the Romanian capital. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
