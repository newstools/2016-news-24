Duncan Alfreds, News24 President Jacob Zuma has argued SAA remains a key priority for the government. Jump to bottom Cape Town President Jacob Zuma faced some tough questions in the NCOP on Tuesday on the economy and SAA.Question time only got underway after EFF members&nbsp;had been&nbsp;ejected from the chamber.Zuma said that the government was intent on supporting the creation of a Brics ratings agency to "balance" the global ratings agencies and those from a particular "school of economic thinking".On the question of Finance Minster Pravin Gordhan facing possible arrest, Zuma said the Cabinet supported Gordhan, but would not interfere in the operations of an independent entity such as the NPA.Interfering with independent entities would result in the country becoming a "banana republic", Zuma said.SAA lossesReports have emerged that NPA head Shaun Abrahams had a private meeting with politicians at Luthuli House to discuss charges against Gordhan. Zuma, however, denied this."I must also say the matter was never discussed with Abrahams with the President. Never, never, never, never."And the meeting that the honourable member is referring to I m sure he s keen to know the details that meeting was a meeting between the president and the security cluster, discussing a totally different matter not the matter of any arrest."The president argued that State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) required support and acknowledged that the SOE Council had not been established.Despite SAA making a loss of billions, Zuma rejected an MP s assertion on the value of the company."I m not looking at selling the company," said Zuma, adding that SAA was engaged in a turnaround strategy with the guidance of Treasury.Zuma insisted that the reappointment of SAA Board Chair Dudu Myeni would help stabilise the company and bring visible improvement.Students hypocriticalProtesting students were hypocritical if they argued for the importance of education, but&nbsp;destroyed educational institutions and disrupted those who were pursuing their education, said Zuma in response to a question."The issue of free education is being attended to," said the president, arguing that the commission&nbsp;was doing its work.Zuma announced that research conducted by the Presidency found that moving Parliament to Pretoria would, in the long term, save money and allow MPs more time to engage with the public.Despite Parliament having to make a decision on a move, Zuma said research into moving was not wasteful expenditure."Investigation helps you takes a wise decision."The president said the government s Phakisa (Accelerate) programme had unlocked R17bn in private and public investment and the programme aligned with the 9 point National Development Plan.President Jacob Zuma says Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan's fraud charges were not discussed at a meeting with NPA head Shaun Abrahams at Luthuli House.Zuma was answering questions from MPs in the National Council of Provinces on Tuesday.Here comes the fees question &nbsp; Zuma: The issue of free education is being attended to &nbsp; IFP MP Khawula says logic to move Parliament not sound.
