Shaun Abrahams must be held responsible for this unacceptable blunder. Questions remain regarding whether this was in fact malicious prosecution, what the consequences have been on the economy, and lastly, the damage to the reputation of the Minister of Finance."Maimane called on President Jacob Zuma to suspend Abrahams with immediate effect."Jacob Zuma must now act decisively, failing which we will have no option but to believe that he is behind these malicious political antics."Abrahams told the media on Monday that the decision to prosecute Gordhan had not been made by him, and he had reviewed it when the two parties made submissions.He did not see the need to resign over the debacle."Will I resign? Certainly not, certainly not. I don&rsquo;t owe anyone an apology," he said.In making his decision, he had applied his mind to the law, he said."Neither Pillay, Gordhan or Magashule spent a day in court," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
