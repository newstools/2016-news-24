How do we get higher levels of what we now call inclusive growth so that all South Africans feel that they are part of benefiting from the GDP? How do we ensure that public finances collected from your taxes is spent in the right way and is largely of benefit to the ordinary citizens of this country and not pocketed in the value chains that you are familiar with?"He said the medical fraternity needed to ensure better access to medicines and health care, particularly for the poor."It is a fact of life that poor people are still made to wait [in long queues] at public places and that there is much to be done in ensuring that public servants become real public servants who go out of their way to care for people and that they leave the public health facilities that they have visited as quickly as possible, that they have been treated as efficiently as possible and treated with the necessary care that they deserve."Gordhan also urged the fraternity to take a stand against corruption."Stolen bed sheets, medication, food, lack of care in our public hospitals and sometimes private hospitals as well. Supply chain interference, good invoice for but not delivered, public servants and businesses people exchanging favours in the form of brown enveloped in order for things to be done, that is corrupting us from delivering efficient&nbsp; human rights to our people," said Gordhan. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
