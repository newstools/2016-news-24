They are in direct contravention with the Constitution&hellip; and an insult to our constitutional democracy" said the Democratic Alliance's Student Organisation leader Yusuf Cassim in a statement.On Saturday, ANCYL president Collen Maine made his call at a "Hands off Zuma" march in Durban."Comrades from Umkhonto we Sizwe, bring your guns. Now is the time to defend the revolution. We must do it. Generations that came before did it. They sacrificed their lives," he told the approximately 4 000 peacefully gathered at the event.Responding to the comments, Cassim described the ANCYL as "an irrelevant organisation, existing only as a lobby group for ANC factions that are unethical enough to call on their support when it suits them".Sparking the country into anarchyEarlier, Cope announced that it would open a criminal case against Maine.Cope's spokesperson Dennis Bloem on Sunday said that "Maine's utterances may just spark the country into anarchy".Bloem said that he would lay the charges at the Garsfontein police station on Sunday afternoon."Statements like those of Maine belong to the past and they must be left there."Meanwhile, AfriForum Youth said it was consulting lawyers to decide whether to also lodge a complaint against him."We want to be sure that if we do it, everything will be right and reasonable," its spokesperson Morne Mostert said.The ANC Ethekwini Region organised Saturday's event, saying it believed that Zuma was being targeted.The march comes in the wake of drama around outgoing Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's "state capture" report.&lsquo;Hamba Madonsela&rsquo;On Friday, Black First Land First (BFLF) protesters marched to the Public Protector's office in Pretoria to defend the president.They carried posters reading "hamba Madonsela" and "hands off Zuma" as they rushed up to the gates of the office complex.Others held signs accusing Madonsela of being in cahoots with the wealthy Rupert family and acting in the interests of white monopoly capital. &nbsp; Meanwhile, this week, Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema was handed a summons by police indicating that he was being charged for contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act.The two charges are for contravention of section 18 (2) (b) of the Riotous Assemblies Act. The summons alleges that on the December 16 2014, during the party&rsquo;s elective conference, Malema incited party members to commit a crime, by occupying any vacant land they came across.A second summons indicated that he has been charged a second time for a similar transgression for making the same call in Newcastle on June 26.It was widely reported in 2014 that AfriForum had laid charges against Malema for the land invasion speech at UFS.In reacting to the summons, EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu called the move an "apartheid era tactic".He said the government was using a 1956 law to go after Malema. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
