"I don't need to be accepted by the UPND. I am here, and I am the president. I am accepted by Zambians and the world at large. So what is their problem? I don't need recognition from them," Lungu was quoted as saying over the weekend.He said that due electoral processes were followed when he was elected the country&rsquo;s president; therefore, the main opposition was not going to deter him from carrying out his job.This came just less than a week after opposition leader Hichilema and his deputy Geoffrey Mwamba were being charged with "unlawful assembly" and "seditious practices".The two, however,&nbsp;pleaded not guilty to the charges and were released on bail&nbsp;last Thursday after spending a night in custody.&nbsp;They were set to appear in court on October 19.&nbsp;If convicted they could face up to seven years in jail.Hichilema has accused Lungu, the country's election commission and court judges of all being guilty of fraud over the August 11 election, which Lungu won by barely 100 000 votes. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
