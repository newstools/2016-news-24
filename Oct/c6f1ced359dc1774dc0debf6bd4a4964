More family pets will run away from home during holidays involving fireworks than any other days of the year," said spokesperson Lisa Storck.The Hindu community celebrates Diwali on Sunday, October 30, and New Year&rsquo;s Eve is celebrated on December 31. Fireworks are set off on both occasions.Here are a few precautionary measures that can be taken when fireworks are set off:Storck said animals that were sensitive to thunderstorms would most likely also react badly to fireworks."The SPCA does not enforce the laws relating to the use of fireworks. The Explosives Act is enforced by the SAPS, to whom matters of concern need to be reported."This Act covers sale of fireworks, as well as issues relating to the discharge of fireworks in public places. Local by-laws regulate the discharge of fireworks on private property."She appealed with community members to be considerate to animals. &nbsp;Storck said the Animals Protection Act clearly states that "it is illegal for any person to terrify any animal".She said any deliberate act of frightening or harming animals involving the use of fireworks may lead to prosecution under the Animals Protection Act 71 of 1962.Stray and lost animals could be brought to the SPCA alternatively contact 031-7641212/3 or 073 335 9322 for emergencies.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
