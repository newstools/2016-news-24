A company that has trained dogs to recognise the smell of human faecal bacteria has been sniffing out sources of water pollution nationwide. The dogs have discovered broken sewer pipes, leaking septic tanks and illegal sewage discharges. The dogs give an instant yes-or-no indication as to whether a particular location is contaminated with human faecal bacteria. That's much faster than lab testing. Otisfield, Maine-based Environmental Canine Services uses dogs rescued from shelters and specially trained to detect human waste in the same way other dogs are trained to sniff out drugs or explosives. They've helped eliminate pollution in 15 states. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
