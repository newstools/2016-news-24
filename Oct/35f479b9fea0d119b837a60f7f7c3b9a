But on Wednesday night, it was clear this one was not going to make it."We said to the Libyan coast guard that we were entering no matter what because the boat was sinking, and they finally accepted," Messinis said.A MAOS spokesman confirmed the rescue operation took place in Libyan waters, explaining that it was a rare occurrence: it had happened at least once before, several weeks ago, and once again with the Libyan coast guard's permission.'He was crying'By the light of their floodlights the rescuers managed to pull to safety 113 people including 89 men, 11 women, 11 teenagers and two younger children.But survivors told MOAS that there had been some 130 people on board originally. The list of the missing includes a 16-year old girl, five adolescents and a little boy who had been soon to turn three."I was on the rubber boat with my son, he was crying and holding on to me. The sea was rough and the boat was taking on water. At one point some people started to panic," his Nigerian mother told rescuers."The next thing I knew I was pushed into the water and I lost my son in the chaos as I was trying to grab a life jacket. In a few days he would have been three years old," she was quoted as saying in a MOAS statement.Despite the stormy weather, the ships spent an hour searching the waters in the darkness, but found neither survivors nor bodies.Many of those rescued were suffering from fuel burns, including a woman in a state of shock with 36 percent of her body covered in first degree burns. She could not be evacuated immediately due to the bad weather.Mixed with salt water, the fuel has devastating effects on the skin, particularly for women who, unlike men, often do not want to remove their contaminated clothing for modesty or religious reasons.Some 145,000 migrants have been picked up and brought to Italy since the start of 2016. According to the UN, at least 3,626 people have died during the perilous crossings or are lost at sea.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
