Both opposed the application.They were still waiting for a response from Icasa and Maxegwana.The SABC came in for criticism in July when it fired Foeta Krige, Suna Venter, Krivani Pillay, Thandeka Gqubule, Busisiwe Ntuli, Lukhanyo Calata, Vuyo Mvoko and Jacques Steenkamp for speaking out against the broadcaster's policy to not show footage of violent protests.Seven were reinstated when the Labour Court set aside the dismissal on July 26. Mvoko, who was employed as a freelancer, lost his case against the SABC.Steenkamp has since resigned from the SABC and will take up a new post in New Zealand in November.Motsoeneng meanwhile was removed as COO in September following a Supreme Court of Appeal ruling that his appointment to that position be set aside, but was reappointed to general executive for corporate affairs this month.WATCH this video:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
