Never, never, never," he said.Zuma said the issue is currently before the court, and was therefore inappropriate to discuss it in the House, but said it is concerning for all South Africans.He said Gordhan, like all citizens, is innocent until proven guilty, and that no individual can or should intervene in a state prosecution.Also present at the meeting on October 10 was Justice Minister Michael Masutha, Minister of Social Development Bathabile Dlamini and State Security Minister David Mahlobo, a Sunday Times report said this weekend.Masutha told journalists on Monday that the meeting was held to discuss the issue of ongoing fees protests.State capture reportZuma also addressed the issue of former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's unreleased state capture report.He said, as a citizen of the country, he was exercising his right to go the courts to interdict the release of the report.Madonsela had not talked to him or asked him questions in the compilation of the interim report, and that is why he applied for the interdict, he claimed.Four EFF MPs meanwhile were ejected from the House before Zuma spoke on Tuesday.EFF MP Tebogo Mokwele raised a point of order early on, and was first to be asked to leave by house chairperson Thandi Modise after refusing to allow Zuma to speak.She said he was not a "legitimate president" because he "broke his oath of office".Mokwele was followed by EFF colleagues Younus Vawda,&nbsp; Vusi Mtileni and Nkasigang Koni, who all stood on similar points of order.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
