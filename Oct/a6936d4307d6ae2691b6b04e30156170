I will not go out and campaign again and ask any woman to vote like I did before. I will never do it again," said Aisha Buhari, whose grandfather was Nigeria's first defence minister.She suggested that the government had been hijacked by a "few people" who have made key official appointments. As a result, she said Buhari did not even know most of the people holding top posts in the country.Buhari was voted into power in 2015 on an anti-corruption platform and Nigerians have largely praised the retired general for his commitment to restoring order and accountability. But the country's economy is battered by a recession as global crude prices sink while the oil-producing south has been hit by a wave of attacks by rebels. Buhari is divorced from his first wife Safinatu, with whom he had five children. He married Aisha, 45, in 1989. They also have five children together.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
