She went by the name Francis McDonald in the 1990s.'It's an absolute disgrace'Deputy Minister Luwellyn Landers was critical of the appointment when asked by the committee, and said her hiring was a disgrace."How did this person become an ambassador for the Republic of South Africa?" he said."It's an outrage, a total outrage.""This portfolio committee has raised issues in the past about ambassadors, but this is probably the worst case we've had to deal with."It's an absolute disgrace, and I say this in my capacity as deputy minister."'This is not about politics'The SSA withdrew Ngubeni's security clearance on October 7, but with only two months left of her three-year term, it was "a laugh" and of little consequence, Landers said.He said both the department and the SSA had a case to answer for hiring Ngubeni and he asked the committee to take firm action when holding those responsible for her hiring&nbsp;to account."This is not about politics, this is about South Africa and its relations with people," he said."Now when we send a new ambassador somewhere, what are they going to say about us?"He also said a diplomat has access to a "diplomatic pouch", which can only be opened by a High Commissioner.9kg of heroinIt was unacceptable that someone convicted of drug smuggling could be the only one with access to it in that country, he said.MPs thanked Landers for his honesty, and his desire to get to the bottom of it.The Sunday Times also reported that Ngubeni was arrested on September 20 1995, at OR Tambo International Airport and charged with smuggling 9kg of heroin into South Africa from Thailand, but was acquitted in 1997.She is the daughter of late MK operative Michael Mpandeni Ngubeni and had been nominated by "senior political leadership" in 2013.The SSA spokesperson told News24 on Thursday that the matter was being investigated, but couldn't comment further on the developments. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
