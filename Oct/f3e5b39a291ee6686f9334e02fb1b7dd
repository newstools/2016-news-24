The ongoing fees protests reached boiling point this week when Wits University protesters burned a bus in Braamfontein. This week two security guards were hospitalised after they were allegedly locked in a burning building at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology's Bellville campus in Cape Town while scores of students have been arrested. "While the UDM supports the principle of free education, the Fees Must Fall campaign in its current form is out of control," Kwankwa said in his letter. They had a responsibility as leaders to see if mediation between students, institutional representatives and government stakeholders could not be achieved, he said. "The fact that the academic year has been interrupted and the destruction of learning infrastructure, personal injury, arson and vandalism is unacceptable. The current state of affairs at our tertiary institutions warrants urgent attention and that we do everything in our power to try and find a speedy and lasting solution," he continued.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
