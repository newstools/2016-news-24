If this child could [allegedly] kill a person who loved him, looked after him, what stops him tomorrow from stabbing me?" Mapisa-Nqakula asked.Her son was killed in October 2015 while she was abroad on national duty.It is the first time the defence minister has spoken publicly about the pain of losing her son. A teary-eyed, Mapisa-Nqakula told News24 in an exclusive interview that she believed the murder was premeditated.READ: Chumani Nqakula's alleged killer not fit to stand trial, court hears"If there was a streak of madness at the time, I don't expect that the [accused] would have stabbed him once, run away and thrown away the knife," Mapisa-Nqakula said. She dismissed speculation that there were drugs involved and that an altercation had ensued, saying doctors and police found no evidence of that."As doctors were doing the post-mortem, there was no sign of a scuffle, or anticipation. It all shows a weapon went in, Chumani's body went into shock and he died on the spot."However, she admitted that her son smoked dagga, but said he always insisted that he was not on any other drugs, nor was he a drug addict.She said Higuera grew up in her family and was close to her son who "baby sat him". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
