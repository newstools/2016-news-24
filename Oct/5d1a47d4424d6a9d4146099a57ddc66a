BLF has prepared court papers showing evidence of how Gordhan is conflicted and thereby unable to carry out his duties impartially".He said the movement would give Gordhan's lawyers five days to oppose the matter.Treasury's Yolisa Tyantsi would not be drawn to comment on the matter.WATCH this video:24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
