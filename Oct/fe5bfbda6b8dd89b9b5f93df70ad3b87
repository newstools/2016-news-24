Burundi's government has silenced independent journalists at home and arrested several foreign reporters, accusing the international media of being part of a "conspiracy" to overthrow it. The US-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) estimates 100 journalists have been forced into exile since the violence erupted.The CPJ this week urged Burundi's national intelligence service to release radio journalist Salvador Nahimana, detained since October 2.Another journalist, Jean Bigirimana, of the independent Iwacu newspaper, has been missing since July 22.Burundi, which has cut ties with the United Nation's rights office as well as the International Criminal Court (ICC), on Monday banned five new organisations, including the Burundi Union of Journalists and the rights group SOS Torture.They are considered to be "disturbing state order and security," according to the interior ministry.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
