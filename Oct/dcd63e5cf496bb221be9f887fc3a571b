Francisco – Hillary Clinton's strategy for her presidential campaign as
Election Day nears is simple: do no harm. Her
opponent, Donald Trump, is battling an onslaught of sexual misconduct
allegations, opposition within his own party and negative media coverage. At the
same time, Clinton maintains a cautious presence on the campaign trail. She
rarely veers from her script during modest-size events and seems determined to
let Trump make the news, little of it positive. Clinton
is also relying on a team of what her campaign calls
"uber-surrogates" like President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle
Obama. With
under a month left to campaign, Clinton spent on Thursday fundraising in
California and planned to spend most of the weekend out of the public eye. The
candidates' final debate is scheduled for next Wednesday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
