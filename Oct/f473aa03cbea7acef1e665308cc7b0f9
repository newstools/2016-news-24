Jammeh came to power in a 1994 coup, and has ruled The Gambia with an iron fist ever since.Independent probe&nbsp;Before the nation's last presidential vote in 2011, the 15-nation Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) said Jammeh's control of the media and intimidation of voters meant the election could not be free and fair.The strongman took 73% of the vote.The Gambia's newly appointed Independent Electoral Commission assured political parties last month the vote would not be rigged, despite fears that an opposition crackdown is already underway.Commissioner Alieu Momar Njie told reporters in Banjul: "The stakes may be high, and temptation may be great to achieve victory through illegal or morally questionable means in some countries. "I stand here today to pronounce to you that, as far as our concerted efforts are in play, this will never be the case in our dear country."UDP party leader Ousainou Darboe - the runner-up in 2011 - is among several opposition figures serving three-year sentences for organising a peaceful rally over two party members' deaths in custody.The UN, France, the US and human rights watchdogs have all voiced concern over the deaths and called for an independent probe.Campaigning for the election begins on November 16.Since independence from Britain in 1965, the Gambia has had just one other leader: Dawda Jawara, who served until the current president toppled him in the 1994 coup.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
