States should not be profiting off weapons that are being used to kill civilians."The rights group also accused the United Nations (UN) for failing to adequately respond to the atrocities in the east African country.&nbsp;At least 300 people were killed, while 42 000 others fled the city of Juba in July following &nbsp;four days of intense gun battles.The violence echoed the fighting that triggered the civil war and marked a fresh blow to last year&rsquo;s peace to end the bitter conflict that began when President Salva Kiir accused ex-rebel and now Vice President Riek Machar of plotting a coup in 2013.Amnesty International's report was released ahead of a field mission to South Sudan by the African Union&rsquo;s Council (AUPSC), scheduled to take place between 28 and 30 October.&nbsp;The group called on the AUPSC to look into the July violence during its visit, and to take steps "to ensure the establishment of an independent hybrid court able to investigate and prosecute these and other crimes".&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
