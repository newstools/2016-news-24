R2K organiser Joanne Adams told News24 that they were approached by students to march from King Dinizulu Park to the SA Human Rights Commission offices.She said the low numbers would not deter R2K from supporting students. "We will always give support."She added that students had approached R2K because of constant police brutality. "They felt the SA Human Rights Commission should investigate what has been happening to them."In the message that called for students to join the march, R2K said it had seen university managements and government responding to the fees crisis with violent repression. "This only leads to a cycle of violence. The right to organise, protest and speak out is central to all community struggles for social justice. Instead of cracking down on dissent, the university management should focus on addressing the problems that have forced the protest action."It added that the behaviour of law enforcement was not fitting for a democratic society. "There is a huge amount of evidence in video footage, images and reports from observers of police brutality, unprovoked attacks on protesters, disregard for basic police rules of engagement."R2K continued: "Rather than containing the situation their methods have led to the escalation of conflict. We are also deeply concerned about the reports of rape and sexual assault of students by police. This is an unacceptable abuse of power and violence that is a criminal act and should be dealt with the seriousness it deserves."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
