An officer took the car keys away.The driver was charged with reckless and negligent driving, driving while intoxicated and possession of an unlicenced firearm."I am very grateful that I did my part. I was a nervous wreck and fortunately it ended well," said Small.'Don't drink and drive'Smith said this was not an isolated incident. Previous accidents such as this had resulted in the deaths of innocent motorists.With the festive season approaching, Smith warned motorists to be responsible.Motorists should preferably not drink even one alcoholic beverage when driving as it affected judgement."Don't do something that causes us to dispatch 20 traffic officers at you because by the end of that, there are a lot of supporting affidavits that are going to make very sure you will sink when you get to court."The driver was booked in at Maitland police station and was apparently appearing in court on Monday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
