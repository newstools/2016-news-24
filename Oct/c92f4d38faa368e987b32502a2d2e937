EU officials have for months discussed a proposal to promote private investment in countries where many migrants come from in order to encourage them to stay home. Unlike Turkey, it is difficult for EU countries to work with still lawless Libya to curb the migrant flow and possibly easier to try to ease poverty in Africa. Fortress Europe&nbsp; More than one million people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa flooded into Europe last year, sowing divisions across the 28-nation bloc and fuelling the rise of far-right parties. Some 145 000 migrants have arrived in Italy since the start of 2016, almost the same number for the whole of last year.In the run-up to the summit, the activist group Oxfam denounced the EU approach to migrants as building a "Fortress Europe" that forces them to take dangerous routes into the wealthy bloc."As well as closing borders and outsourcing border control to neighbouring regions, the EU is now refocusing its foreign and development policies around the primary aim of curbing migration, of stopping people on their way to Europe and sending them back to where they come from," it said.Development aid should be "used for reducing poverty and inequality, not for reducing mobility," it added.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
