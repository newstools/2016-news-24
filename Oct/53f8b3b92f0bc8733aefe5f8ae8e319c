Kenya's Daily Nation on Thursday reported that Zuma's visit to the east African country had left "a bitter taste in every Kenyan's mouth". Many Kenyans had expected the issue of visa rules imposed on Kenyan travellers to be ironed out.

"The expectations attached to the trip were simple: the visa rules imposed on Kenyan travellers had to be change very fast. "What Kenyans got was, however, a promise to 'consider' the request officially handed in by his host, President Uhuru Kenyatta," the report said.
