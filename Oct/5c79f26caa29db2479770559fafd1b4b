The lawsuit filed late on Wednesday in Manhattan federal court seeks to have the law banning so-called "ballot selfies" declared unconstitutional. The lawsuit said publishing a voted ballot on social media can be a powerful form of political expression. It says that someone claiming they voted without photographic proof reduces the credibility of the individual. Attorney Leo Glickman said the lawsuit is consistent with claims made in Michigan, Indiana and New Hampshire, where similar laws have been struck down. A message seeking comment from the New York attorney general's office was not immediately returned. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
