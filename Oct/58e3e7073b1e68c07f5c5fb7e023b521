The time has come to decide what we want to leave behind for our children," Ouattara said.Parliament has until October 15 to approve the text in order to submit it to the public in a referendum on October 30.Other revisions include removing a maximum age of 75 for presidential candidates and making it easier to change the constitution in future.Political coalition&nbsp;Opposition politicians and some civil society groups have criticised the drafting process as lacking consensus and transparency.Pascal Affi N'Guessan, the head of Gbagbo's FPI party, now the main opposition, criticised the proposed creation of the post of vice president and a senate, a third of whose members would be appointed by the president, among other changes.He said they would allow Ouattara to entrench the political coalition between his RDR and the other main party, the PDCI."These are changes that take us backward, that offer no solutions to the problems that the country has known but allow one clan to take the state hostage," he told Reuters.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
