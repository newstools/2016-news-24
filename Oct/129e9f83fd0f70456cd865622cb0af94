His agenda for the UCLG included putting local government at the centre of a "changing world". "I am confident that, with the support from here at home in South Africa, across the African continent and other global regions, UCLG will become the gatekeeper of our people's quest for solidarity, justice, respect for human rights and dignity for all," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
