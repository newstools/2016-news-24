Loss of lives has occurred due to a stampede," said a government statement.As the heaving crowd chanted slogans for freedom, some protesters lobbed stones and bottles at security forces who responded with baton charges and volleys of tear gas.There were some reports of gunfire.Merera Gudina, chairman of the opposition Oromo Federalist Congress, told AFP he believed there had been many more fatalities than the number officially announced."Bodies are being collected by the government. But what I hear from people on the ground is that the number of dead is more than 100," said Gudina.'Days of rage'&nbsp;Oromo activists called for "five days of rage" to protest the deaths while a strong police presence was visible as the news of the day's events spread.As the disaster unfolded Sunday, police demanded that AFP's photographer leave the scene, where rubber bullets were seen strewn on the ground."This government is a dictatorship, there is no equality or freedom of speech. There is only TPLF. That's why we must protest today," said Mohamed Jafar on Sunday, referring to the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front.In 1991 the TPLF, then a rebel group, overthrew dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam, and now, as a political party stands accused of monopolising power.Every year millions of people in the Oromo region mark the Irreecha festival on the shores of Lake Harsadi, which they consider sacred.The anti-government protests started in the central and western Oromo region in 2015 and spread in recent months to the northern Amhara region."For the last 25 years the Oromo people have been marginalised in many things. Today we come together as one to chant for our freedom," said one of the people at the festival, Habte Bulcha.Together, Oromos and Amharas make up 60% of the population of the Horn of Africa nation and have become increasingly vocal in rejecting what they see as the disproportionate power wielded by the northern Tigrean minority in government and the security forces.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
