There is no time for pointing fingers. Your call for fees to fall is a legitimate one," she said to cheers.The meeting between students and Madonsela, Max Sisulu, Sello Hatang, Bishop Malusi Mpumlwana and former Cosatu secretary general Zwelinzima Vavi was billed as a &ldquo;peace accord meeting&rdquo;.It was intended to discuss how to end the protests on campuses and discuss free higher education. No Wits University management representatives were present.The meeting began at the Holy Trinity Church in Braamfontein, next to the campus. Students however said the venue was too small and called for it to be moved to Solomon Mahlangu House.Wits Vice Chancellor Adam Habib was in the church, but was forced to leave when students said they did not want him there. They said he should have been arrested, instead of former Wits SRC leader Mcebo Dlamini, who was denied bail by the Johannesburg Magistrate&rsquo;s Court earlier on Wednesday.Students sang and ululated to welcome Mandonsela. Some shouted that they loved her and wished she would take charge of the country.Madonsela thanked students for reminding the country&rsquo;s elders of why liberation struggle heroes fought for democracy. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
