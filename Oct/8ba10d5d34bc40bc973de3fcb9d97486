"The man was arrested by officers from the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, assisted by armed colleagues, in the street in Holloway Road" in north London, the police said in a statement. London's Metropolitan Police said they had used a taser during the arrest but that no shots were fired. The police said they "made the item safe" after it was found on a train on Thursday and that the package was now being "forensically examined". "The public will see more officers, including armed police, in and around transport hubs to provide reassurance around public safety," it said, adding that the Underground was working as normal. Counter-terror detectives opened an investigation on Thursday after the suspicious item was found on a train at North Greenwich station, which serves The O2 entertainment complex, formerly the Millennium Dome. The police said in a statement on Thursday that "a controlled detonation" of the package had taken place. Since August 2014, the terror threat level in Britain has been classed as "severe" - the second highest level, meaning an attack is considered "highly likely". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
