That slight elevation is part of what makes the performative space so valuable because it stands out above road level. It means you are very visible whatever you are doing.&rdquo;ConditionsDuring discussions, HWC CEO Mxolisi Dlamuka said South Africa was in its current space because of a negotiated settlement, not because of a revolution.Referring to the statue application, he said: &ldquo;We are here&hellip; because victims have said this is a symbol of pain.&rdquo;The committee&rsquo;s decision, which is subject to a 14-day appeal period, contained a number of conditions.It said the future of the plinth and the interpretation of the space would be resolved with a separate application in terms of the National Heritage Resources Act, and following ongoing discussion with the university community.The statue should continue to be stored and safeguarded. Any conservation work to the statue was subject to the separate application.The future location of the statue was also subject to Heritage Western Cape&rsquo;s (HWC) approval.Klopper told the committee it was very important that the university not be kept to a timeline on this process. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
