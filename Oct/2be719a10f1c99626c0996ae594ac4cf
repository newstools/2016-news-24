On Day 14 of the Panayiotou trial, Brigadier Gary McLaren was grilled on the stand by the defence's Advocate Terry Price. Next up on the witness stand is forensic specialist WO Phillip Bekker, armed with his specialised equipment. Jump to bottom Slide 64 shows the gun residue kit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: I detail the procedure in my affidavit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a firearm is discharged, in the back of the cartridge is a unique chemistry composition for the primer. When a person is tested positive for this residue it means a person was in close proximity of a gunshot.MS: On the 1cm mark, on the thumb, can you tell us what we see there?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: that is blood transfer stains, most likely transferred from the bullet wound to the chest.PB: We see this in incidents such as suicide, where the gun is clutched in the hand, despite rigour not having set in yet. The same happens in motor vehicle accident victims clutching the steering wheel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I cannot say that the rigour set in before, as the body was already in full rigour, it is my opinion that this is the case here.MS: I want to ask you about the clutched hand. What would the explanation be for the hand being clutched? PB: There is something that normally occurs in the death process. It is not part of rigour mortis, but it is called the cadaver spasm. Normally when there is a lot of tension in muscle groups the body goes into immediate rigour.PB: Slide 59 shows high-velocity specs on her hand, similar to what was found on the face.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the proximity of the face and the hand and the similar splatter, it is my opinion this was from one event.The next slide shows her hand being bagged.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS: Were you able to come to any conclusion regarding the cuts to the hands of the deceased? There are two possibilities: one is when a ring is removed, or it might have been wounds sustained in contact with raw metal, such as in the boot of a vehicle. These little wounds, were not in my opinion defensive wounds.The next slide shows her hand covered with mud.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: This type of mud splatter occurs when the skin is in close proximity to water. My opinion is that the hand had been in that position when there was a slight drizzle.Slide 49 shows the hair of the deceased.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: What was noticeable was the ponytail was pushed forward by the hood of the sweater.PB: This is an indicator that the head remained static for the blood to flow and follow contours.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This blood together with blood under the head is a good indicator that the body had not been moved.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;PB: Slide 48 shows the right ear of the deceased. The ear was filled with blood that had pooled inside the ear itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This blood was flowing from the ear itself and followed the contours as it was pulled down by gravity.The next slide shows small blood drop splatter on her cheek.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: this is called a high-velocity stain and is consistent with gunshot.Toni and Michelle Inggs are in tears.&nbsp;PB: There is a pool of blood under her head. The pool of blood saturated the ground.Christopher Panayiotou&nbsp; is showing emotion as a close-up image of Jayde s face is shown.The next few slides show the body from different angles. PB: The legs are together, the right arm slightly extended, left arm curled up slightly to the chest.PD: Body was in rigour mortis already and at ambient temperature.PB: The body was of an adult female, fully dressed with all clothing intact.Mom and Toni holding hands, comforting each other.PB: The next slide [40] shows body in the position I found her on the crime scene.On the next slide, the body is visible.Tony Inggs starts crying.PB: Slide 26 shows an area under the bushes. It had plastic water bottle and hessian bag; all had been there for a long time.PB: The next few slides detail items found in the corridor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These items were collected and tested for touch DNA.PB: The next slide shows the corridor into the bush. As you can see in the centre of the photo there is a ridge approximately 8m into the corridor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This ridge was covered with the same ground cover.PB: [next slide] This shows where a print was lifted by the dog unit. This is also the point where the final tyre tracks were found and I used this point to plot the GPS points.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;PB: Due to the softness of the sand, the vehicle tracks may be insufficient for analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; What I did notice on slide 14, there are indications that the tyre reversed back onto itself. This normally occurs when you make a u-turn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This process also contributed to destroying the print.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;PB: On my way to the crime scene I gave permission telephonically to the dog unit to lift the tyre and shoe tracks in the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason for this was due to the forecasted wind which destroys these types of evidence. I gave him the go ahead. &nbsp;&nbsp;On my arrival, they were still busy lifting the tracks.PB: The crime scene was very well managed by the police on the scene. They established 3 cordons that kept everyone out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first was at the cattle grid and two more towards the scene itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The crime scene itself was undisturbed upon my arrival.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And only the members of the dog unit were active on the scene itself.Jayde s mother and sister, Toni and Michelle Inggs, are in court.&nbsp;He goes through more slides showing the area, including the dirt road, which shows a vehicle track, a tyre track that ran 16m.He points out a cattle grid that was at the entrance to the dirt road and says approximately 400m up the road was where the crime scene was located.The crime scene itself was in a clearing in the bushes.Bekker goes through the first few images in his presentation, showing where the crime scene is located.MS: Thank you. Now did you attend to a crime scene on the 22nd of April 2015?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: That is correct. On the 22nd of April 2015 I was taken to a crime scene outside Kwanobuhle.Bekker reads his CV onto the record.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Marius Stander, for the State: How long have you been with SAPS?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PB: I have been with the police for 25 years and in Crime Scene Investigation for 17. During that time I have processed in excess of 8500 crime scenes and approximately 4000 lab cases.The State calls witness number 33. W/O Phillip Roedolf Bekker.Chetty: I would like to advise that this can be quite unsettling and would advise anyone who would not like to be present to leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may proceed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Judge Chetty: Before we swear in the next witness the gallery is warned that some of the evidence that is going to be led by this witness is graphic in nature.Court reconvenes.&nbsp;The vehicle in question in the Panayiotou trial, parked outside court.&nbsp;(Derrick Spies/News24)&nbsp;The vehicle in question in the Panayiotou trial, parked outside court.&nbsp;(Derrick Spies/News24)&nbsp;(Derrick Spies/News24)&nbsp;PD: I require access, but it has nothing to do with Stoger. But it will be done under supervision&nbsp;Chetty: Mr Stander, you can't argue with that&nbsp;MS: Well, my lord, I then recall Mr Stoger as he has not been excused by the court&nbsp;[Stoger called in and sworn in]&nbsp;TP: No questions&nbsp;PD: No questions&nbsp;Chetty: Stoger, you are excused&nbsp;MS: I ask that we can have the morning break&nbsp;MS: Our next witness is Bekker (the forensic specialist), who will be bringing his equipment in, that will link in with the equipment in court&nbsp;MS: He will be testifying over the next two days&nbsp;Chetty: Court is adjourned until 14:15&nbsp;PD: Your lordship should not allow him now to further investigate, because he realises he has a problem Chetty: You don't require the system to be brought here&nbsp;PD: No, I do not&nbsp;PD: After you decided that the evidence is admissible, I don't agree with your finding, and I will argue later that the evidence is not admissible and I will not be cross-examining him&nbsp;PD: It is not that I give it any weight&nbsp;PD: I still require access to the instrumentation and software, but that has nothing to do with evidence led here. I will be calling my own expert witnesses so that they can examine it.&nbsp;MS: There is one reason that I want to call the witness&nbsp;MS: At least one of the parties are saying they want access to software and GPS device&nbsp;MS: I want to ascertain that on the 31st of October that device was working correctly, before any other expert is given access to that device&nbsp;MS: If they are saying they do not want access, but if the intention is to get access to the module, the GPS and the software then it is important that I preserve them&nbsp;MS: My lord, we have Stoger, who is here&nbsp;MS: Since the cross-examination has not yet begun, I would like to recall him before, and we would like to discuss the accuracy of the vehicle GPS TP: I object my lord, because this is yet another case of trial by installment, or trial by ambush!&nbsp;Chetty: The evidence being led is to the efficacy of the equipment&nbsp;TP: It is our argument, and we will be arguing that he is not an expert witness&nbsp;PD: The position is this, he told the court he has no further questions. He has completed his evidence in chief&nbsp;PD: The witness is now in cross-examination&nbsp;PD: He is saying he is entitled as a right, that is not the case. He hasn't the right to lead the witness without his lordship's position&nbsp;PD: He now seeks to qualify the witness further as an expert in light of the objection I raised, in light of Mr Stoger's qualifications&nbsp;PD: What has happened here is that he did not properly qualify Stoger as an expert witness, despite your overruling of my previous objection&nbsp;PD: Now he wants to lead new evidence&nbsp;TP: Was Siyoni informed that he was being considered as a Section 204 witness?&nbsp;GM: I don't know what was said by Mayi&nbsp;Chetty: So you're saying that this was a thought in the back of your mind?&nbsp;GM: Yes&nbsp;[back to the objection]&nbsp;TP: [reading from the warning statement from Officer Koen] In paragraph 7, Koen states that while giving the warning, he noted an injury to Siyoni's right eye, and when asked he said he had been injured during his arrest&nbsp;Chetty: The point is said, that you say he said he was assaulted&nbsp;TP: It will be part of our argument&nbsp;Chetty: Noted&nbsp;TP: No further questions for the brigadier&nbsp;PD: No questions&nbsp;MS: No further questions&nbsp;TP: That is ridiculous, he was arrested at Accused No. 1's business premises. The minute he was arrested Christopher Panayiotou was informed. By late afternoon, they had seen the CCTV [footage]&nbsp;GM: I was not aware&nbsp;TP: Did Mayi not tell you that he had arrested Siyoni at the Infinity Bar?&nbsp;GM: No, he did not&nbsp;TP: So in retrospect, would you not say that the move to Fort Beaufort was pointless?&nbsp;GM: It was fruitful&nbsp;TP: Did I hear you correctly earlier, you said that you had already considered him a Section 204 witness before he even gave his statement?&nbsp;GM: It was in my mind&nbsp;TP: Did you discuss it with anyone?&nbsp;GM: No, I was at home&nbsp;TP: Brigadier, when did you first see Siyoni?&nbsp;GM: The 1st of May&nbsp;TP: Where?&nbsp;GM: Shirley street&nbsp;TP: And was his [Siyoni] injury still visible?&nbsp;GM: No&nbsp;TP: You saw nothing?&nbsp;GM: I never saw anything out of the ordinary&nbsp;TP: It was said to Swanepoel in the Section 204...&nbsp;TP: Why did you want Siyoni out of PE so badly, what was the real reason? Why could an officer involved in the case not take a statement the next morning?&nbsp;GM: I wanted to keep it as quiet as possible. In my discussions with Mayi we had already discussed the possibility of Siyoni becoming a Section 204.&nbsp;GM: Very serious allegations were being made against Accused No. 1 (CP) and one of the ways to establish if these allegations were true or not, would have been at some stage to establish if he was prepared to become a Section 204 and arrange a meeting between the two individuals&nbsp;GM: This is not the first time I have done this, my lord. In the case of State vs David Best, which Advocate Price defended, this was done as well.&nbsp;[TP addresses Chetty]: I don't know where he's going with this, my lord&nbsp;TP: Let me ask again, why did you not get a magistrate or officer to take the statement?&nbsp;GM: We did not want it to get out&nbsp;TP: Who were you trying to hide it from?&nbsp;GM: Accused No. 1 (Christopher Panayiotou)&nbsp;&nbsp;- BACK IN SESSION -&nbsp;TP: We are aware there are magistrates in Fort Beaufort?&nbsp;GM: Yes&nbsp;GM: There is a court there&nbsp;TP: And there are police officers there&nbsp;GM: Yes&nbsp;TP: And 20km from there is Alice, where you also have magistrates and officers&nbsp;GM: That is correct&nbsp;TP: And you never thought of asking a magistrate to take his statement?&nbsp;GM: It was 10pm at night, you will never get a magistrate at that time. It never even occurred to me.&nbsp;TP: Were you ever aware that prior to going to Fort Beaufort that he told Officer Greef he had been assaulted?&nbsp;GM: No&nbsp;TP: Were you aware that he also told Koen?&nbsp;GM: No&nbsp;TP: And when he spoke to Swanepoel he again said that he was assaulted?&nbsp;GM: No&nbsp;TP: When did you see Siyoni for the first time?&nbsp;[MS interjects]: It is a bit late now as the horse has jumped the stable, but Siyoni never told Swanepoel that he was assaulted&nbsp; TP: Let Mr Griebe now call up the statement...&nbsp; Jump to top
