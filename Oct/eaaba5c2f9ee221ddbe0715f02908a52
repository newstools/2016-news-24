Send us your eyewitness accounts and photos. This comes after the NMMU Council resolved that the university would reopen to lecturers on Monday and classes would resume on Tuesday. The university also got a court interdict to prevent any unlawful gatherings, specifically those that prevented access to campus grounds by non-protesting staff and students.Members of the NMMU Fees Must Fall Movement have said the university acted in bad faith and that they would ensure that the campuses remain closed.The Xanadu Melody clubhouse, which is situated on South Campus near the residences, was completely gutted by the fire.NMMU spokesperson, Zandile Mbabela, confirmed the fire took place during the early hours of Monday morning and that they were still trying to assess the damage."The matter is viewed in a serious light and is under investigation," she said.The FeesMustFall movement used its Facebook page to distance itself from the arson, blaming rogue elements seeking to delegitimise their struggle."We are fighting for free education and we understand that after we win this fight we need an institution to return to, one with infrastructure to build a better tomorrow, one with facilities that speak to the needs of Africa and the world over," the movement said."We are very angry that our facilities have been disrespected to this degree, similarly we are of the opinion that arson is not a revolutionary act but a crime that should not go unattended, thus as a movement we strongly condemn such acts," the post stated."We will work with the law enforcement in our capacity to ensure that those who threaten to harm our resources are brought to book, similarly we encourage all of those who know anything to come forward to ensure the same."There is currently a strong police presence at NMMU, but no sign of protesting students.(Derrick Spies, News24 Correspondent)24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
