Johannesburg - The Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University (SMU) will close on Monday to demonstrate its "collective institutional commitment to and support" for the campaign to achieve free education for the poor. This was announced by acting Vice Chancellor Professor Chris de Beer on Sunday in a missive to staff and students. "This letter serves to inform you of the decision to close the University on Monday 10 October 2016." "The closure is aimed at demonstrating our collective institutional commitment to and support of the campaign to achieve free education for the poor as soon as possible.  I wish to confirm that, in the interest of the safety of students and staff, current access control and related safety measures will remain in place," he wrote. "Both students and staff expressed their concern regarding the loss of academic time during the past two weeks and the negative impact thereof on the university’s ability to meet accreditation prescripts and to complete the 2016 academic programme in good time," he said. De Beer added that, with the limited time remaining, the university believed that the aspirations could still be achieved by way of a revised academic recovery plan. "I wish to call upon all stakeholders to assist the University to successfully deliver on its mandate, despite the challenges faced by the higher education sector. Let us all work toward a normalised situation on Tuesday 11 October 2016," he said. WATCH this video:
