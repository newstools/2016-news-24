Once formal notification is received, the country's departure from the 124-nation body will only become effective after a year.However, ICC spokesperson Fadi El Abdallah told AFP that even if a country leaves the ICC it is still bound by any ongoing actions.In April, ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda launched a preliminary investigation into reports of "killing, imprisonment, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence, as well as cases of enforced disappearances".The initial probe is aimed at determining whether there is enough evidence to proceed to a full-blown investigation by ICC prosecutors which could result in charges against those believed responsible for the violence.Abdallah said the court had had "overwhelming support of African states" when it opened in 2002 as the world's only permanent war crimes court.Its mission was "to fight impunity for atrocity crimes, and by so doing, strengthen the rule of law, break the cycles of violence and to contribute to peace and stability."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
