Here we need people who will appreciate that even the departed have a right to dignity."We simply cannot keep a manager who fails to show leadership and cannot take decisive action to resolve challenges," said Dhlomo.In Wednesday's meeting, staff members told Dhlomo that other grievances included issues of overtime and complaints about inadequate supply of protective clothing.Dhlomo committed to resolving the matter urgently, as it affected the staff morale at the mortuary.As Dhlomo was leaving the mortuary, he was met by the manager in question and he told her to leave and to return only when she had received an indication to return to work. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
