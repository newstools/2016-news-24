The financial impact of four emergency schemes was not part of our immediate budget. The schemes helped us augment water supply."He added that as an additional measure to fight the drought a drought water levy was introduced on September 1.Consistent rainUmgeni Water engineer Steve Gillham said despite good rains there was still no water in coastal catchment areas."People are seeing rain thinking that they can use water as normal.
