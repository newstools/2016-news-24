However, her lawyers were in the High Court in Pretoria to contest Local Government Minister Des van Rooyen&rsquo;s application for an interdict to stop the report&rsquo;s release.Zuma had applied for an interdict, which would be heard on Tuesday.The EFF, Cope and UDM were in the court on Friday to ask it to compel Mandonsela to release the report."The EFF is of the view that none of the applications for a court interdict hold water because the applicant (Van Rooyen) will not suffer irreparable damage as there still exists an option for a judicial review of the finding and remedial actions of the Public Protector," the party said in a statement.Lawyers for the DA, which laid the state capture complaint with Madonsela&rsquo;s office, were on standby to oppose Van Rooyen's interdict. The party said it did not want to delay the report's release."The first prize must be the immediate release of the report, and the dismissal of the interdict immediately. The DA will not let this go without a fight. We will do everything possible to ensure the report is released," leader Mmusi Maimane said in a statement. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
