The Minusca force is seeking to support the administration of President Faustin-Archange Touadera, who was elected in February. Gervais Lakosso, the coordinator of the civil society coalition calling for the UN to withdraw, said Monday that "wherever the UN forces go there is violence"."Civil society believes Minusca has shown passivity and complicity," he added.One of the world's poorest countries, the Central African Republic descended into sectarian bloodshed after the March 2013 ouster of president Francois Bozize, a Christian, by the Seleka rebel alliance.This triggered revenge attacks and a spiral of atrocities between Christian and Muslim groups in which thousands were slaughtered and a tenth of the population displaced.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
