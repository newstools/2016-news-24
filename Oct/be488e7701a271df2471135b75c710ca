Jump to bottom Price circling for the kill shot: So out of the kindness of your heart and caring of your bank you gave him the information he asked for Burger: No that is not correct &nbsp; Price: He says that with the username he could see that money was withdrawn from her account but he couldn t see where, which is why he contacted you &nbsp; Burger: Yes he did tell me that he could see money was withdrawn from her account &nbsp; Price: I remind you that you are under oath Burger: I did not give him the information Price: I want to get one thing straight with you. I know that you did not have authority to give information on the account. What we want to know is did Christopher tell you that he wanted information to try trace her. Do you dispute that?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burger: No Price: You appreciate that that is one way to find a person, follow the money? Burger: Yes that s right Price: That is not my question. In these conversations did he not say that he needed to know what transactions were done on the account because they needed to trace her&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burger: Even if he did say that, I still did not confirm whether there were any withdrawals from her account &nbsp; Price: Did he not at one point tell you we need to find her and one of the ways to find her is through finding out what transactions are done on her account&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burger: I did not give him any information on the account as he did not have signing powers on the account &nbsp; Burger: At that stage I did not know that she was missing. He just told me that she was supposed to have been at school and it happened Price: You told this court you repeatedly called him to find out if she had been found Price: Jayde is missing, you know that. And you heard that money was being drawn from her bank card&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burger: Not at that stage that I spoke to him&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Price: Not in one of the 14 calls did it come up Burger: The client asked me if there was any money being withdrawn from her account. I never told him that money was being withdrawn &nbsp; Stander: Can I accept that even if you had the authority, you would not have done it at his request Burger: That is correct &nbsp; Burger takes a look at Panayiotou s cellphone records. &nbsp; Stander: You can see there are certain blocks labelled Estelle, that is your number and there are certain locks marked Nedbank which is the general landline Price: If you look, you see that when the shop was opened it suggests that he opened the shop Best: That is correct Price: That is when the state alleges Mr Panayiotou was at home? Price: Can anyone who has Mr Panayiotou s code open the shop under his code?&nbsp; Best: Yes, correct Jump to top
