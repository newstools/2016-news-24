And when the former SABC chief operating officer speaks, words fail many. &ldquo;Some leaders are born. Like myself, I am a born leader, so you can&rsquo;t take that away from me. I have been leading from a young age. "From Standard 3 I was a leader, even leading my own teachers,&rdquo; he bragged in October last year. He clearly thinks he&rsquo;s a special fellow, who can only be understood by the equally special.&ldquo;All that many educated people know how to do is to read the whole day. They don&rsquo;t have time to think,&rdquo; he scoffed in June this year. But one of his best statements is this one in May, defending his 90% local content rule:&ldquo;I am Hlaudi Motsoeneng, baby! I am in charge. I will make sure that it happens. Nobody will go against what I have put in place &ndash; this policy and those responsible for implementing directly report to me.&rdquo;Donald TrumpUS presidential candidate Donald Trump thinks he&rsquo;s awesome, boasting about his &ldquo;gifts&rdquo; and &ldquo;achievements&rdquo;.&ldquo;My IQ is one of the highest and you all know it! Please don&rsquo;t feel so stupid or insecure; it&rsquo;s not your fault,&rdquo; he tweeted in July.After fellow Republican Maro Rubio commented on his tiny hands, Trump said:&ldquo;My fingers are long and beautiful, as, (it has been well documented), are various other parts of my body.&rdquo;He also thinks he&rsquo;s never wrong. In September last year he told US TV host Jimmy Fallon: &ldquo;I think apologising is a great thing, but you have to be wrong. I will absolutely apologise, some time in the hopefully distant future, if I&rsquo;m ever wrong.&rdquo;He&rsquo;s sensitive to the slightest criticism. In an apparently unprovoked attack on Huffington Post boss Arianna Huffington, he said she was &ldquo;unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man &ndash; he made a good decision&rdquo;.Kanye West His music video for Famous caused a stir this year, featuring sculptures of the naked bodies of himself, Donald Trump, Kim Kardashian, Taylor Swift and many others in bed.In the song, West says he made Swift, whom he labelled a &ldquo;b*tch&rdquo;, famous. West&rsquo;s self-adoration became apparent in 2009 when he said: &ldquo;I am God&rsquo;s vessel. My greatest pain in life is that I will never be able to see myself perform live.&rdquo;In 2013, he said on the US&rsquo;s Wendy Williams show:&ldquo;I am the number one human being in music. That means any person that&rsquo;s living or breathing is number two&rdquo;.The same year, he referred to his fashion talents, saying: &ldquo;Visiting my mind is like visiting the Herm&egrave;s factory.&rdquo;But he didn&rsquo;t like the criticism that his latest showing at New York Fashion Week got, and reportedly fired 30 members of his team.Because Kanye is never wrong.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
