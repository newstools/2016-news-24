A mast pole Multimedia &nbsp; &nbsp; User Galleries &nbsp; &nbsp; News in Pictures Send us your pictures &nbsp; &nbsp; Send us your stories According to a notice from Metrorail, commuters should expect a 30 to 40 minutes delay as Metrorail is forced to continue with alternative transport arrangements between Retreat and Simon&rsquo;s Town Stations until further notice.This is due to a mast pole that the wind blew over between St James and False Bay Stations on Thursday 6 October. Mast poles are the steel/concrete structures supporting the overhead traction equipment for train operation. Mast poles are affixed onto large concrete bases built next to the rail tracks.Riana Scott, Metrorail spokesperson says technicians have already rebuilt a replacement mast pole but were unable to re-erect it as initially planned. &ldquo;They were faced with three options; the first and preferred option was to have removed the existing concrete foundation and re-erect the new mast pole onto the existing base. When this proved impossible the second option was to drill a sufficiently large core into the existing concrete base with specialised core drilling equipment. The procurement of potential service providers for this option is already underway. Should the second option also prove fruitless, the technical team will have to construct a new concrete foundation from scratch. Alternative transport arrangements apply until the successful re-instatement of the mast pole,&rdquo; she saysTo create capacity on the line the following Fish Hoek-bound trains will turn around at Retreat: T0183 T0195 T0205 T0225The following Simon&rsquo;s Town-bound trains will terminate at Fish Hoek: T0227 T0207 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
