In short, Oakbay demanded that on behalf of government I intervene with the banks to achieve a reversal of their decisions (to bar the Guptas from using their services)," reads Gordhan's affidavit.His application includes letters he'd received from Nazeem Howa, CEO of Oakbay Investments, one of the Guptas' most prominent companies, and from Stephan Nel, CEO of the Guptas' Sahara Computers.Gordhan has listed the so-called big four banks - namely Standard Bank, Nedbank, Absa and FNB, as respondents in his application. Gordhan would like to see the banks submitting to the court the reasons why they had terminated their relationships with the Guptas in order to determine if it had been done over concerns relating to possible contraventions of the Financial Intelligence Centre Act (Fica).What&rsquo;s in the reports?"Should Oakbay challenge the proposition that any or all of the banks was indeed bound by law to report under FICA in such terms, it is open to Oakbay in terms of . . . FICA to require the banks to disclose to this Court the full contents (of) each of the reports in question," reads the affidavit."If the banks have acted lawfully and within the parameters of their statutory duty these (the banks' reports) should evidence the bases on which each reporting bank has concluded that the dealings in question could directly or indirectly make that bank a party to or accessory to contraventions of the law," Gordhan says in his affidavit."Conversely, the full reports, if disclosed pursuant to FICA, would confirm whether there is any substance to the serious contentions advanced by Oakbay that the banks have acted improperly in closing the accounts," maintains Gordhan. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
