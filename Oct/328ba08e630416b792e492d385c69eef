South Africa and Gambia followed suit, raising fears of an exodus of African countries, many of which are founding members of the court."Withdrawals from the ICC constitute a serious obstacle to the rights of victims to justice and the duty of states to ensure accountability for mass atrocities. They close an important recourse to justice and undermine the global fight against impunity," said AGJA member Hassan Bubacar Jallow, former prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and, like the ICC's current chief prosecutor, a Gambian national.AGJA noted that African countries including Botswana and Senegal had voiced their concern at the announced withdrawals and encouraged others to remain committed to the court. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
