	     Johannesburg – President Jacob Zuma says he will not respond to the EFF, UDM and Cope until the court grants the parties’ permission to oppose his application to interdict the release of the state capture report. The three had joined the matter to oppose an urgent interdict filed by Co-operative governance Minister Des van Rooyen on October 14. However, that fell away on Friday when the minister filed a notice of withdrawal of his bid. The three political parties will then write to the high court next week seeking to oppose Zuma’s application set to be argued on the November 1. The matter was initially put down for the October 18, but was postponed to allow all parties to file their papers so it could be argued together with the local government minister’s application. In a late night affidavit served on the political parties’ legal representative, which News24 has seen, the president said he was advised that it’s not permissible for him to participate in the proceedings until such a time as he has been joined as a party. “I have delivered an answering affidavit to the DA’s application for the intervention,” the president’s papers read. He comprehensively dealt with basis of his objection to the DA's application, he says in the papers.  The main opposition party had joined to oppose both Van Rooyen and Zuma’s interdicts. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
