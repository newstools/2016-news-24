after her car plunged nearly 150m off a cliff at Smitswinkel Bay, between
Simon's Town and Cape Point, on Wednesday evening. Rescuers, however, struggled to reach the
partially-submerged vehicle that was on the edge of the shore. The car appeared to have left the road and crashed off
the cliff but the cause of the accident is unknown. According to NSRI spokesperson, Craig Lambinon, rescuers
were eventually able to reach the car after a Police Sea Borderline Patrol boat
deployed a police officer on to the shore. The woman, who was the only occupant, was in a critical
condition. A helicopter was sent to the scene, carrying a paramedic
who helped the police officer treat the woman. Two NSRI rescue swimmers were also deployed from a rescue
boat to assist. Once stabilised, the woman was airlifted to hospital.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
