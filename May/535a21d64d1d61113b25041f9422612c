The layout would consider the preferences of pupils who suffer from the condition, which severely hampers communication.The schools would receive more funds than others because of their extra needs.Many parents of autistic children struggle to afford the high fees of private special needs schools and those who do obtain a bursary have to travel vast distances to get their children to school and back.On other breakthroughs in the province, Lesufi said: No Grade 12 classroom used chalk, a chalkboard and a blackboard duster anymore having changed over to paperless systems; Learning one African language would be compulsory from Grade 1 in 2017;Every pupil who occupies first, second or third place in a township school will get a four-year bursary;A School of Specialisation was launched in the province this week. Among the specialised equipment there was the engine of a Boeing 747 to allow pupils to learn how to assemble it. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
