He did not give a date for the vote.In his speech he did not make reference to claims by the opposition that he was attempting to seek a third term in office, but said it was "quite normal" for the government to re-examine the constitution.However, several government members said they were in favour of a change to the constitution to allow Abdel Aziz to run for a third term.Abdel Aziz came to power in a coup in 2008. He was then elected president in 2009 and again in June 2014 for a second five year term.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
