Jenna Etheridge, News24Cape Town &ndash; Two Atlantis men were&nbsp;jailed for separate cases of child rape, ahead of Child Protection Week, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said on Monday.Atlantis, which lies about 40km north of Cape Town, had seen its fair share of brutal sex crimes against women and children over the years, said Western Cape NPA spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila.He said the most recent sentences dished out by the Atlantis Regional Court involved a 9-year-old girl and 10-year-old boy.The men were sentenced just before Child Protection Week kicked off around the country on Sunday.On Thursday, Nigel Goedeman was&nbsp;sentenced to&nbsp;20 years in jail for two counts of rape.He lured a girl away from her friends with the promise of circus tickets for her family.Ntabazalila said she went with Goedeman to a secluded area where he&nbsp;had threatened her with a knife when she wanted to return to her friends.He forced her to the ground, raped her and threatened to kill her if she told anyone.&nbsp;She went home crying and told her mother, who reported it to police.The girl identified her rapist in a photo identity parade.Goedeman had a previous conviction for sexual assault in 2009.&nbsp;The court on Thursday found substantial and compelling evidence not to sentence him to life imprisonment, said Ntabazalila.The same court also sentenced Lee-Mervin Tieling Philadelphia for raping a boy.He received a 15-year sentence, of which five years were suspended with conditions."The accused and the minor were smoking dagga together, whereafter the accused had sexual intercourse with him. A member of the community heard of the incident and informed the mother of the little boy," said Ntabazalila.The mother reported the incident to police.Philadelphia apparently confessed that he was aware of the boy&rsquo;s age and&nbsp;knew he was too young to give consent.Anneke Snyman prosecuted both cases.She said the sentences would give Atlantis residents confidence in the justice system.It would also encourage complainants to come to court and testify, she said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
