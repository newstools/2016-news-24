The violence broke out on Thursday morning, after the teacher was served with a notice of suspension, education department acting district director Busi Luthuli said. "Learners wanted the principal to be dismissed and not the teacher," Luthuli said. She said pupils locked teachers and workers inside the school grounds while they demolished the office building. They broke windows and overturned tables. "I rushed to the police office, but they were helpless." She said officers stood by and watched as pupils destroyed the office. Local residents watched from outside the school fence. Grade 11 pupil Hamilton Chauke said pupils went on a "violent strike" after the letter was served on the teacher. Chauke, a student leader at the school, told News24 they would continue to fight for their teacher. Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi met members of the school governing body on Friday.
