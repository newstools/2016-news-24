Derrick Spies, News24 CorrespondentPort Elizabeth &ndash; A man was shot dead and another two injured on Tuesday morning near the Port Elizabeth Magistrate&rsquo;s Court where murder accused Christopher Panayioutou was appearing.The apparent gang-related drive-by shooting occurred in Govan Mbeki Avenue about 500m from the courthouse. The incident was not thought to be related to Panayiotou&rsquo;s case.Police spokesperson Warrant Officer Alwin Labans said the men, all in their thirties, were apparently on their way to the court when shots were fired at them at around 10:00 on Tuesday.This was amid a high armed police presence, including members of the Tactical Response Team, at the court. Their presence was attributed to the high number of gang related cases being heard on Tuesday."Four men were inside a navy Golf travelling down Govan Mbeki towards the court. A second group of men, travelling in a gold-colour Mazda Etude pulled up alongside and opened fire on the vehicle," Labans said.Man shot 8 timesHe said a passenger in the backseat had been fatally wounded, while two other occupants had been injured. One was shot in the back while the other sustained injuries to his hand and head.The fourth escaped unharmed.Labans said the matter had been handed over to the police gang unit for further investigation.Witnesses at the scene said the deceased man had been shot at least 8 times, with at least 12 shots fired in total."It sounded like a semi-automatic or something, the shots came fast and loud and then the car [Golf] swerved, hit the pavement in the middle island. The driver accelerated to try and get away from the other car but the front wheel buckled and the car collided with the pavement on the other side of the intersection," he said.Labans said no arrests had yet been made. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
