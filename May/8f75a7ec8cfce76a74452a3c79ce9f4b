Sadtu provincial secretary Dolly Caluza said that classroom overcrowding is more prevalent at schools in the townships and rural areas. Our teachers are struggling a lot, especially when it comes to overcrowding and the dislocation of the post-provisioning norm. In some schools you find that there are 100 pupils in one classroom and it is difficult for pupils to focus and even ask questions because the environment does not allow for a teacher-pupil connection. The set-up puts a lot of pressure on pupils to accept the situation. In some schools there is no workshop that could help pupils choose their subjects carefully towards what they intend to do after matric, said Caluza, adding that the majority of the pupils end up doing subjects that are irrelevant to their career choices. She said some of the teachers are not qualified to teach. That kills our education system as a country. You ve got teachers that travel long distances from their home to school, but they earn peanuts. The number of teachers must not depend on the number of subjects each school provides, it must depend on the number of pupils each school has. We can t have 70 pupils in one classroom just because they have a few subjects, she added. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
