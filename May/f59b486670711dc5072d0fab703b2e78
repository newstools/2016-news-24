	     Cape Town - Crowd control training for rookie police officers has been increased from a few days to three weeks in response to changing times, Police Minister Nathi Nhleko said in the National Assembly on Wednesday. The two or three days of training in public order policing that officers received at the beginning of their careers was not enough anymore, said Nhleko. The extended period was in line with the Farlam Commission of Inquiry's recommended changes to public order policing. These were contained in the commission's report into the deaths of 44 people during strike-related unrest at Lonmin's platinum mine in Marikana, North West, in August 2012.  Nhleko said new recruits were being trained in how to approach groups during protests and how to use equipment. South Africa wakes up to almost a protest a day. In the most recent one, residents of several informal settlements in Hammanskraal began protesting on Monday, against attempts to evict them. Two people were killed.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
