She and her husband lived alone in a big house," she said.The internationally acclaimed author was found dead in her home in Third Avenue, Uitsig, on Wednesday.Her husband, Dr Matthew Rust, 87, woke up from the sound of the bell at the gate around 15:30.When he got up to see who was at the gate, he found his wife dead on the kitchen floor. She had injuries to her face and her hands and feet were bound.Provincial police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said there had not been any new developments in the case.Residents had been registering new neighbourhood watches for the past two years, De Kock said.&nbsp;Currently, there were no physical patrols in the area and locals kept in touch via a WhatsApp group.The 72-year-old said she was disturbed by the well-known resident&rsquo;s murder."It&rsquo;s terrible that she may have shouted and no one heard her. The people here live in big houses and during the daytime the elderly in Third Avenue are alone because the young residents are working," De Kock explained.Only Rust&rsquo;s cellphone had been stolen, as far as De Kock knew.Neighbours on Thursday told Netwerk24 that they heard loud noises coming from the Rust home on the day she was murdered.Elsibe Loubser described the crime as tragic and very strange."She was one of the most respectful and stylish people in the neighbourhood," she said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
