It decided to acquit Marcos Mavungo," judge Simao de Sousa Victor said in the court decision.Mavungo's lawyer Francisco Luemba told AFP that his client was freed from prison immediately after the ruling.Mavungo was a former member of Mpalabanda, a group which was banned in 2006 after it produced reports highlighting rights abuses by security forces in Cabinda province.Cabinda, an Angolan territory separated from the rest of the country by a strip of the Democratic Republic of Congo, accounts for 60% of the nation's crude oil production.Most of its 300 000 residents live in poverty, and a separatist guerrilla movement has rattled the province for decades.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
