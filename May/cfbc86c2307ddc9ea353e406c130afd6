	     Durban - A baby boy became collateral damage in an argument between his parents, when the pair allegedly dumped him at the roadside in Inanda on Wednesday.  Reaction Unit South Africa spokesperson Prem Balram said that security officers and paramedics had rushed to the scene shortly before noon.  "Reaction Unit South Africa members were dispatched to the scene after receiving a call from a resident reporting a baby lying on the roadside," he said.  "Upon arrival, it was found that the father of the child had returned and informed officers that he and his 20-year-old girlfriend lived separate lives. "She allegedly informed him that she no longer wanted the child and had contacted the Child Welfare to put the baby in a place of safety. The father refused and suggested that the child be sent to live with his girlfriend’s mother in Eshowe."  The couple began arguing while on their way to the taxi rank, Balram said. "She then threw the baby on the ground and informed her boyfriend that he should take the child on his own or leave the child on the roadside." He added that the couple and the baby were handed over to the police for further investigation.
