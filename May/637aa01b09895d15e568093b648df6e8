"He had lost a leg from what looked like above the knee, so it was quite a savage attack by the looks of it," said Hondros.Life guards had tweeted earlier on Tuesday that a 3.5m white shark had been seen off a nearby beach on Tuesday morning.It was the first serious shark attack in Australia since March, when 22-year-old professional surfer Brett Connellan was badly injured off an east coast beach south of Sydney.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
