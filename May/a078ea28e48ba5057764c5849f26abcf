The human rights group said it believed that around 1 200 people were&nbsp;currently detained at Giwa barracks in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. Many were arbitrarily rounded up during mass arrests. "The discovery that babies and young children have died in appalling conditions in military detention is both harrowing and horrifying. We have repeatedly sounded the alarm over the high death rate of detainees in Giwa barracks but these findings show that, for both adults and children, it remains a place of death," said Netsanet Belay, Amnesty International&rsquo;s Research and Advocacy Director for Africa.According to Premium Times, at least 12 children had died in Giwa barracks since February, despite regular medical checks.One witness told Amnesty International that they saw the bodies of eight dead children, including a 5-month-old, two one-year-olds, a two-year-old, a three-year-old, a four-year-old and two five-year-olds.The group said at least 7 000 detainees had died in military detention in Nigeria since 2011 as a result of starvation.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
