He had also told the court that he believed that the 17-year-old was possibly involved with Satanism because of the way she had changed her hair colour, nail colour and lip colour to black.However, Pottas claimed that her hair changed back to normal again before she was killed and that her sombre mood also changed back to the happy person he knew. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
