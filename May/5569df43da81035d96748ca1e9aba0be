Jenna Etheridge, News24 Durban – A man who allegedly opened fire on a couple at an Inanda taxi rank, killing a man, is to appear in court next week, KwaZulu-Natal police said on Sunday. The 37-year-old apparently approached Sphamandla Mkhulise and his girlfriend at the Ezimangweni taxi rank on Monday evening, said police spokesperson Major Shooz Magudulela. Mkulise, 43, was shot dead. His girlfriend was wounded and rushed to hospital. The gunman fled the scene on foot. Magudulela said they roped in other units to trace him to a hideout in the Inanda area on Thursday. An unlicensed 9mm pistol, found in the man’s possession, would be tested to see if it had been used in any other shootings. He would face charges of murder, attempted murder, and possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition in the Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
