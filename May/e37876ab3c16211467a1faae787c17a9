Who knows what is going on here?&rdquo; asked Lawrence.Ngcobo replied that the matter had been put to rest and &ldquo;all such information&rdquo; was provided in detail previously.&ldquo;This is creating confusion in the market about the manner in which this matter is being dealt with. I do not have the answers,&rdquo; he said.Mayor Chris Ndlela ended the discussion, saying the confusion needed to be clarified outside the meeting between the councillors and Ngcobo.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
