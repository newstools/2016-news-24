The parks authority relies on donations from well-wishers to supply water for the wildlife, and volunteers to carry out patrols to ward off poachers.The export of elephants to China angered international animal rights groups, but some local conservationists back government plans to sell off wildlife."Zimbabwe is facing one of its worst droughts ever, even worse than 1992 when thousands of wildlife were decimated," Jerry Gotora, a conservationist and former chair of the parks department, told AFP."All our national parks are in the driest regions and the biggest question as we experience this drought is 'who is going to feed the wildlife and who is going to give them water?'"24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
