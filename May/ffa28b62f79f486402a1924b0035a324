Cape Town – The ANC in Parliament has reshuffled
some of its committee chairpersons to fill existing vacancies and strengthen
the capacity to fulfil oversight functions, the party said. Former higher education and training portfolio committee
chairperson, Pinkie Phosa, is the new chairperson for the appropriations
standing committee, the ANC said in a statement. The post was left vacant when Paul Mashatile
became Gauteng human settlements MEC. Phosa’s position on the higher education committee will
be filled by Connie September, who was the chairperson of the joint standing
committee on intelligence. Former police minister, Charles Nqakula, will take over
the intelligence committee, ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu said. The communications committee will be chaired by Humphrey
Maxegwana, who takes over from former MP Joyce Moloi-Moropa, who resigned from
Parliament. Mabe whip of
finance committee Environmental affairs committee will be chaired by
Phillemon Mapulane, taking over from Mthembu, who is now the chief whip of the
party. Pule Mabe will fill Minister Des Van Rooyen’s shoes as
the whip of the finance committee. Mabe was recently rapped over the knuckles by
Parliament’s ethics committee for benefiting from a contract with a state-owned
enterprise. This comes after Mabe was implicated in irregularities at
the embattled Passenger Rail Association of South Africa (Prasa). According to Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's damning
report, Derailed, Mabe's company KG Media was "improperly" awarded a
R33m communications deal. Mthembu said he had no doubt that the changes would
further "reinforce Parliament’s oversight role over the executive and
enhance quality service delivery to the people of South Africa".
