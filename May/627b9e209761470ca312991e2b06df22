Africa is the undisputed rape capital of the world.Journalist Gillian Schutte posted excerpts of written exchanges with Jansen on Saturday and Sunday, in which Jansen said: "In their culture a woman is there to pleasure them. Period. It is seen as an absolute right and a woman's consent is not required."She also said: "I still have to meet a black girl who was not raped at about 12. I am dead serious."As excerpts of the conversation were shared on social media, comments flooded back reflecting shock that a judge could hold such opinions.Speaking to News24 at the weekend, Jansen said that the comments referred specifically to the cases she had handled.The Judicial Services Commission (JSC) confirmed on Tuesday that Jansen had requested that Justice Minister Michael Masutha place her on special leave.Complaints were laid against her by Advocate Vuyani Ngalwana SC in his personal capacity, as well in his capacity as Johannesburg branch chair of the Advocates for Transformation.The Judicial Conduct Committee will now consider the complaints, and whether they are of a serious enough nature to warrant a judicial conduct tribunal.The special leave request was so that she would not be on duty as a judge while the process was ongoing.A petition on Amandla.mobi, which called on the JSC and the department of justice to remove Jansen had reached over 5 700 electronic signatures by Wednesday morning. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
