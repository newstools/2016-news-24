Nigeria's government has rejected comments by the UK prime minister that it is "fantastically corrupt," calling the remarks "embarrassing" and not reflective of modern Nigeria.The response came after David Cameron was caught on tape saying in front of Queen Elizabeth II that "some leaders of some fantastically corrupt countries [are] coming to Britain" for an anti-corruption summit."Nigeria and Afghanistan, possibly the two most corrupt countries in the world," Cameron said as Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari and Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani were due to attend the meeting.Garba Shehu, a spokesperson for the Nigerian president, took to Twitter on Tuesday to rebuke the British leader. "This is embarrassing to us, to say the least," he posted.&nbsp;"The prime minister must be looking at an old snapshot of Nigeria. Things are changing with corruption and everything else."Nigeria, which ranks 136 out of 168 countries in Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index for 2015,&nbsp;has struggled for years to fight corruption among its political elite.But since Buhari was elected to power in 2014&nbsp;on a campaign that vowed to root out corruption, anti-fraud agencies have arrested several senior politicians accused of embezzlement.Asked whether Cameron regretted his comments, a Downing Street spokesperson said: "Both leaders have been invited to the summit because they are driving the fight against corruption in their countries. The UK stands shoulder to shoulder with them as they do so."Money laundering in UKCobus de Swardt, Transparency International's managing director, said the UK is actually "a big part of the world&rsquo;s corruption problem"."There is no doubt that historically, Nigeria and Afghanistan have had very high levels of corruption, and that continues to this day," de Swardt said. "But the leaders of those countries have sent strong signals that they want things to change."This affects the UK as much as other countries. We should not forget that by providing a safe haven for corrupt assets, the UK and its overseas territories and crown dependencies are a big part of the world&rsquo;s corruption problem."In a stinging letter to Cameron last month, 95 reform groups in Nigeria urged the UK to do more to prevent corrupt officials from laundering stolen money through the UK's property market."Civil society in Nigeria is calling on you to take serious action to end the UK&rsquo;s role as a safe haven for our corrupt individuals, who steal our wealth for their own private gain," the letter said.Salaudeen Hashim from the West Africa Civil Society Forum told Al Jazeera that corruption and money laundering are direct causes of&nbsp;poverty in Nigeria."You see poverty staring at you on the street - simply because money that is meant to stimulate the economy is being used by individuals to build homes [in London], to take care of their own immediate families. All of this going on, at the expense of the people," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
