A 1992 Chadian truth commission accused Habre's government of systematic torture, saying 40 000 people had died during his rule.Kerry says the case provides an opportunity for the United States to reflect on and learn from its connection with past events in Chad.He says that without the persistence of Habre's accusers and their demand for justice, the former dictator might never have faced a court of law.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
