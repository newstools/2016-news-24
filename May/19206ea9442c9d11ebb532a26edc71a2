Earl Haupt @Earlhaupt Residents of Sherwood Park had Freedom Day patrol to consult with perpetrators building up squatter camps and making themselves at home on vacant plots in the neighbourhood. We consulted with two vacant plots; one in Fourth Avenue and the second plot in Fifth Avenue. After making our grievances known to them, they accepted our demands that we do not want them in our area and we pertinently advised that what they are doing is erroneous towards our community, says Shahied Francis, deputy chairperson for the Sherwood Park ratepayers association.He says that the vagrants also indulge in gangsterism, drugs, prostitution and malefaction the area. Francis claims that the residents of Sherwood Park were not assisted in their patrol from the local law enforcement authorities, despite contacting local police and metro police.Lieutenant Ian Bennett, spokesperson for Manenberg police, says neighbourhood watch patrols are to support policing. It must not be something where they demand or expect extra deployment in the area. If they wanted a special operation it can be arranged, he states. Bennett says local organisations must build up trust with the neighbours and then create good policing opportunities. Where community have identified problematic areas the police will deal with actual policing, Bennett adds.The committee however are pleased to have formed a united front with the affirmation what goes for my neighbour goes for me .24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
