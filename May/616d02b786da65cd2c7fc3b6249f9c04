Tik and mandrax were found in a passenger&rsquo;s possession and he was arrested, along with the driver who faced a charge of reckless and negligent driving.JP Smith, mayoral committee member for safety and security, said high-speed chases had become commonplace during law enforcement efforts. "It speaks to the absolute contempt that some members of the public have for law and order, but also their fellow residents. I commend the officers who doggedly pursue these 'scofflaws'," he said. "Experience has shown that they catch the culprits in most cases, which simply means a weightier charge sheet for the accused who could have made life easier for themselves by simply obeying a lawful instruction in the first place."In addition to the arrests by traffic services, metro police arrested 64 other suspects &ndash; 50 of them for drunk driving and 12 on drug charges. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
