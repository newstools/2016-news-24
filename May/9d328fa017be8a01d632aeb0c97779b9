The association was part of a delegation which attended the police portfolio committee's discussion about problems with the issuing of gun licenses. As far back as 2014, the committee lambasted the police for its fragile Central Firearms Registry (CFR) system, which was understaffed and did not have enough equipment. The committee was concerned about people abusing the registry’s weaknesses and was appalled at the state of the building CFR staff worked in. The committee's priority is to reduce violent crime by tightening up the circulation of firearms in the country. Camphor said there were areas of agreement at the meeting, including that the CFR was “seriously understaffed”. There was disagreement over the police's view that when a licence lapsed, the firearm owner was in breach of the law, criminalising them. This was a problem because due to delays at the CFR, it was difficult to renew a licence in time, SAHA believed. Camphor said that at Friday's presentations, one of the findings of the CFR appeal board was that the CFR did not properly apply its mind when assessing licence applications and gave “cut and paste” reasons. Part of its court case would be that all new licences that had expired be deemed legal until a revised renewal process had been implemented.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
