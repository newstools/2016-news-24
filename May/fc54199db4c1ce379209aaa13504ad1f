He had apparently been visiting his aunt."It seems like he was dumped there in the early hours. His body was still a bit warm," he told News24.The body had an open wound on the right cheek. The boy was dressed in a striped blue and white shirt, and trousers."There were some marks around his neck, so we suspect he may have been strangled," Sibiya said.An autopsy would determine the exact cause of death.Sibiya said they asked the boy&rsquo;s family why they did not report his disappearance."Apparently he was mentally disturbed and would come and go. So every time, he would go to visit his aunt and then he would just leave without telling anyone. They took it for granted that he was with his aunt, only to find somebody took advantage of the situation."No arrests had yet been made.Kagiso SAPS appealed to anyone with information about the crime to contact Detective Lieutenant Mudanabula on 011-696-9142 or Crime Stop on 08600-10111. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
