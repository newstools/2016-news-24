She sees the note and starts shaking. She leaves us &amp; bursts into typical white tears (like way are you crying when all we&rsquo;ve done is make a kind request? lol!)"But the student activist on Monday said he did not mean that Schultz had literally cried.He explained that "white tears" referred to when a person was "challenged to think about a question and they start getting uncomfortable"."It is not literal tears. A lot of people now think that what we did was make all these people cry. No we didn't."[Neither] the waitress, nor the manager, nor anyone actually cried. It's not true that there was this bullied waitress who cried."Qwabe said it was explained to Schultz and her manager that this was not a personal attack."A lot of the time, when people conduct protests on campuses white people feel attacked by those protests, even when it is made clear that it is not directed at them."Males do that as well when radical feminists&hellip; have carried their shamboks and said we are asserting ourselves as women and we are going to occupy this space&hellip; same thing with trans bodies. We need to work on that. "When people with marginal identities assert themselves and protest we take it personally&hellip; we need a bit more maturity," said Qwabe.Despite not writing the message on the till slip, Qwabe said he fully backed it.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
