It can&rsquo;t be manipulated it is there. You said the video is wrong,&rdquo; he said.Yengeni replied, &ldquo;I was driving normally as far as I am concerned&hellip; I watched the video and I can&rsquo;t say I did anything wrong.&rdquo;Snyman said Yengeni&rsquo;s car was out of the video screen &ldquo;at a rate of knots&rdquo; and made other cars look slow.&ldquo;A Maserati is a fast car,&rdquo; Yengeni replied to chuckles in the court room.The politician shared suspicions about his prosecution and the possibility of a conspiracy against him.He said a a politician released a statement after his arrest, saying he should be prosecuted.&ldquo;To me that indicated there is a political element to the case,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;This politician made a comment about the case that is why I thought there was a conspiracy.&rdquo;The matter was postponed to June 7.In a separate matter in 2007, Yengeni was found not guilty of drunk driving after he was arrested in Goodwood, Cape Town.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
