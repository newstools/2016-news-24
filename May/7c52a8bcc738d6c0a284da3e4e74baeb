MORE than 200 Kouga residents have found employment through the Community Work Programme (CWP) of the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta). A total of 222 CWP workers started work in their communities in April. Kouga Executive Mayor Daphne Kettledas says the first areas to have benefited from the programme are ward 1 (Oyster Bay), ward 7 (Loerie and Thornhill), ward 9 (Hankey), ward 13 (Weston) and wards 14 and 15 (Tokyo Sexwale and Ocean View, Jeffreys Bay). Site administrator Nqabisa Mvimbeli, from Hankey, says a further 302 CWP workers will be appointed in due course to service Kouga’s remaining wards. Ward 14 councillor Timothy Meleni says he was very excited that his ward was included in the first batch. “It is a great programme because it supports service delivery to communities while also creating much-needed work,” he says. Nonkolelo Mqike and Theresa Ntshobane, CWPs from Ocean View, say they were grateful for the opportunity. Both are single mothers and the work will help them put food on the table for their children. “We will also be helping the municipality to keep our communities clean from litter. A clean environment is important for the health of our communities as a whole,” says Mqike. According to Site Manager Rodney Persent from Humansdorp, the CWP workers will be encouraged to work closely with ward councillors. “They will be working for two days per week. Their focus will be any community work deemed necessary by the ward councillors, be it sweeping the streets or painting a building.”
