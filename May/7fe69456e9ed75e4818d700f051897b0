Wege's father has since come out denying abusing his daughter, and stating business ties to Mapisa-Nqakula," he said.Twisted factsIn a follow-up report this week, the Sunday Times reported that Wege was romantically involved with Mapisa-Nqakula's late son Chumani. He was killed in an argument with a neighbour last year.&nbsp; Marais said the charges would be in terms of Section 49(2) of the Immigration Act, which stipulates that: "Anyone who knowingly assists a person to enter or remain in, or depart from the Republic in contravention of this Act, shall be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to a fine or to imprisonment not exceeding five years".President Jacob Zuma has been given a report on the allegations.When the Sunday Times broke the story, Mapisa-Nqakula said they had twisted the facts by saying she had smuggled the woman on an SA Defence Force jet. She was co-incidentally due for official business in the DRC, where Wege was being held in jail for allegedly having false travel papers from Burundi.Mapisa-Nqakula helped facilitate her release. Wege was able to travel with the minister on a copy of her own passport with a South African visa in it, that she had saved on a memory stick. She said her intention was to save Wege from a life of abuse.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
