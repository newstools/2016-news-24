Today, that onslaught, which I had foreseen, is here with us," he said.He called for the same solidarity that was employed to reduce the price of ARVs, to be used in the fight against non-communicable diseases and drug resistant TB.Highlighting some examples, Motsoaledi said a breast cancer patient, who needed Trastuzumab, known commonly as Herceptin, needed R500 000 for a year&rsquo;s treatment. - R396 613.00, for colorectal cancer; - R960 000.00 for metastatic melanoma; - R204 000.00 for MRD-TB; and - R832 000.00 for XDR-TBThe minister said these examples indicated how impossible it was going to be, or already was, for many people to survive major illnesses.He said government would end up bankrupt trying to meet the health needs of its citizens.The disaster of unaffordable healthcare unfortunately affected people unequally, however.Those of higher socio-economic status were better protected and the unfortunate ones of lower economic status were left to die, he said.Deputy Minister Joe Phaahla said cancer remained one of the leading causes of death in the country, especially breast, cervical and prostate cancer.Motsoaledi said they wanted fair, just and equitable healthcare systems that would provide everyone with access to good quality care. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
