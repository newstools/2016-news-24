said. Six men accosted the driver, stuffed him into the boot of a
car and dumped him in Umbumbulu. The truck was found in Jacobs Road the

the recovery, drew a firearm and tried to shoot at police. He was arrested and
his unlicensed firearm was seized.‚Äù The guard had appeared in court and the investigation was
continuing. The arrested police officers had been linked to that
hijacking, theft of diesel, and other truck hijackings committed in February
this year. They would appear in court soon.
