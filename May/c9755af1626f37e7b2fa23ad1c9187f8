The two had been muttering to each other across the pews of the Old Assembly Chamber after National Freedom Party MP Shaik Emam, in his speech, accused the Democratic Alliance of supporting Israel and oppressing Palestinians. The background word-slinging between Paulsen and Cassim bubbled on until Cassim rose to complain to chairperson Matlala Grace Boroto. "You swore at me," said Cassim, before the two exchanged more angry words and Paulsen shouted: "You Zionist sell-out kafir." "He has used the worst profanity chairperson. He must withdraw," Cassim said. Boroto said she was not able to hear everything said on the sidelines. She asked that the two submit written accounts of the exchange to the rules committee for it to be looked into. "The Honourable Paulsen just used the k-word in this house. It is quite unacceptable," interjected DA MP James Lorimer. ANC MP Naledi Pandor rose to say that it appeared that during the verbal altercation, Cassim said something to annoy Paulsen. After Boroto's ruling, Emam explained that the word 'kafir', with one 'f', was an arabic word that meant "non-believer", and continued with his speech. Afterwards Cassim tweeted: "Nazier Paulsen of EFF is a vile individual. A hypocrite that uses Islam for his own agenda, but doesn't practice. Profanity is all he knows."
