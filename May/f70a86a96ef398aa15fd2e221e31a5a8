Human settlements mayoral committee member Joshua Ngonyama said the city did not apply for a court order to evict residents of Kanana, Suurman and Sekampaneng. He said the Kanana royal family got the order to evict them, and the city was there merely to help enforce it. Residents in the area were aggrieved because the City of Tshwane was named as an applicant on the eviction order, when, according to them, a councillor had given them permission to live on the land. They said they had paid between R350 and R2 000 for stands.Ngonyama said the city had obtained a court order to remove all illegal informal settlements in Tshwane. "The court order is still applicable everywhere in the city to enforce on people invading land. In this particular case there was a misunderstanding, which is why we intervened as government. We will enforce it as and when it's necessary," he said. Violence broke out in the township on Monday when employees of the Red Ants security company, SAPS and Tshwane Metro Police arrived to flatten their shacks and evict them. Two employees from a security company were killed and six injured in an altercation with the residents. Five people were arrested, one of them for murder. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
