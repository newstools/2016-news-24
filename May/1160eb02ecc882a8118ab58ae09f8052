We do not believe that the Acting National Commissioner has sucked information out of his thumb to now suspend Ngobeni," he said."In spite of this suspension we still demand to know on what grounds and with what justification was Ngobeni&rsquo;s contract renewed when it expired last year," Gwala said.&ldquo;There was a cloud hanging over her head for a long time and we as the IFP have been calling for her to be investigated.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
