Kaveel Singh, News24Durban &ndash; Protests have rocked the KwaDukuza area, north of Durban, since Friday,&nbsp;when three sugarcane trucks were burnt and other vehicles were stoned by protesters, authorities said on Monday. Three trucks were burnt on Friday at Ntshawini on the R102, after a minibus taxi collided with a truck, injuring several. KwaDukuza SAPS spokesperson Johannes Khoza said the accident prompted the first protest. "When this occurred on Friday, the community were up in arms, saying they have demanded speed bumps. It was very disruptive. They dispersed afterward, but toward the afternoon, they gathered again and the three trucks were burnt." The road was closed for most of Friday for fear of other vehicles being attacked. On Monday morning, more protests ensued in the Melville area, which is located 3km from Ntshawini. Khoza said people from the community gathered briefly during peak traffic to protest councillor nomination lists. "Protesters threw stones on the road and burnt tyres and skips. Police have managed to clear the area, but remain on scene ensuring peace is maintained." KwaDukuza Municipality Mayor Ricardo Mthembu last week told News24 that the community had been misled. "Someone has misled this community and said to them that the nomination process has been completed. This is not true. There are no candidates selected at the moment. We currently have a delegation of leadership addressing the people. We hope this intervention will clear the air." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
