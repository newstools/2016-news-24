Now 83 people have been arrested, 16 of whom have a direct connection with the attack. The others [have] links of varying degrees, which we need to verify," he had said, calling for a "fight against the radicalisation of young people".On March 13, three assailants armed with grenades and assault rifles stormed three hotels in Grand-Bassam, a resort popular with expats that lies 40km from Abidjan.The attack, the first of its kind in the Ivory Coast, was claimed by Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb which has also carried out similar assaults on tourist hotspots in Mali and Burkina Faso.The jihadists claimed the attack on the former French colonial capital was in retaliation for anti-terror operations in the Sahel region led by France and its allies.The suspected mastermind, Kounta Dallah, is still at large.Ivorian authorities have drastically tightened border controls and implemented security measures in the country following the attack.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
