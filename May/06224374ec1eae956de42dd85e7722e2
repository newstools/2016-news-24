The case was brought by civil rights group AfriForum.On August 3, 2015, the Supreme Court of Appeal dismissed the city's application for special leave to appeal the high court&rsquo;s ruling. It then approached the Constitutional Court.AfriForum had argued that the metro council followed incorrect procedure when it changed the names and that its actions were thus illegal.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
