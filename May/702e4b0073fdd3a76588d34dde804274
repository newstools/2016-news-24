	     Brussels - The EU is criticising "all parties" in South Sudan for human rights abuses and killings of civilians says they "must cease immediately." The 28 EU foreign ministers said in a statement on Monday that "killings of civilians, rape and other sexual violence, and recruitment of child soldiers, have been perpetrated in South Sudan by all parties in total impunity." Beyond working with other international institutions like the UN, the EU has also slapped an arms embargo on the nation and has visa bans against a number of South Sudanese officials. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
