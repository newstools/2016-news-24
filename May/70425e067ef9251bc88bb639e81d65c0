"We are doing everything according to international health regulations to guard against the spread of the virus to neighbouring countries and beyond," he said.Three cases of microcephaly have been recorded on Cape Verde but none of the rare but serious neurological disorder Guillain-Barre Syndrome, also caused by the Zika strain.In Brazil, the hardest-hit country, more than 1.5 million people have been infected with Zika, and nearly 1 400 cases of microcephaly have been registered since the outbreak began last year.Researchers estimate that a woman infected with Zika during pregnancy has a one-percent chance of giving birth to a baby with the birth defect.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
