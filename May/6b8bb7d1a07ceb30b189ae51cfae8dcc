Parliament â€“ Defiant EFF MPs were on Tuesday violently ejected from the National Assembly, again. "You can kill us if you want, we are not going anywhere," EFF leader Julius Malema said before three burly Parliament protection services guys helped him out. This after the party spent over 15 minutes raising points of orders, calling on Speaker Baleka Mbete to cancel the sitting. The party said they had never agreed to let "a thieving president" speak in Parliament. Singing Senzeni na?, the MPs were forced and carried out of the chamber, after refusing to let President Jacob Zuma speak. The EFF said they had written to the speaker, pleading with her not to let Zuma speak, following the Constitutional Court ruling on his Nkandla homestead. Water bottles, handbags and fists flew as the MPs refused to go quietly. Following the violent altercation, parties including the UDM and DA said a better system was needed to deal with these incidents. As the group made their way outside, the old Assembly door was cracked as people pushed through. The big wooden door giving access was then locked, effectively putting Parliament in lockdown. A defiant group of EFF members were seen spraying members of the protection unit with fire extinguishers.
