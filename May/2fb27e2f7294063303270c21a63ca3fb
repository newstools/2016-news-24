Mbuso Mbatho told News24 that it had been a normal Wednesday at work at the Stanger Street Post Office before chaos broke out. "I had been at my counter with some of my other colleagues and a man came to my window and asked for a deposit slip. I gave it to him and he walked away. I turned my back to the window and then all of a sudden the guy burst over the counter with a gun," he said. "He was pointing the gun at my two colleagues and screaming for them to give him the money. I still have no idea how he managed to get behind the counter," Mbatho added. The cashier, fearing for the safety of another woman who works in the back office, ran and locked her inside.Toy gun, real knife"When I closed the door for her I saw the man running out of the office. I don't know how much money he took but I just chased him," he said. Mbatho managed to chase down the alleged thief a short distance down the street and a scuffle ensued. It then emerged that the gun used in the robbery had been a toy gun, but then the suspect produced a knife. "I was fighting him for the knife but then I don't know what happened, he poked me in my head," he said. Life Response 24/7 spokesperson Leon Fourie said that the man had sustained serious head wounds and was stabilised at the scene before he was transported by ambulance to a nearby hospital. "The alleged assailant was detained by the SAPS," he said. &nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
