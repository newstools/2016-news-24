That is the reason why relentless operations are ongoing in the two notorious hostels at uMlazi and KwaMashu,&rdquo; Naicker added.The operations were carried out on Friday with one revolver being recovered at Glebelands.&ldquo;A large quantity of dangerous weapons was also seized as well as uniform belonging to the South African Defence Force. Members spent hours in the hostel being visible in the quest to claim back the space occupied by criminals,&rdquo; Naicker said.&ldquo;Prior to the high visibility operation, an intelligence driven operation was conducted at Glebelands where two suspects were arrested after they were found in possession of three firearms. All four firearms will be subjected to ballistics tests to establish if they were used in any crimes,&rdquo; he said.At KwaMashu one suspect was arrested for being in possession of stolen property, one for possession of drugs and another for rape. Naicker said police would continue to conduct operations as they hope to reclaim the hostels from criminals.&ldquo;These operations will be on going until normality returns in both the hostels and all the wrong doers put behind bars,&rdquo; he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
