Simone Gbagbo faces allegations of crimes against prisoners of war, crimes against the civilian population and crimes against humanity.This is her second trial in Ivory Coast where she is being held behind bars in Abidjan after a 20-year conviction for "attacking state security".Witnesses have accused her of personally distributing arms to death squads that operated in Abidjan during the five-month conflict but she has repeatedly denies this.Human Rights Watch said the trial "could be a pivotal moment for justice" in the world's top cocoa producer, a beacon of stability in restive west Africa until a 1999 coup that was shortly followed by years of low-level civil war.The decade of strife and last wrenching months of violence between pro- and anti-Gbagbo supporters have left deep divisions and grievances that still need to be reconciled.The trial opens just five days after the Supreme Court rejected her final appeal against the 20-year sentence she was handed last year. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
