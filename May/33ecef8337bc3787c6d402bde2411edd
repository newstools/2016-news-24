They have not yet been charged."Following Mohamed Abdi Ali's arrest, members of his network have been planning retaliatory attacks using home-made explosives," police said. "The arrest of the two has foiled terror attacks with explosives and other weapons that were planned for Nairobi and Mombasa."Materials seized suggested the pair had been plotting bombings, with kit taken for forensic analysis including "nails, ball bearings, batteries, electrical wire, fertiliser, cell phones and other suspected explosive substances," police added.While the Somali-led and Al-Qaeda linked Shabaab has been active in Kenya since 2011, after the Kenyan army was deployed in southern Somalia, there has been little evidence to date of an ISIS presence in the country.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
