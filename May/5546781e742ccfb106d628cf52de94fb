Kaveel Singh, News24Durban &ndash; The South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) in Durban South slammed overcrowding in schools during a protest at the provincial education department headquarters in Durban on Tuesday.Around 100 protesters in red Sadtu attire held placards calling for a end to overcrowding in schools, while Education MEC Peggy Nkonyeni addressed a media briefing inside the building. (Kaveel Singh, News24)Sadtu Durban South regional secretary Themba Mazibuko told News24 that the ANC Mangaung conference in 2012 had outlined the urgency for the department to address overcrowding in schools."Currently, we are sitting with some schools with 90 learners in one classroom. How can that be? Such a group cannot absorb [any lessons] or be in a position to provide quality teaching and learning. The department needs to address these kinds of issues."Mazibuko added that ANC policies had to be implemented and stressed that the national minister had to "do so immediately"."We are saying, enough is enough. These things are mandated by the ruling party and the department, and minister must do what they have been tasked to do by the ruling party."Responding to questions from media on the issue, Nkonyeni said that, provincially, "a lot of ground has been covered"."We are doing this by ensuring that schools are provided with the adequate number of teachers. I can say, without fear of contradiction, that we do not have a problem of overcrowding in this province."She added that she was confident that national leadership and Sadtu would "find a solution".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
