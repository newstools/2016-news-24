He has lung cancer.Return to jail&ldquo;Our wish is to see him return to jail as soon as possible.&rdquo;The YCLSA also said that Walus must not get parole.&nbsp;&ldquo;Walus is not a sincere character and his release on parole has the adverse potential of destabilising our efforts of nation-building and reconciliation.&rdquo;Last month, Walus, the Polish immigrant who murdered Hani, lost an application for his immediate release on parole.The YCLSA said it would intensify efforts to get President Jacob Zuma to open an official inquest into Hani's assassination.Turning to the recent burning of schools in Vuwani, the league said this vandalism must be condemned.&nbsp;&ldquo;However, government must assist us by listening to our people whenever they have concerns...&nbsp;It shouldn&rsquo;t be that people are only taken serious when they have vandalised property.&rdquo;At least 23 schools were set alight and 19 schools burnt down in recent weeks. Vuwani residents are protesting against being incorporated into a new municipality that will include Malamulele.Banks and Guptas 'worrisome'The YCLSA reiterated the SA Communist Party&rsquo;s call for banks including Absa, FNB, Nedbank, Sasfin and KPMG to explain why they &ldquo;decided to end their relationships with the Gupta-owned businesses and to close down their accounts".The situation was &ldquo;worrisome.&rdquo;Earlier this year, banks cut ties with the Gupta family following reports that they were involved in trying to influence cabinet appointments.The league said it waited with &ldquo;bathed breath [sic] for the release of the findings by the ANC of Gupta state capture&rdquo;.When it came to the reprimand letters sent by Zuma to ministers involved in the Nkandla matter, &ldquo;the YCLSA is still highly exasperated by the unfair and uncalled for decision to reprimand Public Works Minister Thulas Nxesi&hellip;&ldquo;It goes over our heads that he is reprimanded even though he joined the department when the contracts for the Nkandla were already sealed and his first task as the minister was to apply remedial action.&rdquo;'Sensational and delusional'Last month, the presidency announced that letters of reprimand had been sent to three high-ranking officials, including two cabinet ministers and one former cabinet minister, for their involvement in the Nkandla saga &ndash; in which over R240m was spent on non-security upgrades at his private residence.The distribution of the letters was part of the Constitutional Court&rsquo;s ruling that Zuma violated his oath of office by not complying with Public Protector Thuli Madonsela&rsquo;s remedial action.Turning to opposition party, the Economic Freedom Fighters, the&nbsp;YCLSA noted "the sensational and delusional utterance by EFF about guns&hellip;&ldquo;It is clear that they are preparing to bombastically cry foul when they are resoundingly defeated in our democratic local government elections.&rdquo;Earlier this year,&nbsp;EFF leader Julius Malema gave an interview to Al Jazeera in which he said that if the ruling ANC continued to respond violently to peaceful protests, "we will run out of patience very soon and we will remove this government through the barrel of a gun".&nbsp;The YCLSA said such statements were reckless and had the potential to incite violence.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
