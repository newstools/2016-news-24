Durban - Convicted murderer Rajiv Narandas has been
admitted to a Durban hospital on the day that he is supposed to report to
Westville Prison to start serving his sentence for murder. News24 understands that Narandas had been admitted to the
Life Westville Hospital. Attempts to contact his mother Rosanne were unsuccessful at
the time of publishing, but the Daily News reported that, according to her, he
was undergoing surgery. She had refused to say what the specific ailment was. Last Wednesday, Narandas was granted R100â€‰000 bail in
Johannesburg pending an application in the Constitutional Court. But the court
rejected the application on Tuesday. In 2014, Narandas was found guilty of murder for stabbing
Veenand Singh to death outside a Sandton nightclub in 2008. Last year, he was sentenced to 18 years in prison. This was
later reduced to 15. He sought leave to appeal his conviction and sentence in the
Concourt after the Supreme Court of Appeal refused this earlier in the year.
