This did not help employees who earned too little to qualify for a home loan.Ramatlhodi said a project management office and a call centre had been set up for the scheme. Public servants were already being enrolled into the scheme and given information about it.In terms of a Public Service Co-ordinating Bargaining Council resolution, the programme included advice to employees on home ownership options and how to go about renting to buy.According to the resolution, 70% of employees who qualified for the R1 200 housing subsidy did not own their own homes.The GEHS would help employees with their finance applications, facilitate access to housing subsidies, and help negotiate favourable lending terms with financial institutions.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
