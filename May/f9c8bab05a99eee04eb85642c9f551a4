It was first expected to be released in February, then last Friday. Now the new date has been set for May 20. "We are close to being able to release the final report," Motshekga told reporters ahead of her budget vote speech in Parliament. Last year, the department launched an investigation after allegations that principals had to pay up to R30 000 to get a job. According to City Press, which reported on the allegations two years ago, teachers' posts were being sold for livestock, or R6 000, particularly in KwaZulu-Natal. Some members of the powerful SA Democratic Teachers' Union (Sadtu) were implicated. Sadtu had threatened to take Motshekga to court if it was not allowed to see the report before it was made public. Motshekga said legal advisors had told her it was best to give the union a chance to study the report and prepare a response before it was released. Motshekga said Cabinet and many other education bodies had already seen the document.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
