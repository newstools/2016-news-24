They have avoided us," he said.Bey is also known for his roles in popular films such as 2001's Showtime alongside Robert de Niro and Eddie Murphy, 2003's Italian Job with Charlize Theron and Mark Wahlberg as well as 2006's 16 Blocks with Bruce Willis.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
