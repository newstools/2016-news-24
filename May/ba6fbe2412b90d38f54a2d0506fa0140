and found no evidence of wrongdoing, a parliamentary reply has revealed. Of that, R93 148 779 was spent on evidence leaders, forensic
auditing, and a research consultant. The information was contained in a reply by the Minister of
Justice and Constitutional Development to a question by Democratic Alliance MP
David Maynier. The Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of Fraud,
Corruption, Impropriety or Irregularity in the Strategic Defence Procurement
Packages (SDPP) dealt with allegations made in Parliament in 1999. Then-Pan
Africanist Congress leader Patricia De Lille said that a deal to buy new
military hardware for the country could be suspect. The government bought, among other items, 26 Gripen fighter
aircraft, 24 Hawk lead-in fighter trainer aircraft for the SA Air Force, and
frigates and submarines for the SA Navy. On April 21, 2016, Zuma announced that Judge William
Seriti had found no evidence of wrongdoing. Many opposition parties said the
inquiry was a whitewash and a waste of money.
