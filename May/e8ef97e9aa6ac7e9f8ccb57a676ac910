She sees the note and starts shaking. She leaves us &amp; bursts into typical white tears (like why are you crying when all we&rsquo;ve done is make a kind request? lol!)"But the student activist on Monday said he did not mean that Schultz had literally cried, News24 reported.He explained that "white tears" referred to when a person was "challenged to think about a question and they start getting uncomfortable"."It is not literal tears. A lot of people now think that what we did was make all these people cry. No we didn't.Neither the waitress, nor the manager actually cried, he said, and he told them both their message was not a personal attack.&ldquo;It's not true that there was this bullied waitress who cried."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
