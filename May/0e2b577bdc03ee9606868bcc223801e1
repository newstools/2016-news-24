To arrest me. This is Kabila's response to my presidential bid ! According to&nbsp;&nbsp; Bloomberg, DRC's new opposition coalition, the Alternation for the Republic (AR),&nbsp; said in a statement that Katumbi's house in the second largest city, Lubumbashi, was surrounded by government forces just a day after he announced his presidential candidacy.&nbsp; The central African country was expected to hold election in November this year.President, Joseph Kabila,was reportedly still undecided on whether he would be contesting the elections. News 24&nbsp;reported on Monday that&nbsp; a coalition of parties in the central African country had agreed to have Katumbi as their "joint opposition candidate" for the presidential elections. More than 1 000 supporters chanted Katumbi's name as he was declared the candidate of the newly-formed coalition, which groups together&nbsp;16 small parties. But just days after the announcement of his presidential candidacy, the&nbsp;wealthy club owner of TP Mazembe was faced with a probe on charges of&nbsp;recruiting US mercenaries.According to the&nbsp;Voice of America,&nbsp;Justice Minister Alexis Thambwe Mwamba said the government had "documented proof" that several former American soldiers are currently working for Katumbi in the copper mining Katanga Province as bodyguards.&nbsp; However, Katumbi hit back, saying that he was open to a thorough police investigation as he had "nothing to fear from an investigation".&nbsp;Katumbi once served as governor of Katanga, before he left Kabila&rsquo;s administration and joined the opposition. This was after he cl aimed that he had unfolded the ruling party's plan to "violate" the country's constitution. See below some of the reaction on Twitter&nbsp;@moise_katumbi Have you been arrested?
