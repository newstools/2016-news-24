The court heard that on the day of the robbery, September 30, 2014, four intruders gained entry to Sewcharan&rsquo;s home in Bayview, and drugged her other employee, Ncamisile Chiliza, who became unconscious. The robbers ransacked the house and fled with a cellphone, R40 000 in cash and several items of jewellery.Sewcharan was found dead in the wake of the robbery and a forensic pathologist testified she had died of &ldquo;blunt trauma to the chest&rdquo;.Judge Nkosinathi Chili, sitting with an assessor, said the evidence against Sewcharan&rsquo;s domestic worker, Limakatso Mokulubete (30) and her boyfriend, Zamokuhle Ndlovu (27) was circumstantial and based on the fact that unique necklaces that were taken from Sewcharan&rsquo;s home during the attack had been found in their possession. Sewcharan&rsquo;s daughter, Pritha, testified that she had bought one of the chains for her mother as a Mother&rsquo;s Day gift.Apart from the necklace which was found in Mokulubete&rsquo;s bag, she had also made admissions to police which confirmed her involvement in the robbery plan, said the judge. The only evidence linking Ndlovu to the robbery was the unique necklace found in his room just four days after Sewcharan&rsquo;s murder and robbery. However, in the face of this evidence, he had chosen not to testify and give an explanation.The judge said in the circumstances the only inference to be drawn was that he had formed a common purpose with the robbers either through active participation or by association.Chili said however, there was no evidence linking either Mokulubete and Ndlovu to Sewcharan&rsquo;s murder, or to show that they associated themselves in any way with her killing.This was also because there was no evidence that the intruders were armed with any weapons when they entered the house or that all of them had intended for Sewcharan to be killed.Chili said it was unfortunate that Chiliza was unconscious throughout the incident and could not shed any light on what led to Sewcharan&rsquo;s killing. The case was postponed to May 19 for sentencing.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
