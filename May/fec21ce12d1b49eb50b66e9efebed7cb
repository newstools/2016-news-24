He also said that that government was set to buy 1.3 million tons of maize from both local and international markets.According to Agriculture Minister George Chaponda, the country was currently&nbsp;in search of maize from surrounding areas as well as Europe."We have no alternative but to import about one million metric tons of white maize to fill the food gap," said the minister.The development followed a finding made by the World Food Programme (WFP) indicating that approximately 32 million people were in need of food aid due to a rapid decrease in crop production in southern Africa. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
