In July last year, the High Court in Pretoria found Davies's decision to award it the licence was irrational and displayed &ldquo;an excessive appetite for risk&rdquo;.The court gave Davies 31 days to rectify areas in the licence where Davies reportedly exceeded his powers.In August last year, Davies reinstated Ithuba's licence.The Supreme Court of Appeal dismissed Gidani's appeal application in March this year.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
