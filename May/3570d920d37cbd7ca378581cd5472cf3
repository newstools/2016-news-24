The unique item of interest cropped up for sale on a Facebook buy, sell and swop site this week, posted by the new owner. Tania Lloyd-Warren, speaking to News24, said that she came to be in possession of the ancient lift car as a part of a timber reclamation deal. "It was part of a timber reclamation deal when the building was renovated two years back. When they started stripping the building, they uncovered a few gems. There was a glass dome roof that had been covered up for decades which turned out to be the height of architectural mastery of its time. "We came to own the lift by default and we are selling it, but we&rsquo;re still trying to assess its value," she said. "We haven&rsquo;t had any offers yet and if anyone is interested they would have to come and take a look at it&hellip; it&rsquo;s not something you just plonk on the back of a bakkie," Lloyd-Warren said. Architect Patrick Smith explained that, during the refurbishment of a Jet Store between Smith and West streets, they stumbled upon some hidden gems. "The lift had literally between walled off. It is just the car that could be restored. It is one of those old school ones that had a driver that would operate the lift and take people to different floors," he said. "It is impossible to assess the value of it&hellip; it will be worth something to someone," he added.&nbsp;An antique lift discovered during the renovation of a Durban building.
