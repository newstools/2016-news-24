Candyce.KrishnaTHIRTY workers from the Ugu District Municipality downed tools and took to the streets of Marburg on Tuesday to voice their concerns about working conditions.SAPS was called to monitor the scene, but apart from a burning tyre, no violence or injuries werre reported. The crowd dispersed a few hour later, said police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Zandra Wiid.Workers say they have not received uniforms in over two years because of budget constraints, yet they see new contractors and service providers being appointed often.They also claim to be working in an unsafe environment and that sewage plants have become dumping sites.Ugu spokesperson, France Zama, said the action of these employees, to engage in an illegal and unprotected protest , will not be tolerated. The behaviour of this group of staff during the said action cannot be tolerated in a democracy where staff have ample avenues and processes to deal with any dissatisfaction in the workplace. The municipality has since engaged with the South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) to address staff and to understand what the underlying causes for such unbecoming behaviour are . As Ugu District Municipality we are always available to engage in these matters, but we must categorically state that we cannot accept such behaviour that seeks to cause anarchy and chaos and undermine the integrity of this municipality, he said. We are therefore of the view that workers have deliberately been misled with an intention of inciting them to embark on strike action on matters that we as the municipality and the workers have agreed on a formulation of addressing them, added Zama.He said those who had engaged in this activity, which hindered the provision of providing service delivery of water and sanitation, will be dealt with. This action by our workers is regrettable and we wish to extend our apology to the members of the public who might have been inconvenienced by this action, said Zama.Workers say they have not received uniforms in over two years because of budget constraints, yet they see new contractors and service providers being appointed often.
