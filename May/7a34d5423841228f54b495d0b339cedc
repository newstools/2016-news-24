The Supreme Court of Appeal ruled that school governing bodies do not have absolute authority over the controversial feeder zones in the province, nor the final word on whether a school can turn a child away. Fedsas believed the ruling interferes with its powers. The matter will be heard in the Constitutional Court in Johannesburg on Thursday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
