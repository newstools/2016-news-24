The lunchtime pickets started on Tuesday.The union said the picket had only been attended by union leaders from the different schools.General secretary Mugwena Maluleke said the pickets had been organised to highlight the &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; treatment of the &ldquo;child of the poor&rdquo; and working class who are &ldquo;subjected to deplorable conditions of overcrowded classrooms&rdquo; due to the current Post Provisioning Norms (PPN).&ldquo;After many attempts by the union pleading with the Department of Basic Education to review these norms, the National Executive Committee (NEC) resolved to engage in different forms of action, including pickets, to make our voice heard,&rdquo; he said.KZN MEC for Education Peggy Nkonyeni said although the issues being raised were directed to the national department, the province had covered a lot of ground regarding them.She said the province had ensured that schools are provided with an adequate number of teachers.&ldquo;We can say without fear of contradiction that we do not have a problem of overcrowding [in classrooms] in this province. We are confident, however, that the national leadership of the department, together with that of Sadtu will engage and find a solution to this matter,&rdquo; she said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
