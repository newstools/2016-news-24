Period. It is seen as an absolute right and a woman's consent is not required," as well as "I still have to meet a black girl who was not raped at about 12. I am dead serious."&lsquo;People don&rsquo;t know her&rsquo;On Sunday, the 28-year-old Xulu told the newspaper that Jansen had made the comments to Schutte at a time when she was working on a rape case appeal, involving a 5-year-old girl: &ldquo;She was emotional and got swept up in the debate on rape&hellip;&rdquo;Meanwhile, in the Sunday Times, Bongani Xulu - identified as Jansen&rsquo;s adopted son, also defended her.&ldquo;People&hellip;don&rsquo;t actually know her&hellip;Instead of asking her what happened, people are just saying all these things,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;She is very kind, caring and open to talk to people&hellip;&rdquo;Meanwhile, on Twitter, social commentator, Eusebius McKaiser reacted with outrage at the two newspaper reports: &ldquo;Really?! Black adopted kids as anti-racism receipts? Get out of here.&rdquo;Many others on social media also added to the criticism of the news reports, with Lebogang Mohadi saying it&rsquo;s the equivalent of &ldquo;I have black friends. I'm not racist".Following the recent expose by Schutte, Jansen told News24 that the comments referred specifically to the cases she had handled.Earlier this week the Judicial Services Council confirmed that complaints were laid against Jansen by Advocate Vuyani Ngalwana SC in his personal capacity, as well as in his capacity as Johannesburg branch chair of the Advocates for Transformation.The Judicial Conduct Committee will now consider the complaints, and whether they are of a serious enough nature to warrant a judicial conduct tribunal. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
