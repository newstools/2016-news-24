slope. It is understood that members of the community had already
begun ferreting between the mud and debris and had found the man pinned under a
piece of corrugated iron. “We can confirm that the Search and Rescue Unit went to
Umlazi attending a complaint of a house that collapsed. They managed to rescue
a man who was trapped inside and he was taken to hospital,” he said. A police source with knowledge of the recue said that officers
had been called out to several structural collapses and were monitoring the
situation closely. Rescuecare spokesperson Garrith Jamieson said ambulances had
responded to several motor vehicle collisions, and attributed these largely to
the inclement weather. “We have responded to several accidents this morning and we
are urging motorists to drive responsively in the wet weather,” he said. He said additional emergency units had been placed on
standby to deal with the high volume of emergencies.
