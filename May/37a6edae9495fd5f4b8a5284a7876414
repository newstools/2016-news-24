On Tuesday he will visit Diffa in southeast Niger which is home to 200 000 refugees and people internally displaced by the violence before travelling to Maiduguri in northeast Nigeria, a city that has been on the frontline of the battle against Boko Haram. Lake Chad itself has several islands which have been evacuated at the request of the Chadian army to help it fight against insurgents. The area around the lake has thick vegetation which has helped jihadists to move undetected.On Friday the UN Security Council expressed "alarm" at growing ties between Boko Haram and the Islamic State group.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
