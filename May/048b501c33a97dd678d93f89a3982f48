The project is a joint operation between the City of Johannesburg and the City of Ekurhuleni. Mayibuye falls on the border of the two municipalities. Various types of stuffed and preserved rodents were put on display to show residents what to look out for, while pamphlets were handed out listing methods of safely getting rid of them. One of the prevention methods highlighted during the campaign was&nbsp;for residents to keep their surrounding environment clean&nbsp;so as&nbsp;not to attract rodents. A list of requirements were set out for informal food trader services. Apart from having a Certificate of Acceptability and a Trade Licence to operate, establishments were also advised to have, amongst other things, the following: &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A surface for preparing food that is made of smooth, non-absorbent material, that can easily be cleaned; &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tongs and other suitable utensils to handle unwrapped food; &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A refuse bin with a close-fitting lid. According to the municipalities, signs that indicate rodents might be active in a particular area included rat burrows, rat droppings, gnaw marks, tracks such as rub marks, or flattened paths outside burrows. Residents were told to keep their homes clean by washing floors thoroughly and to avoid keeping piles of newspapers, paper bags, cardboard boxes and bottles. Another big attraction for rats was leftover food that isn't discarded in refuse or plastic bags. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
