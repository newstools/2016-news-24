Ndlozi referred to an irate Van Rooyen as a &ldquo;Gupta blessee, weekend special and one of biggest problems in South Africa&rdquo;. The EFF also called the minister a "failed project". Van Rooyen could not get a word in as EFF MPs -&nbsp;including Julius Malema, Makoti Khawula and Ndlozi - refused to let him speak until he answered questions on his trip to Dubai. And when the EFF were rapped over the knuckles for calling various points of orders, Malema said they would allow Van Rooyen the &ldquo;favour of letting him speak, if he just answers the questions on Dubai&rdquo;. Ndlozi, however, questioned whether the minister should be allowed to speak at all, as "today is Tuesday". "The minister should only be allowed to speak on Saturdays and Sundays, because he is, after all, a weekend special," he said, referring to Van Rooyen&rsquo;s three-day stint as the finance minister. This while an EFF MP quietly hummed Brenda Fassie&rsquo;s Weekend Special in the National Assembly. The heckling was too much for Van Rooyen, who asked house chairperson Thoko Didiza to protect him -&nbsp;three times. And just as the minister wrapped up his 15-minute speech, 25 minutes later, Ndlozi raised one last point of order, calling him a "Gupta blessee". He was referring to allegations that the influential Gupta family&nbsp;had appointed him to the finance ministry.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
