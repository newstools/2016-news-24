She had arranged to meet her mother after going jogging in the popular recreational area by herself. When Franziska did not arrive at the agreed meeting place, the family began to worry.She was later found strangled and raped. She had been robbed of her iPhone, watch, headset, and diamond ring.The accused are understood to have been linked to the crime through witnesses, and were found in possession of her belongings.Bail proceedingsDuring bail proceedings, prosecutor Renee Uys argued that Moses - whose father is a warden at Pollsmoor Prison - had no fixed address, as he has been chased away from the living area at the Tokai prison due to his involvement in criminal activity.The State further alleged that Moses moonlighted as a pimp.Easter, Uys said, was a flight risk as he was a foreign national with no ties to the country.He had also previously paid an admission of guilt fine for an unrelated case with a fake name.Mohamed ruled that although Moses had only been living with an uncle for a few weeks before his arrest, he had a fixed address.She also decided that Easter was not a flight risk as he had two minor children and a fixed address.The two other accused, Howard Oliver, whose DNA was found at the scene, and Jonathan Jonas, have earlier dropped their bids to apply for bail.The case was postponed to June 10.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
