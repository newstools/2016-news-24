They paved the way for us, let us honour them and let&rsquo;s plan and prepare a good future for our presidents when they retire,&rdquo; Karay was quoted as saying.Many MPs from the ruling party backed the proposed pay rise, with some arguing that well-paid office bearers contributed more to the well-being of poor citizens and were less inclined to get involved in corrupt activities during their tenures.The development came just a few months after headlines in the media indicated that Geingob was criticised for being overpaid.&nbsp;Geingob, however, fired back claiming that he did not know how much he earned, but that it was less than the N$2 million quoted in some media reports. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
