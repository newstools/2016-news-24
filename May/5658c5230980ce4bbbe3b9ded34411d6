The percentage of people immunised against yellow fever remains low in many parts of Africa, even though the vaccine is nearly 100% effective and relatively cheap. WHO has sent 11.7 million doses to Angola and there are plans to vaccinate 2.2 million people in DR Congo.But it has voiced concern that the outbreak could easily spread to Angola's neighbours Namibia and Zambia, where the population has not been vaccinated.National Red Cross societies in Angola, DRC and Uganda were meanwhile helping communities in affected areas identify and eliminate mosquito breeding grounds and advising people how to reduce their risk of infection, IFRC said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
