Leone Steyn, 22, allegedly started laying the foundation for the fictional child porn ring when she was 17. The matter was postponed to May 26 for the State and the defence to prepare their sentencing arguments. Steyn's attorney, Quentin van Hu&yuml;ssteen, said she was currently undergoing psychological counselling. She allegedly used the fictional child porn ring to gain sympathy and support from Roodepoort residents for the supposed victims. She claimed she had saved them from evil. She claimed to be a victim of the fake ring, and told an online counselling service she knew of 55 other children who were kept at secret safe houses. She allegedly used them to approach churches for help.She never approached the police herself, as members of the Roodepoort, Florida and Krugersdorp police were already involved, Steyn claimed.By the time she had turned 20, the former Ho&euml;rskool Florida pupil had allegedly defrauded churches, residents, and the counselling service of R590 000 in cash and goods.Steyn was arrested in January after a two-year investigation. She was released on bail and then rearrested in April.In April, Van Hu&yuml;ssteen asked that his client be sent for psychological evaluation after one of the complainants questioned her sanity.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
