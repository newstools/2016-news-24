He urged opposition members to bow to the will of the Ugandan majority."Let the opposition parties accept the will of the people and accept the win of president Museveni because he went through elections and won," Lungu said.Making his appearance to commemorate the swearing-in of Museveni as president, Lungu took a swipe at opposition candidate Kizza Besigye, describing him as a football striker who must be substituted due to his inability to "score".Besigye, who&nbsp;won only 35% of the vote during the country's February 18 election, rejected the results and called for an independent audit.The opposition leader has challenged Museveni four times for the presidential seat.Museveni's win sparked outrage throughout the international community, with observers claiming that Uganda's electoral commission lacked transparency.&nbsp;According to the Daily Nation, the influence of police forces on opposition members had also been a bone of contention in recent times, with members of the international community&nbsp;slamming their heavy-handed treatment of opposition members, particularly in the arrest of Besigye on Wednesday evening.Besigye was alleged to have been symbolically sworn in as president on Wednesday, in a protest&nbsp;against Museveni's upcoming inauguration, with the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) confirming the development.H.E Dr. @kizzabesigye1 sworn in today as the President of Uganda. https://t.co/C4fQJfAejm #BesigyeSwornIN&mdash; FDC Official (@FDCOfficial1) May 11, 2016H.E Dr. @kizzabesigye1 sworn in today as the President of Uganda. https://t.co/C4fQJfAejm #BesigyeSwornINMeanwhile, tension is reportedly rising throughout the country ahead of Museveni's inauguration, with opposition members calling for a nationwide protest on May 12.Read more at the Daily Monitor 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
