Rather, the finding was against the former head of the NPA, Advocate Mpshe," it said.&nbsp;"Comrade Jeremy Cronin added that this meant that the NPA was confronted with one of two possibilities &ndash; either to provide rational reasons for continuing not to proceed with charges against President Zuma, or, alternatively to proceed with the charges."Either way, clear action needs to be taken to remove the cloud that has been hanging over our president and the country. &nbsp;"The SACP reiterates its position - as correctly articulated by comrade Jeremy Cronin - that justice delayed is justice denied. Looked at in its entirety the case and the manner in which it was handled constitute a case of justice denied."Mpshe told News24 on Friday that he respected the high court's ruling on his decision."The court has spoken. I respect the decision," he told News24 in an SMS. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
