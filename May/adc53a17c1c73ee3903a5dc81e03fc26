Zimbabwe, which has been been ruled by authoritarian President Robert Mugabe since 1980, has about a prison population of about 20 000.Last year three prisoners were shot dead during a riot over scarce food at the Chikurubi maximum security prison on the outskirts of the capital Harare.More than 100 prisoners died of malnutrition and illness in 2013, according to a parliamentary report.The underfunded prisons rely on donations from charities including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) which provides water, food and blankets.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
