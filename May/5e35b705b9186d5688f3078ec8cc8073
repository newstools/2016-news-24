	     Cape Town – A group of hikers came across a gruesome and mysterious scene on Tuesday when they discovered a skeleton near a well-known hiking path at Llandudno Ravine on the Hout Bay side of Table Mountain. According to Wilderness Search and Rescue (WSAR) spokesperson, Johan Marais, the body was found dressed in denim clothing. The police were called to the scene along with Skymed and WSAR. The guide who accompanied the hikers on Tuesday took them to the scene. “The forensic services and our WSAR operative was dropped off and found the skeleton of a rather small person dressed in mostly denim that had most probably fallen 80m,” Marais said in a statement on Wednesday. The body of the person is yet to be identified but a police investigation is currently underway. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
