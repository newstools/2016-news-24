According to conservancy chair George Victor, this species is particularly noticeable at this time of the year and is popping up all over Kloof particularly on boundary fences and/or walls. “Please act with urgency and remove this species if it is found on your property. “Unfortunately, it has already entered Krantzkloof Nature Reserve where some large infestations were removed by a specialist crew from SANBI in the past weeks. Once established it is extremely difficult to control because it spreads so fast,” he said. Victor described the plant as a perennial, climber with thin stems growing up to six metres high. White or greenish-yellow flowers from March to April. Commonly known as the Lollipop Climber, bearing green fruits with white blotched stripes, later turning red-orange colour - resembles a lollipop, hence the common name.
