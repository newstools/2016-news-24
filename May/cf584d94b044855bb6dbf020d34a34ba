Siboniso Miya has been accused of contacting "a person or persons" close to the State's star witness in the case. &nbsp;&nbsp;This was after a purported Correctional Services strike again delayed the presence of Miya in the morning, prompting Judge Winston Msimeki to stand the matter down so that he could be specially brought from Johannesburg Prison in the afternoon to appear. The matter was then rolled over until Tuesday so that attorneys acting for Krejcir and the four could consult with their clients. Issa was gunned down while he waited at an intersection in Bedfordview on October 12 2013. Police found at least 30 spent cartridges at the scene.Krejcir faces nine charges, along with co-accused Bulgarian Lybohir Grigorov, Mfaniseni Memela, Nkanyiso Mafunda and Miya.On Tuesday last week, the matter was also postponed as a result of an explosive affidavit by a state witness Lucky Mokwena that was introduced as new evidence to the trial.The affidavit, which News24 has in its possession, allegedly links Krejcir to convicted drug dealer Glenn Agliotti,&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;the bribery of police officials.On Monday The Star reported on what was to be a dramatic bid to escape the Zonderwater Prison by the Krejcir.&nbsp;This, according to the paper, was revealed in a bail application of two men arrested last month for their alleged role in the plot.&nbsp;The bid was to have involved a platoon of men armed with automatic weapons storm the prison and whisk Krejcir away to a safe-house in Mamelodi before a series of strategic executions would distract police so he could escape.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
