In a statement, provincial secretary Super Zuma encouraged the media to highlight the &ldquo;great strides&rdquo; that have been made since the attainment of democracy in 1994.&ldquo;A lot has been achieved in strengthening democracy, building solid and independent governance institutions, expanding social services and broadly improving the lives of ordinary people,&rdquo; he said.Zuma said the ANC continues to &ldquo;reaffirm&rdquo; that the media serves the role of being the &ldquo;eyes and ears&rdquo;, or &ldquo;watchdog&rdquo;, ensuring that it reports on the country&rsquo;s transition without bias, fear or favour. &ldquo;This includes reporting with proper context and perspective on structural challenges such as unemployment, poverty, and inequality which are a legacy of our oppressive past, and continue to plague our society.&ldquo;The role of the media remains crucial in our young democracy to strengthen accountability by those who hold public office and protect the interests of the people,&rdquo; he said.Zuma said the ANC would always advocate media freedom. &ldquo;The current debate on media regulation seeks to enhance our democracy and ensure that even the media itself is not used and abused to achieve narrow agendas. Zuma said the party will continue to engage with the media on issues of nation building, social cohesion and other issues of mutual interests as part of building a vibrant democracy. &ldquo;The ANC wishes the media a happy Press Freedom Day,&rdquo; he said. &mdash; WR.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
