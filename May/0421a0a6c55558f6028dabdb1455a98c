The council had immediately initiated an investigation to see if a complaint was before the Judicial Service Commission. Complaint laid Advocate Vuyani Ngalwana SC laid a complaint against Jansen in his personal capacity, and in his capacity as Johannesburg branch chair of the Advocates for Transformation. Cane said that given the nature of the complaint, they welcomed that Jansen would be on special leave pending the investigation. The controversy around Jansen started after journalist Gillian Schutte posted excerpts of written exchanges with the judge a year ago. Referring to cases she had presided over, Jansen said: "In their culture a woman is there to pleasure them. Period. It is seen as an absolute right and a woman's consent is not required." She also said: "I still have to meet a black girl who was not raped at about 12. I am dead serious." As excerpts of the conversation were shared on social media, people expressed shock that a judge could hold such opinions. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
