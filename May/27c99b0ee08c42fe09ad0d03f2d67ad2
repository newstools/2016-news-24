In a statement, spokesperson for Presidency, Dr Bongani Ngqulunga accused journalist Erika Gibson of reporting misleading rumours and gossip against Zuma. “It has become a trend for misleading rumours and gossip to be reported by journalist Gibson in City Press and Rapport every Sunday, purportedly emanating from a source or sources within the South African Air Force,” Ngqulunga said. Plane debacle City Press reported that Zuma declined to fly in Inkwazi when it arrived with fuel flowing from one wing from Qatar.The jet was fully repaired and ready to transport Zuma when he refused, City Press reported. City Press said the president then used a rented aircraft to fly to Durban. Ngqulunga said the Defence Force had indicated it was looking for long-term solutions to the plane debacle which affected Zuma and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa. Last week in Parliament, Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula said getting a new presidential jet was unavoidable. It would not cost R4bn, as widely speculated, she told media in Parliament. The jet has been a point of contention in Parliament with some opposition MPs suggesting Zuma start using the state-owned SAA. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
